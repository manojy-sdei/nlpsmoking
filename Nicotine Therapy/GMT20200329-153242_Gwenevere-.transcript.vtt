00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.130
Angelina C: I just woke up so

2
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.790
Angelina C: I figured I can

3
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, thank you. It's pretty so

4
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.570
Angelina C: Are you on a Sunday, but

5
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. I had

6
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I had set aside some time. I figured, people were going to kind of be going through some roller coaster feelings.

7
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

8
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.190
Angelina C: Well all came in last night, and it's been awful and the other night, the kids and I went to go do laundry up in our friend's house and I don't have service at their up in the mountains.

9
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:18.420
Angelina C: And he knows he knew we were going up there to do laundry. Well, I got tired, we had like three or four loads, we got up there kind of late, and we just stayed the night until in the morning, right, it's about seven

10
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.520
Angelina C: You didn't talk to me and call me mad that I didn't call him so now he says I'm cheating on him. I'm booking every nigger in the store.

11
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.760
Angelina C: at the gas station. That's what I do that, I'm a horn is that he came and got the kids he stayed here last night. So when I woke up and he was like I said, I like your new phone. He's like, Don't talk to me.

12
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.070
Angelina C: And I was like, okay, I was like, whatever. And he's like, I want everything in lining. Now he's like, because the phones are mining. He's like, I want my name if I'm going to be paying on him.

13
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.440
Angelina C: And he's like, they need kept telling me you have to not done kicked out but boy and his terms at the gates and stay but I gotta go.

14
00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.620
Angelina C: And so I said, Okay. Well, I haven't been joined a fight with it because i don't i there's no reason to fight or do you know what we're fighting like why this even came out. Right.

15
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:12.240
Angelina C: So he got up this morning. Got the kids ready and they were outside doing stuff. I knew they were hanging out. I don't want them coming back in here. So I told my Kayla, I'm going to lock my door. I'm getting on with my counselor and the glass.

16
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.660
Angelina C: So, but it just, I'm so tired of. It's like I'm not even doing anything wrong.

17
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.340
Angelina C: And he's sitting here, accusing me like, I mean, just because I didn't have to write down. There's been nights that he didn't remember I told you, and he was answering his phone.

18
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.890
Angelina C: And I and my gut. This is what happened last year and everything was right. He came back with chlamydia, and I didn't have it. But he accuses me of giving it to him.

19
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.400
Angelina C: And now I don't know.

20
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.140
Angelina C: So those of it.

21
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.760
Angelina C: So,

22
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be that you're right.

23
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you could be right and

24
00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This could all be just what's called projection, where he has some guilty. Guilty thoughts and so he's projecting them on to you he you know that could very well be going on and it probably you're, you're probably on to something. Right. But it has to do with

25
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What this means, are you, are you just stressed over. I'm gonna need to go find a place like I really, I can't tell, I'm scared about finding my own place my job feels a little unstable worry about my kids like tell me about the biggest concern is right now.

26
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.590
Angelina C: I think it's just fighting with him. It's just the fighting with him like for no reason. He was supposed to come home on Monday morning, Sunday.

27
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.490
Angelina C: You know, we were all expecting it. And then all of a sudden I didn't come home. We just and he knew where we were. He knows, whose house. We were at

28
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:51.750
Angelina C: You know, it wasn't we go up there all the time to do our laundry, because we don't have water here like he does, he forgets. We don't have water and we can't take showers here, you know, we have to go places to do that. And he's just, I don't know.

29
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.010
Angelina C: I don't know what

30
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.480
Angelina C: He's doing this to me. I don't

31
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if you're saying what's bothering you, is the fighting.

32
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: He, he sounds like he's not fighting, you're saying the kids can live here. You need to go find someplace else. So tell me, tell me what you mean by don't like the fighting.

33
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.460
Angelina C: And he tells me what I'm not kicking you out because I said, Oh, so you want me to leave, what are the kids just going to live here by themselves. I mean, think about that. Like, he's just

34
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.570
Angelina C: I this is my, this is my gut feeling on I'll be on time. This is my gut feeling. And this is what we went through last year.

35
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

36
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.790
Angelina C: Okay, he's down in South Texas like I told you a little comments. He's spitting out like okay with where district of the hosts. Who gives a fuck of their clothes right

37
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah, I remember

38
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.890
Angelina C: He threw that in there. Then he go he left his friend of his truck here, the one that I was that they were all saying was doing math and I think he buddied up with him.

39
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, he's using again.

40
00:04:49.350 --> 00:05:00.390
Angelina C: So down there. Yeah, the way he was acting and he didn't call me for two days. But then he's like, you're just a jealous, bitch. He's accusing me stuff that I've been told me, Kayla I

41
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:10.350
Angelina C: I even tried talking to him this morning about his new phony boxes. He makes so much more money than me. He throws out my face all the time too. I make more money in one day than you do in three or four months.

42
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.090
Angelina C: You know, I don't care. I mean, I'm trying, but I can't live on what I'm making now with the kids. If he's not going to help. I'm gonna have to start something else.

43
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, Angela, Angela, you're not used to trusting trusting your intuition and what I what it looks like. And obviously, we haven't been working together for years. But if, if that's the case.

44
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If the signs that you're describing around cheating and all this impulsivity, this sort of irrational thinking if it is different if he just seems like a different man. And this is what he was when he was using

45
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: walks and talks like a duck Angie, I believe you.

46
00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And even if you're wrong. I understand. Yeah. Any reasonable person would be able to say to him, right, and he would be reasonable any reasonable communication would be, you know what, sweetheart.

47
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It looked and sounded the same and I needed to treat it as if it were the same, that you were using

48
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you really believes that he and all you know using means all of the, you know, lying and irrationality, and maybe sleeping around and high risk sex, blah, blah, blah. The whole macgiolla if that's what's going on. I believe you.

49
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't believe you.

50
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.790
Angelina C: Well, I feel like I think it's all the terms of ever felt like now.

51
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.630
Angelina C: I he was this. I feel. He's just looking for an escape goat, but he wants to fight, but he wants me here too. But then, if he

52
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.730
Angelina C: I just remember when he left us before and he was saying it is for analysis.

53
00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:02.070
Angelina C: And there was this girl from Roswell. It was a stripper. And I just, I threw that in his face this morning and I shouldn't have, but I was like, you don't even

54
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.660
Angelina C: It doesn't even faze me more when we fight it hurts. Yes, because I feel like

55
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:17.820
Angelina C: He promises us so much like he promised we were going to get a new house and save these, like, Well, no, we're going to fix the cars. First, now he's telling me I have to go find a new car. He has three vehicles. We've had forever together.

56
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.720
Angelina C: And he leaves me without a vehicle knowing I have to work.

57
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And Angie. Let's start from basic needs. We need a house. Am I right.

58
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.220
Yeah.

59
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We need food.

60
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We need these days. We kind of need a car that's kind of questionable, your kids are not it doesn't sound like they're in danger. Correct. He's got enough rationality that kids are safe.

61
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:56.280
Angelina C: Yeah, but it's like if Michaela didn't know she's scared. Right, well not scared, but she didn't want to go any told him come back in and pack their bags, when he found out is getting on the phone with you. He told him to come back and impact their bags and

62
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:05.250
Angelina C: Know pack them to pack to leave. So they're going to go stay with her sister, sister, but he right because I saw it, because we have a camera.

63
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.570
Angelina C: When I was he, I called and he was standing there and she answered, like what does she want. And he's like, and I guess my kid. I told her, she's getting on the phone with their counselor.

64
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:22.500
Angelina C: And then it because all his stuff was still left inside. He never even put it in the truck. So that means he's probably going to come back and talk to me like he usually does that what he found out I was on the phone with you. He left

65
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.020
Angelina C: Until the kids to practice bags.

66
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Angie. I know this is really a hard thing when we're in a crisis. But tell me, tell me what good. I'm just going to be devil's advocate.

67
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to get through this with grace. I want you to feel safe. I want you, if you're not ready to leave and end this this part of the marriage of this relationship. Okay then.

68
00:08:50.430 --> 00:09:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to be able to communicate with an addict. You keep trying to get him to take ownership an addict will not. So hold on tight, if you want, do you want to stay in this House.

69
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: For this week for this week.

70
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.800
Angelina C: Yeah, I'll say no, see, he's going to read, they'll be gone. Probably, but yes.

71
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.330
Angelina C: Okay.

72
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're safe, they're okay.

73
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, are you going to stay in this House and your plan is to list out the 50 different reasons why you think

74
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: He is cheating and using drugs again are you staying there because you need shelter and this is a short term situation or are you going to just fight and tell them all the things he's doing wrong.

75
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.800
Angelina C: That's how it feels like I just did you write

76
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The night.

77
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna do

78
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.380
Angelina C: Hey, I'm just lost like I don't know honestly like I

79
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:57.630
Angelina C: I've always got up and left and went to my mom's, you know, and people like just be nice to him so he'll pay the bills. I can't just be like that.

80
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.160
Angelina C: Okay, okay.

81
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm getting at. I'm trying to tease out this right there. We're almost I'm almost saying sort of similar to what your friends are saying. So I'm trying to see, because this is where we get into if you're comfortable, you want to go somewhere else. Great. I'm trying to see

82
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:22.230
Angelina C: No ice. I get mad like before I would I get Mac pack my stuff. Told you know Michaela get your shit. Let's go. But

83
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.690
Angelina C: I told him last time. Do you remember the fight. We got into last time right before I met you, we got in the biggest knock down drag out fight.

84
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.100
Angelina C: That

85
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Appointed that what was the point of that. Why would you bring that up just kind of tell me what was the rationale behind it.

86
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:49.500
Angelina C: Because it was such a bad fight. I was going to leave. I was going to sleep out on the couch. I was in the other room. And then he said he was doing this stuff on the internet. He said that he said that he was gonna have all these black guys come to my work and be

87
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.760
Angelina C: A book or whatever on on Craigslist.

88
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what St. What am I

89
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm saying is why bring up something from the past.

90
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You must have something you want him to do. You must want an outcome from bringing this up because if all we're talking about is I just want to stay here. You said, My biggest concern is the fighting, then, then I think you know how to not fight.

91
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.090
Angelina C: I've tried. Yeah. Today I did it. I did fine. I didn't fight with them.

92
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.170
Angelina C: What did you

93
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do to make that happen.

94
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:37.710
Angelina C: Well I well we argued a little but I mean I just normally it's a word. It's a big out blow out like usually it's huge. And this I just didn't fight back. I was like okay I was agreeing with him or

95
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:48.240
Angelina C: He wants all this stuff go for. I don't care. Like I'm, I'm, I almost feel like we've been through this. So 35 years of my life. This is all 35 years of my life. Yeah, and

96
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:59.460
Angelina C: And it's too much like I want to be happy. I don't have to see her have to go get water and go take showers at people, but he's in a semi he can go take showers all the time, you know,

97
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:07.290
Angelina C: He forgets that yeah and it's like in and then he tells me, oh, I'm going to, because we have guns and stuff. And he's like, well, I'm just going to

98
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:18.000
Angelina C: Give them a Kayla the gun and give them a Kayla, the money cards and so you don't know how I have not been anything on myself. We haven't splurged or did anything I don't make enough to get us to the next to me.

99
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:25.050
Angelina C: And it's hard. And he's like, why being all the bills and everything. I don't know where your money's going well I don't make what you make your

100
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.350
Angelina C: You know, no this

101
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This has nothing to do with the fact that

102
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: He is right, Angie, this is you redoing the same vulnerable child that you were when you were little.

103
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's really scary. But if you say, what's your friend. If your what your friends are saying and kind of what you just said. I, I didn't fight because I just said, Okay, whatever. Or you didn't

104
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Argue your points.

105
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Angie, you're correct.

106
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're a part of it. You've decided to stay with someone that you just got this tiny little crumb from

107
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to do it this week and plan an exit strategy or plan on going back to school or getting retraining, you know, I'm right here where I'm going to cheerlead you the whole way through.

108
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But if all you want to do is get through today.

109
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't want to have to put the pressure on yourself to solve it all today.

110
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you can get through today with grace by accepting that he's in active addiction and he cannot hear your good argument points.

111
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.430
You will not

112
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't win the article.

113
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:57.450
Angelina C: I didn't talk about takes you wouldn't have to the call and I always have I answered it, my employee was ending. Actually, he's like, You lucky big booking record like going off. I was doing Barrett's

114
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.820
Angelina C: But that's

115
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's nonsense. That's a terrible thing to be said to

116
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And your tolerance, because you know people

117
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years have you been tolerating that kind of treatment even since you were a little girl, a long time.

118
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.240
Angelina C: Yeah.

119
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And it hurts and it hurts deeply

120
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.160
Angelina C: Yeah.

121
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.360
But it doesn't

122
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean today. He's going to finally get how he's hurting you today today may not be the day where this man in active addiction is going to get your wounding

123
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. There's no way he can hear you.

124
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to trust someone, someone like a dear friend that knows what you've been through, how much you tolerate

125
00:14:48.540 --> 00:15:00.840
Angelina C: That's why I'm going up there now her mom just passed away last night, I guess. So after I get off here. I'm going to go up and see here. Okay, good. But yeah, her and I were talking and it's awful. Because you know what we were up there. When we were up there. That's who I was with

126
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.090
Angelina C: And I was

127
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.080
Angelina C: Telling her and her boyfriend everything that I know and I've been doing. I've been taught not one to preach, you know, like I told her.

128
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.620
Angelina C: But she's like me. She doesn't have any friends. I said, Don't do that. I said, look, I'm looking at my age, I'm 45

129
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:28.770
Angelina C: You're in the same boat. I was at that age. I don't. I said, if you're not happy because I'm not happy. And she's telling him that, but he won't let her hear it, you know. So I see it too. But it's so easy to tell other people things but for me.

130
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

131
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:30.960
Angelina C: You know,

132
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it's true for everyone. It's really, it's easy, from a distance. That's the privilege of my role to because it's not new. I don't have to face. Wait a minute.

133
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I might need to make a change and it's scary. And it's unfamiliar so many years of your life you're used to people treating you poorly calling you.

134
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're at you're less than your it's familiar. I'm not saying that it's healthy. But it's familiar to you, and you've been putting up with it for a long time.

135
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're getting fed

136
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Up. Maybe you want to slowly. That's my question. If you want to slowly build up the ego strength to go out. Get back in your life with right some semblance of sobriety and

137
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That authentic self and go, go back into the world without drugs and alcohol. You and I are doing the work you're going to work on trauma. It does mean that you're going to see things that you didn't see before you're going to tolerate fewer toxic relationships. So things might change.

138
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.700
Angelina C: Yeah.

139
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't have to. If you want to stay in this relationship with him and hope that he finally sees what you've been through. Okay.

140
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.430
Angelina C: I think it's

141
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:48.780
Angelina C: Like when he was in high school. He wasn't really bad alcoholic. Well, we all drink, but he was really bad, like where he got on the weekends and doesn't come home.

142
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.970
Angelina C: And there was infidelity from way back when, when I had my daughter, and he was doing it at TVs, and he

143
00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:02.130
Angelina C: He doesn't he doesn't remember all that shit when we he bought us a trailer and then broke it down mad busted her all up.

144
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:11.280
Angelina C: And my mom ended up stuck with it, you know, but it was like, even when he was back then when Patricia what 26 years ago my daughter, you know,

145
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:22.680
Angelina C: He was doing that. And it's like, then I started doing it to pay him back. Just because I got, I mean, I was always a stay at home mom and I did work. You know, it just, it doesn't make sense to me that he wants to

146
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:30.630
Angelina C: He like Why start all over. But then again, he's sitting here after coming home yesterday. He wasn't supposed to be home till Monday morning, which I don't care.

147
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.780
Angelina C: And I saw him that TRUCK, BECAUSE HE CAME OVER IN A DIFFERENT trucks. I saw it sitting outside my work because it said out there for a while.

148
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.320
Angelina C: And, um, and then it left and I saw it and I was like oh and I just bothers me that he's

149
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.730
Angelina C: Been like this because I put up with his ship but then I'm not perfect. I get I'm not perfect. By all means.

150
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:58.050
Angelina C: But he thinks I am but like how he called me last night. He's mad over a phone call. I mean, any item and I even told Michaela

151
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:09.810
Angelina C: Even before this, I said he's guilty of something because he's not acting himself, he wouldn't talk to the kids for two days. So that just shows me that he's using again, I believe, but me.

152
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:20.220
Angelina C: Anyone's go spend money on the kids. He's like, yeah, you can blow your money on all your or whatever he, I don't know. He was like he just throwing around and then he's like,

153
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:35.070
Angelina C: The reason is, he will pay the bills here and stuff and I'm gonna have to save us. I can't afford anything right now is what I'm really making you know, yes. So I have to see how it goes. Because I think what I'll do is there. I got this stuff from some housing.

154
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.350
Angelina C: Section eight housing. I've been getting a lot of those on my phone. So I might check into that.

155
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.100
Angelina C: But it's just really hard to understand.

156
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait a minute. When you are using. Are you telling me you don't have huge regrets or huge pieces of time or

157
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: People are like, oh yeah, you don't remember doing this and you're like, man, I don't wanna. I don't want to think about what I did.

158
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you have some of those. Yeah.

159
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.870
Angelina C: Okay. Oh yeah, he's

160
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing that right now and you want to use logic.

161
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: an addict doesn't have a moral compass. You keep expecting the added part to have a moral compass. Remember separate addict authentic self, your husband's not around, and you keep trying to leverage love and honesty and

162
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not he's not going to use that kind of logic is only rationalization justification and blame and he's going to make you feel ashamed and guilty. That's what an addict does. You're telling me you didn't do those things when you were you're hustling around

163
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.650
Angelina C: One night, and

164
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I did that. Yeah, I used to

165
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.240
Angelina C: Lie and hide you only and everything. Yeah, I know I

166
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.350
Angelina C: Noticed was bad.

167
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but I can find them.

168
00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you're trying to use logic right now have a who's who. Does that make any sense. He's not in his right mind he can't he can't use logic right now.

169
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:07.680
Angelina C: Yeah.

170
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand that.

171
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:22.650
Angelina C: Yeah, and that's why he was so excited to leave, he wanted. It's the I thought maybe he stayed here last night that we could talk in the morning, he would have calmed down a little bit, you know, by being home I came in and he didn't. He told me fuck you bitch like all right away.

172
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.140
Angelina C: So, so like whatever I'm fucking everybody and

173
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.430
Angelina C: I just know he has a guilty conscience. I know that because like I told me came over me not making a phone call. I was texting him.

174
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:44.310
Angelina C: He's like, call me when you get home. I said, okay, and I fell asleep, and we got up and we couldn't find my he I mean everything's I'm smoking cigarettes. Again, but

175
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:52.200
Angelina C: It's just little things like that that I watched. I feel nervous I trusted him until a couple of weeks until that he that guy came back.

176
00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:02.550
Angelina C: And then he's like, Oh, I can use this truck and and stuff so I know he brought it back because I almost like asking if you got drip history now, would you be clean. I feel like asking him, but

177
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:10.170
Angelina C: I know he wouldn't be any knows it, too, because he's been. Oh, he's just not. And so I just don't like it. And I'm to the point. I think that

178
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:17.760
Angelina C: We are broke up and split up so many fucking times now that I am so like, it's like okay you left. Yeah, it hurts. Because here.

179
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.840
Angelina C: He got this job. We all agreed that he was going to go down there. I'd stay here and work.

180
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.400
Angelina C: And that, you know, we're going to get a house in a new house in a couple years that we've always wanted know

181
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:33.060
Angelina C: We have the land and everything, but no no he doesn't want that he's he's doing his own shit because he got a hope of the pills probably again.

182
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:42.780
Angelina C: Right, which is better that he's not around me. But like Michaela said my daughter's like I'm not, I'm not going to stay there down the mountain with either going to do that so

183
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.860
Angelina C: So no, I have to see it. Like, I'll have you come get me. But

184
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you hear that, I, I believe you.

185
00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you believe in you, and having to take the whole cold, hard look at you have choices and they're difficult ones, but you're trying to convince an addict that you're lovable and worth it. Well, good luck with that.

186
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.440
Angelina C: And he's a he's horrible he will fight like especially he won't shut the fuck up.

187
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:24.090
Angelina C: So it's just better. I mean, he think I rather him. They're using the new year because I can't handle it when he does it, because when he had mixed before now.

188
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:33.480
Angelina C: When he doesn't. He's just he flops around yells, I mean, he's just not install and almost recorded in one night and caught me and he got mad at me because I wanted to show him out what he does.

189
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:45.570
Angelina C: You know, and it scared me. I don't wake up and find him dead or nothing. You know, it's, it's still part of my life but shit. I can't see that anymore. It just, it hurts me he don't give a fuck you know

190
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:53.280
Angelina C: And he played it off. Good. Last time and then Mikayla was like dad was acting kind of weird well yeah cuz he was using. Yeah.

191
00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.950
Angelina C: And they're going to hit my daughters. And what's so bad as a duet together. So they're going to be over there because going to end up calling me probably

192
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.860
Angelina C: Or kiss his mom because

193
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:11.160
Angelina C: You know, I have to work today. I don't even know why he came in I don't. He wasn't supposed to be here till Monday.

194
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:23.100
Angelina C: So, and then when the kids were. They were just going to leave. I guess overnight, but then when I told him I was coming on with you. They're leaving. They told him to go pack their bags. So I don't know if you think about a week three days what he's doing.

195
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So it hasn't reached the point that you want numbers for for shelters safe house kind of things, or you you don't need something like that.

196
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.480
Well, I'm

197
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:50.460
Angelina C: Always take them because I have had to leave before I even to go to my mom's now it's just, you know, I don't know the shelters. I know of one in Albuquerque excite went to it before, when he kicked us out. When I was pregnant.

198
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to have Russia, so

199
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a couple of things in front of

200
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Me Um,

201
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to double down some numbers.

202
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.540
Angelina C: Yeah.

203
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, I know how far they are. I'm just going to give them to you because you just maybe you'll you'll, you'll find a way to get their boss or

204
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, but so there is a call. You've probably heard of the beret Foundation, a women's shelter.

205
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so 50524

206
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So those first three numbers again are 243

207
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then 4887

208
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.160

Angelina C: And you didn't

219
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, but it's not your fault. It's just that.

220
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's blurry. Okay, now I know next one is a safe house.

221

228
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:38.550

229
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.020

235
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: People just as polite and as sweet and helpful. They sat there and talk with me. I'll cut because I was looking for some some food for people to

236
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so super, super nice people.

237

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's nice to have. Keep those maybe in in your wallet somewhere where if someone grabs your phone, you can still have them or maybe even plug them in your phone.

238
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Away.

239
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:07.410

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.220
Birth Certificate

241
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, have that

242
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Running after run out the door. I mean, I hate to say it, but I'm not sure.

243
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:22.590
Angelina C: What we've done now. And before you know it, what

244
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to show you something. And I don't know if this will be useful or not because I'm still hearing this hope that logic and reason will work with someone on math and it won't. But I get that you want to try

245
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe this little visual might might kind of click in your head.

246
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

247
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There's only so much that we are in charge of and we get confused, we think

248
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That we can get people to change. Let's just look on the outer the outer orange area.

249
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, me.

250
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Without them, are over.

251
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The house.

252
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: My kids. You're like, go get

253
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: 'em.

254
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

255
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You got any orange. We have I'm not in charge of and we'll go over here.

256
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: what others think

257
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.890
Angelina C: I don't know what happened.

258
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

259
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.620
Angelina C: You froze. Okay.

260
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not part of what other people think right here.

261
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Charge. I can't control right now you you let go of that can't control and especially with an impediment.

262
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.800
Angelina C: Doing. Sorry. Don't know what it's doing, it's weird, it's never done it this way before you can

263
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to take yourself off video and see what happens.

264
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:56.550
Angelina C: Yeah, I just never been like this before. I don't know what happened or what I hit

265
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because right now.

266
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's completely normal to me. So I really don't know what you mean.

267
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:08.790
Angelina C: Oh, me too, at the computer screen as well. Yeah, I mean, I'm broke up in two spots as time I see you bigger now like you're on the bottom and I'm on the top. It's weird. So

268
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you do this, why don't you swipe your screen left and see if you can see the poster. I'm showing

269
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.440
Angelina C: That I was looking for. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Oh, cool. There you are.

270
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.300
Angelina C: Thank you. That's what I was looking for.

271
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to swipe left

272
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.230
Angelina C: Yeah, I got it.

273
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Over here, what I am not in charge of what others think

274
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your husband will think what he wants to thank and the revolutionary concept for most of us, is I don't have a right to change your philosophy that's your business, you may want it, you and I may wish and hope and pray. But we're not in charge of it.

275
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to accept what is the one below it. I'm not in charge of what people feel about me.

276
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: They may think right he's calling me all kinds of names not in charge of it can't change that.

277
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not in charge of other people's actions. He's walking out the door. He's doing a, b, and c and it hurts, but you're not in charge of it. He's in charge of his own actions.

278
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not in charge of how other people talk to you. They're going to say things do things. Nope, not in charge of that. How about their judgments and feedback. Nope, not in charge of that. And the last one over here on the right, the consequences of others actions, he

279
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Will have to deal with the consequences of what he's doing. He will have to. You can't spare him.

280
00:31:46.350 --> 00:32:00.450
Angelina C: That's what I feel like he doesn't care. That's a tough one right there. I don't feel like when he, when he especially on stuff. And he's just like I told them, because it's not being instead of comedy one minute coming up next to me. He loves me and the roller coaster ride, you know,

281
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're into

282
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where you in the white is where you get your power back

283
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.650
Angelina C: Okay.

284
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus when you go out into this outer circle. These are things that you'll start to feel like you're going insane.

285
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to stay in here area right because we can't go crazy with all the stress that's going on. I am in charge of my actions I reached out for help to win a beer I texted, and here I am.

286
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you did that.

287
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That was really smart. Yes.

288
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to probably organize yourself well enough that you're going to make it to work, even though there's pressures there. That's amazing.

289
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in charge of your emotions and mood. Now this is hard for people to get a lot of people think that the emotions were not in charge them. They come out of nowhere.

290
00:32:53.550 --> 00:33:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can shift your mind to distraction thinking about other things. Oftentimes when there's this much pressure. It's just getting organized it's writing lists.

291
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's music. It's going for a quick little run there's. It takes a lot of effort, but you can be in charge of your mood and your emotions.

292
00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in charge of whether you go take a shower. Whether You Drive over and you get to decide that you can walk over you can call someone talk to someone, you're in charge of your efforts, your ideas and beliefs.

293
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.700
You're in charge of your motivation.

294
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: consequences of your actions. These are the things that you can do something about these ones on the outer ring.

295
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When your mind starts to go. How could he looked at him and he needs to change. I'm going to fight for it. I'm going to give him. I'm going to talk about how this was

296
00:33:49.260 --> 00:34:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it was before. And I'll make a persuasive argument you're spinning your wheels for nothing. He will not hear you know when he's not when he's neck deep in mess. There's just, it's not gonna happen.

297
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:16.650
Angelina C: He's the pills, because I think he did the pills do. That's why you went to Albuquerque. And I told my killer. I just feel bad. I just want him to go have a good day. I don't want to say like I fed up. Yeah.

298
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's smart because

299
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not

300
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:22.800
When you're not

301
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, you came in today. I said, What is your biggest concern. You said it's the fighting.

302
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And your friends are saying, watch it just be

303
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And I get there, like, you know, kind of write it out, get through this this period of time.

304
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You decide if you really if your psychological damage that you're experiencing around him it's reached its breaking point.

305
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, then you've got some numbers for some shelters and you've got people that you can reach out to if you decide I'm going to wait it out three days 14 days 30 days, you know, three months. Whatever you decide

306
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine, but trying to persuade him that he's wrong during those three months, you will be fighting

307
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And if the fighting, causing you anxiety and uncertainty, then don't poke the bear.

308
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:31.920
Angelina C: Yeah, that's why I say I was upset. I didn't know I wasn't talking like I couldn't figure it out just excited and calm. I call them at seven in the morning when I came off the mountain and he and I talked to him at 230 or text him.

309
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.800
Angelina C: I guess I just said we're staying right here, but

310
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:45.810
Angelina C: I didn't. So that's why he's not talking. That's all that started over and I'm a bit rough looking horror online and then Michaela title your dad, he's like, Don't fucking make excuses and stick up for her.

311
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:47.700
Angelina C: Because

312
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:58.650
Angelina C: He was like, Dad. We had three or four loads of laundry. It wasn't like we were just up there partying or something, you know, we take showers and stuff. It's there's, you know, I took there was three of us all together. The when you know

313
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:08.460
Angelina C: So it's not like it was, you know, and we've got the police. So it was just over that. That's what he has that I know he's using because the way he's treating me

314
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.550
Angelina C: And then I haven't seen him in three weeks you think you'd want to have kissing something he was good.

315
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

316
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were using. And you didn't want to have regret, wouldn't you want him to just go quiet just silent.

317
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't want to build up all these arguments, where more and more damage is done to the relationship so the more that you just sort of sit back

318
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And take care of you. Take care of your, your daughter take, make sure your job and things that you've got to stay on track with your recovery, the less he's going to have to regret.

319
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, because you're not creating these arguments that could turn into domestic violence or bills, don't get paid. I don't know how bad it gets over there with you guys, but

320
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.150
Angelina C: You can call we had absolutely no

321
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:06.720
Angelina C: We had zero like we came out here and he wasn't working. I lost my job. But then I tried counter. So I lost my apartment and everything like we've absolutely have nothing.

322
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.800
Angelina C: And his dad paid our phone bills because I had my counseling with you guys.

323
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:21.060
Angelina C: And then now like he just doesn't. I don't know. It just sucks. It's like we've never been this low night they took. Now the economy's to ship it we're making some income, you know,

324
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:27.000
Angelina C: And he's just but it just hurts me that he's like that. And I just feel like now.

325
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:38.490
Angelina C: You know he doesn't tell me how many he has. But he wants to know how much I haven't what I'm doing with it, but he won't. He doesn't want to know like when I told him after he made, he said to McHale and and to show me like stupid stuff like that but

326
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.510
Angelina C: You know, I'm not

327
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.220
Angelina C: Gonna lose my job over the ship.

328
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And honestly, right right now in a crisis. We're not going to fight really overpriced somewhat Michaela gets the money. It's your pride.

329
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.960
Angelina C: Okay, yeah.

330
00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:03.930
Angelina C: Go ahead. I see, like, I'll give her the get go, I don't care. I'm to the point that I really seriously would rather live somewhere else and have to be here and hear his between every day.

331
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.730
Angelina C: I'm just like, I've been told them I will walk out. I will leave because I do not want to fight.

332
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:19.470
Angelina C: I've left him in Albuquerque before because I did not want to deal with them. Right. And I'll hurt. And that's when it was with that stupid stripper bitch that was staying over there. So I just can't I just don't

333
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.040
Angelina C: And he's like, you know, like, and trust me, and I don't trust us to fucking let's just leave it at that. I was like okay yeah I don't trust him.

334
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:39.540
Angelina C: But he seemed just because, but after I called now he's saying I turned it around on him because he didn't answer his phone for two days. But I wasn't pitching to him. And the way he was acting on the phone and shit. You know, he forgets what he says to

335
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:40.680
You know,

336
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:50.100
Angelina C: Like he will hold up to this trucker and he's like oh, here you can stay on the phone, but if there's not to hookers in his truck. I said, Oh, so you can have girls in your truck, then you know

337
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now have you had a slip or been overmedicating the last few days, no.

338
00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep so good. That's something you feel proud about because this would be a real trigger, most of the time. This is intense stuff. Scary, scary, scary, right.

339
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:19.380
Angelina C: Yes, I, I don't, that's one thing I like I'm that's why I'm God. I don't go with them. Because if they're using over there. I feel bad for Michaela but she's been through it, she already knows so she knows just to call me. But, you know, but then he'll take the truck away from me.

340
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:25.800
Angelina C: You know what I mean. And then start to heal. Take the vehicles and then he'll tell us we have to get out or some stupid shit, you know,

341
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:40.380
Angelina C: So, and then today he stayed out there at night when I went out there to see if the door is open to tell the kids. I was getting on the phone with you. I was right there and I saw his stuff still in the chair and then when they came back in to get their things as when

342
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:44.160
Angelina C: Because, like, no, he told us to pack our bags. I was like, okay.

343
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:51.120
Angelina C: So the price because I don't know if he was planning on saying he's coming back or trying to talk to me. But he just left so

344
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:53.190
Angelina C: I don't care.

345
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well whether you care. It's not something you can control, he's going to do what you

346
00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:58.920
Angelina C: Do

347
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you do today where you can feel like you are in charge of today.

348
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.680
Angelina C: I'm just going to do me. I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna go up to my friends and see her a bit and and go to work. Yes.

349
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.860
Angelina C: I'll take all my stuff with me to get ready for work and ready

350
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You want the truth of the matter is, you're being happy and not ruffled because having a tantrum.

351
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:34.530
Angelina C: Yeah, I, I told him to I hung up on him, I was like I'm at work. I can't deal with this shit like he would not let me get a word in otherwise like he was just yelling at me and then like now he has to

352
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.340
Angelina C: Like today and he's want everything. And I was like, and I he was seeing here and Ben, I was trying to be nice. I said, Oh, I like the phone. He's like, whatever. Don't talk to me.

353
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:52.590
Angelina C: And then I said, you remember that last fight we got into and he just kept over talking over talking to me because I remember that we promise we're going to go get here again, but he he's in his own mind, like you said, he's lost on the drugs and shit.

354
00:40:54.120 --> 00:41:00.420
Angelina C: And not counseling is going to be like like know he'll say, oh, that's fucking good for you because I'm talking to you and not fighting with him.

355
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you know what to say when he says that

356
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can use this statement all day long, every day.

357
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no right to change your opinion. That's all you say

358
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.380
Angelina C: Okay.

359
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.120
I'm not kidding.

360
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no right to change your opinion of me. I have no right.

361
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To understand hold on to that. Think about what that says. And he's gonna think yeah yeah that's, yeah. Yeah, and I think your agenda. And then you say, well, I don't have a right to change your mind about that.

362
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just stick with it when. Notice how I don't talk about the content about what he says whether I'm a horror or not, whether I cheated. Whether I texted this or that. I don't say any that's all content.

363
00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When you meet someone around content you're going to be in an argument, if you take what I'm describing, which is a neutral statement which is

364
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that circle I showed you this is how you you actually manifest it and say, you know what you and I are in a kind of bad place right now and I have no right to change your opinion of me over and over and over and over again.

365
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.800
Angelina C: Was the beginning you said it was good to

366
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I are having a really hard time

367
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

368
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we are. Well, it's all your fault. He'll say around, turn around and say,

369
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I realized I don't have a right to change your opinion of me.

370
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.310
Angelina C: Yeah, like that.

371
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So neutral and then he'll say, That's right. And, you know, my opinion is, and he'll go off. But you know what will happen if you do it a third time and a fourth time. There's nothing to fight against

372
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.640
Angelina C: Well, yeah.

373
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. I can't change your opinion of me, you have every right to your opinion you do or you don't say nasty.

374
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The

375
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Things is we can do this with grace and integrity. If we can find the bit of truth. Remember that circle I showed you remember I was saying you're not in charge of his opinion.

376
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And how I said you keep trying to get him to see something to make a point for now for the next while while he's he's neck deep in his drug use.

377
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish wouldn't do it. I would use those neutral statements. What you're talking about is really important to you, I hear you. I don't have a right to change your opinion of it.

378
00:43:45.450 --> 00:44:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If he says, What do you want. Well, okay then you know maybe you want to share i i'd like to stay here and feel safe. I'd like to have an extra $200 a month automatically put in the bank account. I'd like to have the water on but he's not going to ask so

379
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you and I will come back and we'll figure out what to do. But for now, if you don't want to fight because that's what you came in today. You said it's the fighting.

380
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you go neutral, you are or you're going to fight air. There's nothing to fight.

381
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you don't give content. Well, what about this other time of year ago and you did this like a sexy thing. Now that's content you're talking about content. What's there's nothing to say when you all you're saying is

382
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't change your mind about me. I have no right to change your mind about me. I've been trying. That's true. I I'm coming to terms, I can't make you see me in a different way. I see that now I see that I have no right.

383
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's just over as I you know I rephrase it three or four different ways. And I just

384
00:44:46.140 --> 00:45:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just neutral. We are going difficult time you are going through a difficult time. I can hear in your voice something really big going on. We're both going through something really intense right now and I don't have a right to change your opinion of me.

385
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.340
Yeah.

386
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.110
Angelina C: Have you done

387
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything like that where you think that somehow. If you do that, back to back for maybe five times.

388
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Over and over, because right he'll test to see if that's true. Try and provoke you again with more NASTY ACCUSATIONS and judgment words and profanity. Have you ever done that to see if he can, if he will neutralize and maybe he'll go for a drive or he'll kind of storm off. They'll disengage.

389
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:51.480
Angelina C: And know we just Gallo by using on the walkway. I always walk where I walk out. I'll leave. I'll even give up. But I'll pack my Sydney and that's that's what it's been like when we were saying as my daughter.

390
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.930
Angelina C: She was in Jia

391
00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:12.060
Angelina C: Him and I got into it over there and he went to stay with a friend. So I forgot what I was saying. But anyway, it's, I don't know. He's just so mainline does like poof. But yeah, it's, it's a lot. He's just he is. It's just a lot. I know he's using because he doesn't treat me like this, otherwise.

392
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you know

393
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard, you need to believe you.

394
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:17.970
Mm hmm.

395
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:27.150
Angelina C: And that's and you know I we have split up and gone, our separate ways and and and I even that's what it's all about four years ago, I thought

396
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:35.430
Angelina C: I've got over him. I thought I could get over him by sleeping with somebody and I thought that was I could get over and we weren't talking. He swears, we were together.

397
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:46.350
Angelina C: And then he found out that I was talking to this guy, and every since then, he will grow that my face but when Mikayla, was born 16 years ago.

398
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:57.390
Angelina C: He was taking my my other daughter patrician all our four pillars over to the strippers house and he was staying there for the weekends and stuff when I was home with the baby and he would come home and live here and come sleep with me.

399
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:08.670
Angelina C: So now I told him, I said, yeah, that was a one time to time thing. It's nothing I did, I regret it. It was something that hurt me more hurt me more than

400
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:15.120
Angelina C: I think Kim because I felt bad for hurting him because it wasn't something I wanted to do, but it was, I was so mad.

401
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:22.410
Angelina C: It was something stupid. I've learned from it. I don't even think of other guys like I don't even go down. I'm so I have so much more going on that.

402
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:32.310
Angelina C: That doesn't even cross my mind. And now I think he feels like when we fight like this, he probably wants me to quit the gas station. That's what his problem is. He's jealous that I'm working, I guess.

403
00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:34.920
Angelina C: I don't know.

404
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.890
Angelina C: That he's just, he's just

405
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't change that thought.

406
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's probably thinking when he gets out of it when he gets clear headed when he gets sobriety. Again, then you can have them we can get into content.

407
00:47:52.620 --> 00:48:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: None of it's going to stick. You're just, you just, I mean, I know I'm being really concrete with you, but I believe you. When you say he's using he's not going to remember things he's only to remember the next moment, the next thing they

408
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:05.970
Know,

409
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:09.180
Angelina C: But I just don't understand why the fight like

410
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:19.770
Angelina C: I mean, I do like I haven't told I mean it's, it hurts anything but it's kinda like I expected x i already felt like he was cheating. When he didn't have to start and maybe it's just cheating with the drugs. I don't know. Maybe he's not doing that and maybe he's

411
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:30.690
Angelina C: Just with themselves. I don't know. But whatever he's doing it's, you know, after three and a half weeks and not seeing him. He was all happy to come home this weekend and for him to change just overnight. Just because I didn't answer my phone.

412
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:38.490
Angelina C: Come on, let's just, it doesn't. I don't care about it though I have, like I said, I have other things to worry about, you know,

413
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:48.930
Angelina C: So it's just, it's not there, but I am going to roll with it. Like, I mean, and then I told them to. You want me to leave. I said, What do you want the kids to go to think about that stupid like where the kids going to go

414
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.860
Angelina C: So he's like they don't have to leave what you do and then he's like, I'm not kicking you out.

415
00:48:54.060 --> 00:49:02.550
Angelina C: I was like, okay, he's like, but he does pay off. He is paying the bills, but he that was a deal and he left. Anyway, he was going to be all the bill the utility so

416
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is he not paying the water bill. I don't understand.

417
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.100
Angelina C: Okay, so we have a water leak underneath the house and it's been licensed since my daughter left here.

418
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:17.610
Angelina C: And when we were living in town. And so when we came back out here we have a leak under there. So our bill was like 300 and some odd dollars.

419
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:29.550
Angelina C: So he hasn't paid it. So he told me to go pay X i was credit card and I forgot to on Friday for them to come turned on, but we have to turn all the water off just flush the toilet. Let's turn it back on, you know, so

420
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When you well okay, when are you going to go pay that bill before he pulls that credit what, yeah.

421
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.570
Angelina C: When Monday I have his credit card number here so I'm gay.

422
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:47.730
Angelina C: Straight away. Yeah. And then like last night. He wanted the kids to order pizza, and he's like, he's like, Would you like would you do it for me, like, have your mom do it.

423
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:56.880
Angelina C: Why didn't carry that around with. Now I'm going to, but I don't carry it around with me. So I had to pay for it. And it's like, you know, 20 bucks is a lot for a pizza, I think.

424
00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:03.990
Angelina C: You know, but they were happy they got it. They got the change and everything so I can keep the chains and stuff, but I just don't want

425
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:15.780
Angelina C: You know Michaela does check on me. She worries and she does, because just because I deadly with her dad up in June, you know, we were together. I had my apartment and I act like I was I was lying or telling her, I was working and

426
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:21.780
Angelina C: And all this stuff. And we went to Washington or Nevada or something and I went with him. She didn't even know we were talking yet.

427
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:38.430
Angelina C: So when he got back, I told her the truth. You know what happened. And out of all people she's the only one has ever stood by me through my sobriety through anything. My 16 year old and he's more than meaner one kind of more blunt like straightforward, but

428
00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:47.550
Angelina C: Like she told me this morning. She's like, you know, Mom, I do go check on you at work, just one day they can done. It was like last night, I was like, What are you guys doing it's freezing outside

429
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:58.920
Angelina C: Like we just want to come see you and it's just right here. It's not like I mean it's a good walk, but it's not bad. You can even see the sign for our house, but it's like they walk down there and

430
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.860
Angelina C: She does. She said she comes and checks on me because I had lied to her.

431
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:17.910
Angelina C: And I told her I went with her dad so she doesn't know like her dad's here and I'm saying I'm at work or not. And I'm leaving because that's what I did to her house Center. I was working. I was up at April, I was doing all this stuff and and the whole time I was with him.

432
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.850
Angelina C: And so she was she's real heard about that. And I don't mind. I love them to come to my work.

433
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:29.490
Angelina C: You know, I'm not hiding anything I have nothing to hide. Like, I have nothing to lie about we've gotten everything out.

434
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:36.660
Angelina C: And he's like, yeah, we're going to do a lie detector test about when you are in rehab and if you're fucking rock I said no i was i was yeah I remember we went through this already. Paul

435
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:43.800
Angelina C: I was fucking around on you and me having this and now he's like, you know, I'm not gonna waste my money on a lie detector.

436
00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:53.970
Angelina C: And then he'll come back to me like oh are we over who said we were over, but look at how he's treating me what he would do think, I think we're over, wouldn't you just yet. He's saying

437
00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:00.450
Angelina C: That's what I would feel like. And then he'll come on back. Whoever said we were over, we were just fighting

438
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:07.350
Angelina C: Telling the kids. We just had an argument. We were just fighting. But then, but then that's when he sobered up

439
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:16.830
Angelina C: So let's see how long this last with him via run back and forth and get his pills from this dude back and forth with that other do those two are going to get like something bad's gonna happen to him.

440
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:25.260
Angelina C: Or he's gonna die on that ship I did and he knows that he's stuck doing it literally died so

441
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.390
Can change.

442
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do today with grace.

443
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

444
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be grateful for this daughter that loves you. You can be grateful that the pride in each day that you stay on track with recovery that you're not falling apart.

445
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Paul is losing it. You're not going to fall apart. You're going to stay centered to do the next right thing

446
00:52:54.570 --> 00:53:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, just be in relaxed vigilance, you'll keep your eyes open. You'll stay conscious and if you'd like some of those phrases you can just go neutral.

447
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you may not have as much or as intense or as long as arguing, they'll probably say something like this. Oh, that's that stupid psychobabble bullshit from your counselor that some stupid shit. It doesn't matter. You say the same thing. And again, Paul, I

448
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't change your opinion about that.

449
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it over and over and over and over.

450
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And over and over. If

451
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You think it's funny, but

452
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.050
Angelina C: No, it's not. Hey,

453
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to give it a try. Because then he's fighting the air and he's gonna get bored with it. There's nothing to fight and then he'll go to, what does this mean the end. This means you're leaving. What does this mean

454
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going through a tough time right now, aren't we. Yes, we are. Okay. Yeah.

455
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.680
Angelina C: That's it.

456
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

457
00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no content. You said as soon as I stopped talking, you go into content. The call the accusations, you dip into it. It is probably going to be one of the more difficult things you do.

458
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:16.380
Angelina C: Is not going to content. Well, that's why I went, I went to rehab to the anger management and domestic violence. I took that class three times.

459
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.030
Angelina C: Three times. Yeah, right. I got into rehab.

460
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Have you ever heard anything tried comments. These two things. Obviously, you always breathe. That's the key because that's how you'll remember, these two things are you brought him on your hand you breathe.

461
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say,

462
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going through a really difficult time right now and I don't have a right to change your opinion and that's all you say okay

463
00:54:47.280 --> 00:55:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But you depend to justification and having to make your point to him to win the argument you will be in an argument. Again, you have some control over you, not what he thinks, not what he does.

464
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You can control the words coming out of your mouth and the first thing to do.

465
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get quiet and breeze.

466
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you'll remember, maybe these are hard to remember because they're not. Most people don't talk like this.

467
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.630
Angelina C: Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

468
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I would literally put those two statements in my pocket. You can use them with a boss, you can use them with a colleague, you can use the customer.

469
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.650
Angelina C: Yeah.

470
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what, sir, I don't have a right to change your opinion about this. That's it. You can use them everywhere. You can even do it to me. I would laugh. I mean,

471
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:46.830
Angelina C: Come on.
