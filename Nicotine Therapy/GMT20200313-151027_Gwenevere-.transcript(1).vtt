00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Jackie.

2
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How long were you on me to wait in in the clinic.

3
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.720
Jackie: I actually bypass it because it usually takes forever for me to check in. Should I have gone there first.

4
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, I've been catching a lot of flack about that.

5
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

6
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I head head over there. I'll stay here.

7
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.440
Jackie: Okay, I'll be right back. Sorry.

8
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.220
Okay.

9
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.210
Hi.

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you checked it in the virtual clinic.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.040
Mom.

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, um,

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are your little dudes snoozing or just

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.530
Jackie: Playing air my room watching a movie. My younger one was really sick. Last night he threw up like a couple times and

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.960
Jackie: You had a fever. So he might be in and out here a lot. So, okay.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I completely understand. Yeah.

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.590
I

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, everybody. This is the is a very pressing issue for people

20
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.380
Now,

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I've had a couple clients, this morning, and I'll bring up the topic, and then you talk about it as long as you want to.

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This coronavirus is affecting all of us at this point in one shape or form, whether it's just fear based or re educating ourselves like personally need to educate myself more

23
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like sit here in isolation in my home.

24
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but it does affect I was going to do some traveling to Seattle in April.

25
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So that might not happen. And so what about you, what does it make you think about

26
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:14.910
Jackie: Um, since they shut down like schools yesterday that's been. I don't know. So going to the stores and seeing like empty shelves and stuff that's really surreal. And they're like, shutting down schools and

27
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:26.100
Jackie: Like so many things are closing down and that's even more surreal. So it's kind of like it's just really weird. I don't know. It's hard to believe that this is real, right.

28
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks apocalyptic, doesn't it.

29
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.910
Jackie: Exactly, exactly.

30
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So the thing about Florida. That's a little different is

31
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I experienced this every year. So there's a hurricane season over here, and every single year. Everyone does the exact same thing we

32
00:02:47.460 --> 00:03:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All go through months of especially if there's an actual storm we do it just on a regular basis. Our whole all of our we just behave differently. And then when there's a storm coming. It's just all consuming so we go through this every year.

33
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.140
Jackie: Yeah, I thought about that, actually. So I guess.

34
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.930
Jackie: In that sense, I don't want to say desensitized which you guys are doing it in a way, it's just a different subject, I guess. Yeah.

35
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So, and, but it doesn't mean I mean I might be minimizing it, I might need to go get some supplies but

36
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't

37
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.500
Jackie: I mean, good luck. At this point, I don't know if it's the same out there, but I'm sorry I got really bright

38
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:42.570
Jackie: Like the shelves are so bear here there's like nothing, there's nothing. It's really crazy and think the scariest thing to me too is knowing that we don't know what's going to happen next.

39
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.520
Jackie: Yeah, there's like no cure, you know, no one really knows what the next step is we're just going, day by day, that's weird to I'm used to, like,

40
00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.210
Jackie: Being reassured bill being like, Oh, no, this is what's going to happen. Don't worry, where people are like, no, like, you should isolate yourself because we don't know what's going to happen that strange

41
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The other, the other half of that might also be plenty of people have had it and their natural immune system handled it just fine. Right.

42
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.950
Jackie: That too.

43
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's also happening and folks that are older and have challenged immune systems.

44
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: They're challenged by a lot of dis ease so

45
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I don't know. I guess that's where it sits for me doesn't

46
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean it's the right version.

47
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're always vulnerable.

48
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.770
Exactly.

49
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.160
Jackie: An interesting thing to be going through. I guess it's really weird.

50
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It is weird does

51
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To have schools like I texted you. I said that one of my son's colleges cancelled. And that's a really big deal.

52
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.900
Jackie: Saying my classes are switching to online classes and we're heading into finals. So we'll be doing finals at home, which is good for me.

53
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:12.690
Jackie: It's still really strange and my kids can't go anywhere for three weeks because their daycare in Pre K runs off of public school schedules. So they're doing the same stuff.

54
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.420
Jackie: Well, yeah.

55
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of pasta. Lots of adjusting and I pretty much just, I just figured these are chandelier issues. I'm still very blessed to have, like, we're going to be okay.

56
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.260
Gonna be okay.

57
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just going to get more education and sit with you all, as you guys kind of work through

58
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.520
Jackie: Sorry, I didn't move this. It's so bright.

59
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: When you've got some nice sunshine coming in there.

60
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.600
Jackie: You know it's morning, late

61
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time.

62
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can find a place that feels like you're not getting

63
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: With sunbeams there.

64
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.780
Jackie: That's probably a little better.

65
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.300
Jackie: So distracting. Is that okay, of course, it's okay. Okay.

66
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:13.770
Jackie: So yeah, the other thing, too, is my son being really sick. Of course the first thing in my head is like, Oh my God, did he get it, but they don't think it's that nobody thinks that's the case because he has like a runny nose and stuff. And it's probably situs yes so

67
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't help it. I your that's gonna be the first thought. Right now I

68
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: can't help it. I did too. I had a little runny nose, last night I was like

69
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, Hey, guys. Hey, I have a dry cough.

70
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.750
Jackie: Then you start getting worried about every little thing. Yeah.

71
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I think I'm gonna like my, my family went out to dinner. I didn't go. But I mean, they

72
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody kind of handle is just a little bit differently.

73
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.860
Exactly.

74
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you is this to the point that it's nightmares. Are you noticing, you're not able to concentrate. Is it getting to that degree.

75
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.160
Jackie: No, not really. It's just like I said surreal. I'm

76
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:16.290
Jackie: Not horrified or terrified or anything. We're okay in our house. We have food, you know, we have what we need. Essentially, I don't. It's just, it's a little scary, but I'm not like having nightmares. I mean, I have nightmares, but not over this.

77
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you want to talk about that for a little while, or do you want to lose your focus WHEREVER YOU WANT TO TODAY IS NOT A like a review treatment objective kind of day, we can go. We can drift around move and groove wherever you want to.

78
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you want me to take the lead. I have never a problem taking the lead.

79
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.140
Jackie: I think you should take the lead.

80
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I already started kind of snooping around in here and I wanted to check something I've opened up a note for today, but I wanted to just take a peek at this one. On March six wanted to look back at that one for a moment and just see something

81
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is interesting.

82
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why for some reason the notes aren't moving over to the new note that's that's a concern for me.

83
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like that.

84
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not in the note for today. I just double check.

85
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it should do. Save As and move over. Wonder what. Oh, I think I know what I did wrong. All right, let me see if I can redo this

86
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I

87
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.490
Don't think I can. I think

88
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta do a little something here. You don't need to hear the narration is boring stuff. But let me, let me just get my current note, together with things we've done it just didn't move over.

89
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.320
didn't save

90
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was human error. I think it was me.

91
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I did a Save As, but it was from February instead of three six copy. Let me see if I can grab this guy because you did some work. See it, I can see it.

92
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to 313 13

93
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.270
Hey, we can add that

94
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not forget that one. If we really want to mess up our heads here.

95
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.630
Seriously.

96
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for the reminder

97
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.780
Jackie: Oh no, I'm glad I have nothing to do today, so I'm not worried too bad.

98
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

99
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're good. We got that in me. Oh.

100
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do, let's populate more in in the subjective unit of distress. Let's get a little more understanding or me understand more about this thermometer this this sort of register of, you know, how you said, Well, I do have some nightmares. But it's not about this virus.

101
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, things are intruding in your unconscious. I don't know what your belief is about dreams.

102
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But it seems like you've got some intrusion in there. It's trying to subtle. I think trying to find a

103
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Arresting, where will it rest. What will be the summary, what are we going to do with this information. So let's just say we start with this.

104
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's a connection between maybe the dream and maybe some of these experiences you've had in your life, so I'm

105
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm looking at the the scale from zero to 100

106
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Got them all listed over on the left hand side. And I'd like to populate it with a couple of experiences that you've had.

107
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you decide how much detail you want to give me. I basically want to know the age, I'll ask you, maybe what was going on. What was the negative cognition. What was the emotion. I'll probably ask a couple of things like that.

108
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears are really bad this morning. So you're going to see a lot of that. And I apologize. You don't have to take care of me, just let me know. I'm gonna look really weird.

109
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: As I usually do.

110
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

111
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to 50

112
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Not chill zero is like I'm in a relaxed body. I feel safe.

113
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing's really bugging me. That's kind of what the zero is and it's consistent with the way the mind is settled and the body's not activated. It's out of zero.

114
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Hundred typically is where fight or flight gets activated not freeze freeze with people low that zero

115
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.530
Jackie: Okay.

116
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We can talk about that in a minute, just for now let's just tap into.

117
00:11:46.950 --> 00:12:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: fear, anger, probably going to be the primary emotions up there probably won't be were sad moves. Typically when we're activated to fight into flight. We're up there with anger and fear. So, can you can you think of an incident where you were at about 50

118
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have been able to still think straight blood was still flowing to your prefrontal cortex different parts of your brain were still communicating with each other.

119
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it was distressing at about a 50 don't get too hung up on the number just want to know the first kind of story that came into your mind.

120
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:38.820
Jackie: And probably just like maybe a week go whenever I was taking a bath and my husband was putting the kids to bed, and they were like really fighting going to sleep and

121
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:47.400
Jackie: He got frustrated and yelled at them and I like heard him yell at them and then like I sat there and I was thinking about it, I was like, oh, you shouldn't be doing that, but I was like

122
00:12:47.820 --> 00:13:01.860
Jackie: No, if I yell at him, then it's just going to make it worse. I should just let him deal with it because I know he's going to end up apologizing. So like it was a lot of discomfort, but I was able to think about it. Think about my actions and what I should do realistic. So I think that

123
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:03.810
Yeah.

124
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I apologize.

125
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.500
Jackie: If he did

126
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have to bring it to his attention.

127
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.580
Jackie: Did I have to probably not, but did I. Yes.

128
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you did eventually got out about something you talk to them.

129
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. This is about a week ago. And how did it sound when you addressed him about the yelling

130
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.760
Jackie: I was like,

131
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.170
Jackie: You know, I really hate the way you

132
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:48.240
Jackie: get frustrated and end up yelling at them. I was like, I don't think they deserve that just because you're frustrated and I probably approach it the wrong way. Honestly, but that's pretty close to how it sounded, but it was just really bugged to

133
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't write down the last part, I really hate the way you get frustrated with the kids. I don't think they

134
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.390
Jackie: deserve that.

135
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: deserve that.

136
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think they deserve that.

137
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

138
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

139
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you could you keep up already got

140
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

141
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.460
Jackie: Oh my gosh.

142
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, I should bring my puppets out

143
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.620
Jackie: It was gonna be popping in and out.

144
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Alright, yeah.

145
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, so don't don't apologize, what this can do is it can create enough of a distraction for you.

146
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to.

147
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What may end up happening is your first response, you might end up saying it quickly and, naturally, because you're going to be a little distracted with him. So just let that happen. Okay.

148
00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:57.840
Okay.

149
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Air Conditioning way too high. I've got like a parka on right now.

150
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.530
Jackie: I saw that I was like, wow, it must be cold there.

151
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's probably not a big baby.

152
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: My baby.

153
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, he should not hear you.

154
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Nice. Okay, so the distress level the subjective unit of distress. What number would you get that last week.

155
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.970
Jackie: My distress.

156
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we're going to give it a number from zero to 100

157
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Hundred is

158
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:39.870
Jackie: When you say it was yeah accurate. I got it all move that down right there. Beautiful.

159
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and the emotion. Emotion word that you were feeling you're, you're in the bathtub can hear it doesn't match the way you would be parenting.

160
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.200
Jackie: It right

161
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the emotion, you're feeling

162
00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:04.170
Jackie: irritated and frustrated or the first two words, they came in my mind. Okay. But I guess kind of disappointed to

163
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the thought or belief that goes with disappointed.

164
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:17.700
Jackie: That like I've kind of talked to him about this before and he should be a little more patient with them like you should know by now, I guess.

165
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to get something to entertain him.

166
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: With that film. Right. Or does he just want the snuggle time

167
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.450
Jackie: Exactly. He just wants. Yeah, to lay

168
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it. I just wanted to offer it. Okay, yeah, of course. Um, and that makes a goodness gracious. Oh, you're gonna make me cry. I'm in such a crybaby move today. I always

169
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew I was going to get lots of baby time because everybody's kids right around. I was like, well, I'm

170
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna get to see lots of kids today.

171
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.660
Jackie: So cool.

172
00:16:52.230 --> 00:17:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have really a complex emotion of irritation frustration and disappointment and a belief, he should know by now.

173
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.790
Exactly. Okay.

174
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's harder to get to this one is

175
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: He should know by now is the thought.

176
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: See what that says about you.

177
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.500
Jackie: Is that I'm sorry, see what

178
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: See what that says about you. So go to he should know by now. I told him this already see what the I Am I believe I am see what see what the belief about you is right in that moment and be patient with yourself, because these are harder to get to

179
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.670
Jackie: Just take

180
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What rush, don't rush. Just go go dip into the emotion dip into the should

181
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Dip into

182
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Why already know the outcome. I can predict this is how it's going to go.

183
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go there for a little bit and see what comes up. What's the belief about you.

184
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:16.050
Jackie: That I have a better way of dealing with the kids than he does.

185
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.950
Jackie: Is that really true. I don't know. But that's how I felt. I guess.

186
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I have a better way of dealing with the kids.

187
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it's I'm better than him.

188
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.940
Jackie: And more patient than him.

189
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. I am working

190
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

191
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And how true is that would you say zero to 10 I'm more patient than home.

192
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.580
Jackie: Pretty, pretty true in most situations, probably about it at eight or nine

193
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So 8.5

194
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.090
Jackie: Yeah, there you go. Okay.

195
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you like that meaning endorse, do you like that belief. I'm more patient than him.

196
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:18.930
Jackie: I mean, I don't really know if I like it or dislike it. It's just kind of true. Yeah, I guess I like it, I guess. Yeah, okay.

197
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's go up.

198
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, as you're thinking about that incident, about a week ago. Um, let's see if there's any somatic register. Did you notice as you were talking about it. You felt it anywhere in the body.

199
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.600
Jackie: My hands, probably, I guess, fidgeting. A lot of my hands. Okay. And Judy.

200
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.300
Judy.

201
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go a little higher.

202
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go maybe 70 maybe something a bit hard to stressing where it was a little harder to think straight to use logic and reason to put yourself, both in the moment and into the future, which takes all that prefrontal cortex. It's a hard thing to do. It's a very evolved thing to do.

203
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a little bit more intense.

204
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience, maybe a story around that.

205
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.640
Jackie: This can be like his older his recent oh

206
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all

207
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

208
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.130
Jackie: Sorry, let me think for a second.

209
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:59.880
Jackie: Probably. I mean, this is kind of like over a general period of time, but like when my dad would take my mom's side over like blatant lies.

210
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:09.630
Jackie: And usually they were against me and I would be like, no, like, this is the truth. SHE'S LYING AND I KNOW HE WOULD KNOW IT WAS SHE WAS LYING. But he would still

211
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:19.440
Jackie: Like side with her and get mad at me and take it out on me, even though everybody use you as lion, including her that was that's really hard to deal with.

212
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.150
Yeah.

213
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What number do you give that one in the subjective that can be sort of that emotional distress.

214
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.680
Jackie: My gosh, I'm good at 80

215
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I have it here. It's 70 I'm going to move it up there. It is at, okay, and my seemed like a no duh. But what's the emotion justice that we visited that intensity of at just now right was really a big deal back then that period of time. Dad would take her side, knowing

216
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Your he knows you're telling the truth.

217
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:06.150
Jackie: It was such strong like ridiculous frustration. It was pretty, pretty much turned into anger at that point, like just frustration overgrown

218
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the belief about yourself back then.

219
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Go slow, don't rush it. No apology needed. These are hard to find. Just let it, let it find its way so visit anger.

220
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing him listening to him.

221
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the opposite.

222
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens the opposite of your reality.

223
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's even the opposite of his reality, but he's saying something else.

224
00:22:51.180 --> 00:23:01.140
Jackie: And never going to be understood in that comes into mind yeah is never going to come out or she's always going to be protected. That's more darn me so, nevermind.

225
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is an important thought, though, I'm never going to be understood and she's always going to be protected.

226
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's being protected. That's important. I want to hear that.

227
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, yeah.

228
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.870
Jackie: To this day is still like that to this day. This day huh

229
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome.

230
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes me want to pull out all my baby pictures.

231
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.010
Oh,

232
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.860
Jackie: See that scares me so scary.

233
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Having them grow.

234
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.240
Jackie: Yes. Yeah, it's weird. I can't picture them being like men. It's weird.

235
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes, nice and slow, it'll

236
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll take on all the sudden you'll be

237
00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Like bone structure. What is that like the face is like it's not doesn't have

238
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:03.900
A

239
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: baby. The baby fat and who Chunky Monkey.

240
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, no, it's just a different love. It's the same, same thing.

241
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.070
Jackie: You're just a little bigger.

242
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's just and they're, they're more to hug.

243
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.490
Jackie: So strange

244
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wouldn't have been able to tell you that if it wasn't true. I was exactly where you're at, like, how can that be. I like the cutie pie, miss.

245
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.840
Mm hmm.

246
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All the stages are amazing.

247
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.790
All right, we got here. I never going to be understood.

248
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that today.

249
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.030
Jackie: This is not so much is true, but that's because I feel, I feel like I can explain myself and stand up for myself a little more than I used to be able to

250
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:17.040
Jackie: And I mean the people that I deal with are so different from my parents. So they at least most of the time are willing to listen a little better than they are. So it's not as true. I mean, I feel like I misunderstood a lot, but I'm able to explain that to people.

251
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Me ask you when you're explaining yourself. This is really subtle.

252
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're explaining explaining explaining. Imagine the persons that list is listening.

253
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Only says back. Basically what you're saying. They just merit, back to you. Would that be enough for you to feel understood

254
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:51.840
Jackie: I like to hear people like explain what I'm saying in their own words to me. That's reassuring that they understand me. Yep.

255
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back.

256
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel I'm misunderstood.

257
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, not that one. I am never going to be understood that one. Give me a number, from what is, what is this one. This one's the

258
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: One. That's the one to seven. So how true is that today. Just give me a number one to seven seven is it's totally true. I'm never going to be understood how true is that

259
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.090
Three.

260
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And the positive belief. Yes, sort of the, the opposite, like what you want to believe what, what would you like to, to believe. What's the positive cognition.

261
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.550
Jackie: Oh, sorry.

262
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see God.

263
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.040
Jackie: Is a piece of tape on his face, and he's

264
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Dancing and he looks like. What's he got he's got a special little tongue there.

265
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

266
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

267
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.110
Jackie: Okay, good. Thank you.

268
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.660
Jackie: Okay. I'll be right there.

269
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.300
Jackie: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question.

270
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't remember. Oh, positive cognition, thinking about what you want to be thinking. So if right it's not

271
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never be understood.

272
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The one you want to be thinking as what

273
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go back to it might because you're with your kids. So just see if you can go back to that discomfort. In fact, it was ridiculous frustration and anger, actually. So just picture.

274
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.910
Jackie: I like to have

275
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that what I would have liked to have believed at the time because you're you can picture you can see see your dad doing what he needs to be doing what he's doing your mom's doing

276
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: what she's doing. And you're ridiculously frustrated and angry. What do you, what do you kind of wish your belief about yourself back then was

277
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.810
Jackie: I'm heard

278
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:23.610
Yeah.

279
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it today.

280
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That one is one to 10 How true is it unheard.

281
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.950
Jackie: 6.5

282
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To two day 6.5

283
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.550
Okay.

284
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.360
Jackie: Give me tissue for you. Okay. Me too.

285
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.290
Jackie: I'm so sorry. Those bad

286
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.050
Jackie: Why we keep coming in and out. I'm sorry.

287
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, they're probably going to continue to do so. So I assume you're you're sorry for it but just remember I'm. This isn't my treatment. This is yours.

288
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.320
Jackie: So, exactly. Don't worry about that.

289
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Not on my anyway.

290
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's go to

291
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I am heard

292
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:11.970
Jackie: Yes.

293
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.070
Jackie: Sort of

294
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: See why it's not a solid seven or a solid eight just see what gets in the way of that.

295
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:31.500
Jackie: I think because I still have to ask for validation, like, especially with my husband. I'm like, Do you get what I'm saying. I'm like,

296
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:41.010
Jackie: In your own words like what am I saying, I have to say that a lot. And then most of the time, he doesn't really get it to the point where I wish he would get it so

297
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.000
Jackie: I see. Yep.

298
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.350
Doesn't get it.

299
00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you think you might feel meaning emotion. If you really got you.

300
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.310
Jackie: Piece

301
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it oftentimes that you want him to

302
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Validate you

303
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But really, that's enough, you don't actually need him to go change something, it's just please say say that say it back using your own context and experience.

304
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just that doesn't, you don't really

305
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not looking for him to go, you know, clean out the garage and, you know, you just want to be able to explain how important a clean garages.

306
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:55.710
Jackie: Exactly. Or like I explained, like why clean is so important to me. Maybe you don't even go do it in the next week. But tell me that like you understand why I like clean

307
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:04.320
Jackie: Then I mean at least that way. I'm thinking in my head. Okay. At least he understands and that's like in his mind somewhere that he knows it's important, and why

308
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.610
Jackie: Not that I'm just, you know, nagging him to go do something. There's a reason behind it.

309
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.810
Do you remember

310
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever

311
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you caught yourself doing that.

312
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And

313
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave it to yourself instead

314
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.620
Jackie: The validation

315
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.340
Uh huh.

316
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:07.830
Jackie: I think recently I my own validation has been enough to kind of fulfill that recently, especially I've never used to be able to do that kind of thing.

317
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.380
Jackie: And it makes me feel a lot

318
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:17.580
Jackie: Better, but at the same time it's missing that like my husband, especially doesn't really get it. I just feel like it's important

319
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.100
Jackie: Here, look.

320
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.450
Jackie: Oh yeah, I'm sorry for saying that. Okay.

321
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Good luck with that.

322
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry.

323
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I already hacked away at that one.

324
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.190
Jackie: I'm

325
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: On a back off for a while.

326
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.860
Okay.

327
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I like this. I like where you're going with this. So let's go between let's go in between those two get one of those images. You just had

328
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know recently I've been validating so something you pictured something right so just go with that. Just hold on to it for a moment in your in your mind.

329
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And

330
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Something was still missing and you're telling me it's important that this other person know my motivation and my intent.

331
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.390
Jackie: Right. Mm hmm.

332
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is piece missing.

333
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If not, what's missing because pieces almost

334
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well okay pieces not there. If pieces. This space between other my object husband used to be apparent.

335
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Pieces in here, what's here while I'm taking care of myself not demanding that the other object. Give it to me.

336
00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What's missing.

337
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:15.930
Jackie: Wholeheartedly. It's peace. I say that so much when I'm like even frustrated or overwhelmed and like I just want peace. I just want to like be at peace and be like, just at a comfortable state. I don't even know how to explain it. Peace.

338
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the opposite of peace first word.

339
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:26.790
Jackie: Disrupt

340
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.200
Jackie: I don't know if that's accurate because then I feel like sadness to and frustration. Okay.

341
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.630
Sadness frustration.

342
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds very similar to that general period of time, and it was a long, you know, long history of disruption sadness frustration that was a long period.

343
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.630
Okay.

344
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Why have you decided to do the self validation more often recently.

345
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:24.270
Jackie: It's a tool that I've always had that I guess and never notice actually changed the way I felt even a little bit so

346
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:32.880
Jackie: I guess in my head self validation is better than no validation, because then I know my truth. And I know my intent.

347
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:45.750
Jackie: I know I'm not trying to nag anybody or just upset anybody. And even if they don't get it. I know it's true about me. So maybe one day that truth will come through, because if it's truth, it's always going to be there. It's relentless relentless truth.

348
00:35:52.860 --> 00:36:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen if your husband doesn't understand you.

349
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.840
Jackie: That's a big fear mine.

350
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now to realize it. Just try to catch the first imagery that first response. I know it's a fear.

351
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen.

352
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If he doesn't understand you.

353
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.220
Jackie: Struggling forever.

354
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And that of course is

355
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not peace. That's the absence of peace.

356
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.870
Jackie: Yep, exactly. Yeah.

357
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: In tangible terms.

358
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So patient, whatever that little image, you had right self validated that's

359
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just least I can do that.

360
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: He still doesn't understand

361
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There's not peace.

362
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Play that forward.

363
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what is this relationship going to look like. What's your happiness going to look like. How's the functioning of the family, how, what's the, the ultimate fear that's going to happen.

364
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:39.090
Jackie: That I'm gonna have to let things go and forget them and act like they're no big deal when they really are to me and just let them slide to

365
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:46.440
Jackie: Ensure that there's no like bumps in the road and that everything's functioning. Okay, I just been forever. I'm going to have to betray myself, I guess.

366
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.120
Jackie: Yeah.

367
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your

368
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Husband capable of, let's say,

369
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: In my terms, it was be. Does your husband have the ego strength to show

370
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Empathy and validation, which means

371
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: He can say back in his own words, his own experience of you knowing, given your childhood. How important, you know, using his own awareness of you.

372
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your beliefs.

373
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Can he do it. Does he have the ego strength to do it.

374
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:51.210
Jackie: If he's not frustrated and like all worked up. Yes, but most the time, I have to prompt him so like, what do you do it unprompted, not really, but I mean if I asked him, and I'm like, Can you tell me why this bugs me or something then he'd be like, then he repeat it back.

375
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:59.400
Jackie: Or like, I'm like, do you know why this bugs me. Can you tell me why this is so irritating to me. I say that a lot and like reiterate it

376
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how often does that pattern right there happens

377
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.890
Jackie: Every other day maybe

378
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example over content like an actual, like I need to know. Or I want to know. Anyway over

379
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I got a really every other day I got a great number

380
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not looking. I'm actually looking for content now.

381
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.580
Jackie: Like about what

382
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Making the bed is content right let me. Can I hear what it's over.

383
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:39.780
Jackie: Yeah, this could be over anything about like why I don't want some of his family around our kids.

384
00:39:41.190 --> 00:40:00.420
Jackie: Why, why I don't want him to stay an extra hour late at work. If he doesn't have to. Why like clean cleaning is a huge one. I don't know why I want him to clean or why it bugs me when he saw like short and rough like with the kids like if he's frustrated or tired.

385
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.950
Jackie: That's a few. I mean, that's, that's great.

386
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are great examples of

387
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.290
Jackie: Those are the big ones.

388
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now remember earlier I asked you, is it enough that he just say, I understand.

389
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said yes.

390
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.760
Jackie: He just said the words I understand know

391
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.410
Jackie: The philosophy. Okay.

392
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it because earlier you said yes it's enough that he validates me because I asked you that what you didn't say was no I needed to go change it. You didn't say that.

393
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was checking in on I'm

394
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: On ask it again.

395
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it enough.

396
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:58.440
Jackie: There's certain things like listing those situations. There's certain things where it's probably not because

397
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:06.660
Jackie: He's like, I'm sorry person. He's like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but then I'm like, well, to be sorry. You got to try to, like, change your behavior to not do it again.

398
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:19.140
Jackie: So like that gets frustrating because he can be sorry a million times over one thing. And I'm like, we wouldn't have to be sorry if you would just try to like not do it. So sometimes I wish you would change things. Yeah.

399
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We're already getting can't believe it's almost the top of the hour and

400
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you deliver that behavior request.

401
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:42.180
Jackie: I say a flat out. I'm like, I'm so sick of sorry like you don't like I'm so tired of. Sorry, just don't do it. Just don't do it. And you don't have to be sorry. And we don't have to go through this

402
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What does he say

403
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:45.690
Jackie: I know

404
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:54.540
Jackie: What does he say he's like, I know I sorry doesn't mean anything anymore. I really I he always says, Oh, I'm really going to work on it. I'm really going to try not to.

405
00:41:55.770 --> 00:42:01.080
Jackie: And then maybe like for movies will be really good. But then it goes back to like not happening at all anymore.

406
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.260
Jackie: And I'm like, Oh, why can't you just be consistent, your debut.

407
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And his storyline his history doesn't have

408
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't naturally reinforce these values that you have it.

409
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just has it. He has a different story.

410
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, his family.

411
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:46.410
Jackie: Mm hmm. Definitely. He says all the time. Oh, I'm not used to doing this because I had to explain like empathy to him a long time ago. And he's like, empathy doesn't come naturally to me like

412
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:52.680
Jackie: I'm not the type of person who's good at doing that. Like I'm but I but I'm working on it for you. He says all the time. So,

413
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.810
Jackie: He says he had to turn that off when he was younger. A lot of the time.

414
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:00.720
Jackie: Don't step on it.

415
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.000
Jackie: Let me

416
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.270
Jackie: Right here.

417
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. I think we've got some interesting information that I think later on we might be able to sort of do some of those experiential exercises together.

418
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

419
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But check in with you. See, see if you notice anything important that came up for you.

420
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:42.120
Jackie: These are things that I don't really let anybody know that, like, I don't really talk about a lot. So, but the only person on earth who probably knows about these things right now. So that's a lot, I guess.

421
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I just am so privileged. Thank you for that. For that trust. I'll be I'll be careful with it.

422
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.380
Be careful with it.

423
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.540
Jackie: Thank you.

424
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. What do you need from me. Do you need a message to a doctor for medication. Should we reschedule an appointment.

425
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:11.310
Jackie: I don't even see me in regards to medication but yeah let's reschedule something. Okay.

426
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, looking for a pencil.

Jackie: Is it next Friday. Uh huh. Okay.

431
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have a pretty darn consistent theme.

432
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.420
Jackie: What

433
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's around that event it's around that that invalidating crazy making family environment. It's just, it's there. And then it's there. And then it's there. And then it's there. So,

434
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important.

435
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.780
Jackie: really messed me up. It

436
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It would, it would make anyone cuckoo.

437
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm

438
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm so impressed and how functional right because you could have really

439
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:26.040
Jackie: I say that all the time. I could have ended up just like my mom. But then I use. I think that just the frustration and like how much I just liked it. I'm like, I can't be like that. I can't, I can't be like a replication of that I can't I just can't.

440
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's there some some rebellion inside of you. Some tenaciousness some defiance. That will not yield. It knows itself. And that's, that's, that is beautiful. And we're going to be able to capitalize on that. Okay.

441
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.140
Jackie: I'm excited. Yeah.

442
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.810

Gwenevere Abriel: We've got some new group members in there. It's getting really

451
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.190
Jackie: Yesterday it was

Gwenevere Abriel: The doctor and I are like we need to grow. We got

454
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And all of a sudden, all these clients signed up for the program. I'm like,

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: 11 o'clock. It's going to be awesome.

456
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, and some, some people that haven't been there in the wild, are going to be surprised, too. So I'm glad you're part of that one.

457
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for

Nicole Roybal: How are you

466
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent years giving me a hard time today, but other than that.

467
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm starting today off with

468
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Opening up the discussion.

469
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: coronavirus Well hi everybody. I'm like, You know what, I might as well. Bring it up first, because it's on everybody's mind. So how much is it affecting you.

470
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.150
Nicole Roybal: I'm scared shirtless

471
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're scared. Tell me the thought. Let me, let me hear

472
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.600
Nicole Roybal: What just like because it's such a pandemic. I was calling it an epidemic with a pandemic. I didn't know the difference of that until the other day.

473
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.890
Nicole Roybal: But I'm honestly just like scared because like

474
00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.420
Nicole Roybal: If they've been closed down schools they close down the

475
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.720
Nicole Roybal: Sports equals gentle sports like that. It's that serious. I didn't even know the swine flu.

476
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:21.540
Nicole Roybal: So I'm just honest, I'm just like, really scared been washing my hands constantly and then plus take care of my grandparents, I'm afraid, because I'm out in the world all the time. They're just in their house. So they're fine but me going over there. What if I give it to them. Yeah.

477
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I wondered if you were concerned about your grandparents on this.

478
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:30.960
Nicole Roybal: This. Yeah, actually, because it's the elderly and the babies that are the most vulnerable to it right now.

479
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.030
Nicole Roybal: Right.

480
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.060
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, honestly, my heart started pounding just even just talking about it, like, here's the crap out of me.

481
00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are some things. So we've got the hand washing

482
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And we know that it's sort of stays dormant somewhere between five and 14 days sort of sits in there.

483
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:57.720
Nicole Roybal: Whoa, that's crazy like someone touches a handle. And then you just can't handle it. You can say that for 12 days 14 days. Yeah.

484
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.690
Nicole Roybal: Since seem like oh

485
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.990
Nicole Roybal: It's like a sandal world. Yeah.

486
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It. But on the flip side of that, um, people have gotten it you know that are your age and

487
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.770
Probably my age. I'm assuming

488
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't done a lot of research into it. That's certainly on my my agenda to get more informed.

489
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And very and they were fine.

490
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:36.690
Nicole Roybal: I mean, I know they said if you get it between ages like 12 to 20 something or, I don't know, I can't remember exact numbers, but that your body will just pass it like a common cold.

491
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:39.870
Nicole Roybal: Am I within that age range.

492
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You are, you are your, your, and it's also a motivator to eat healthy.

493
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep.

494
00:49:53.070 --> 00:50:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have non toxic people around do write it, what it does is it highlights. We have a vulnerable immune system.

495
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We're more vulnerable right to those Taran agents to those well strategy and is a word that encompasses a lot of things that are toxic to the body. Oh.

496
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Fancy word. I like it.

497
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.700
Nicole Roybal: And I never heard that one before.

498
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, well, I'm gonna use that one.

499
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: More

500
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.720
Nicole Roybal: Time, which I use big words, he doesn't understand he just like this.

501
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.110
Nicole Roybal: Um, but, no, I

502
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:35.220
Nicole Roybal: Was I gonna say I'm my immune system is really weak too because I've been puking and I don't know why.

503
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:49.470
Nicole Roybal: And I haven't been donating Evan doing it in a few weeks. And I just thought of that. That's the one thing that's changed my life. And every time I don't donate. I do like always feel like kind of sick because all the white blood cells are staying instead of leaving

504
00:50:51.180 --> 00:51:07.050
Nicole Roybal: So I don't know because I went over like six years now, maybe more, and I donated pretty confidently and now that I haven't done in a few weeks. Seven. Take care, my grandma. I haven't had time I'd realized that when I started getting sick when I stopped donating

505
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:08.940
But

506
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um, you may want to talk to to your doctor about that. Dr. Raphael, because what you just said sounds. It's not based in in really this beautiful mechanism. These white blood cells. The they go around and they make sure they're taking care of healing so

507
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:39.930
Nicole Roybal: YEAH, WELL, UM, WELL, I HAD. Okay, so when I first started donating. I started donating because I went to the doctor and he said my white blood cell count was really high.

508
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:51.030
Nicole Roybal: And that can be bad. And so he actually recommended donating plasma and I guess. Yeah. And I guess it levels, my white blood cells out. I don't know.

509
00:51:52.860 --> 00:52:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What it is so high, white blood cell count may indicate that the immune system is working to destroy an infection. Right. So there's an infection. Interesting.

510
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:10.050
Nicole Roybal: That was like I said I was like six years ago and I just kept donating because he said it would keep me and I white blood cells at a good level.

511
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.400
Nicole Roybal: Don't know.

512
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: III, just the approach doesn't

513
00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so listen. I love the stuttering.

514
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I don't I don't live very well and

515
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

516
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wanting to try

517
00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So a high white blood cell count may indicate that the immune system is working to destroy an infection, when you see them there, that's a sign that the body's trying to solve a problem. It's a real strong sign

518
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:47.040
Nicole Roybal: Hmm.

519
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Its job is to go in those around.

520
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And fix their little healers those little

521
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.400
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, fight the bad guys.

522
00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I love the visual all grown up with that visual

523
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:01.380
Nicole Roybal: It also

524
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It also may be a sign.

525
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Of physical or emotional stress.

526
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.220
Nicole Roybal: Huh. Hmm.

527
00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:13.380
Nicole Roybal: So that's where I met Dr. Kind of. He was like a doctor, he was even like trying to, like, just like

528
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:25.290
Nicole Roybal: Give me any pills like he's like well what do you want like just tell me what you want. And I'll write it down like basically and like I told him I was like, I want to think opiates. I've had issues with that. And he's the one that gave me a

529
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:36.930
Nicole Roybal: What does that really strong ibuprofen. He total lack total life and I had asked Dr opera house she could prescribe it to me. It's, I like it because it's a really good pain reliever.

530
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:42.120
Nicole Roybal: She's like, no, I'm supposed to prescribe you more than like two, three days of that and he gave me 30 days worth

531
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you just you just discredited that reporter all together. Right.

532
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:54.060
Nicole Roybal: You just say, Yeah, exactly. So I don't know my doctor was a good doctor. He was just someone that just feeds people pills.

533
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to which reminds me that you

534
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a primary care physician appointment. Right.

535
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.650
Nicole Roybal: Yes, I

536
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what's going to be included in that discussion.

537
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:10.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly.

538
00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing you're talking about right now.

539
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Throwing up is like a real sign something right

540
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:27.330
Nicole Roybal: I know. And then I got a pregnancy test. To be sure, if I just check. Yeah. And freakin I guess it was too cheap because it literally had an option. If it comes out invalid.

541
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it was invalid.

542
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:37.560
Nicole Roybal: And I did it. And it had like a dropper you actually painted cup and drop it in the house. The house is weird. And it didn't work. So I'm gonna go get another one today and

543
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.320
Nicole Roybal: Again, the morning kind of skews most

544
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And. But again, you might say to the physician. Listen, this is my history. I've got some current presenting problems that really may need more testing on it. Tell you what they are.

545
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's get started on this. One of them is this I'm rolling out pregnancy. Can you do a pregnancy test. Check my urine. Let's see.

546
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And this white blood cell count is maybe something relevant to it. Maybe my body's been trying to fight off and affection. If that's the case, I want to know what it's up to. Also, I highly recommend you talk about the the alcohol and say this

547
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.070
Nicole Roybal: Is a

548
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Huge change for me. I have. I'm also in MIT program.

549
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know tell tell this person I, you know, whatever. The truth is I don't know what it is, hey, I've been stable at this dose.

550
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had this many weeks of vomiting, and this is the time of day, that it happens.

551
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, really explain what's going on so that they know what kind of testing to do

552
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.250
Nicole Roybal: You said em at program so

Nicole Roybal: Two three hundreds in the morning so 600 in the morning and then in the middle of the day I was taking one 302 106 I was thinking, okay, that's 500 and it's going to be 1500 and then I was taking another three 600 at night. So the two 300 so I was taking 1700 thinking it was 15

575
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:52.140
Nicole Roybal: Oh yeah cuz I'm an idiot. So sinking the 500 in the middle of the day is 500 and I told I told Dr. Aubrey other day low and I am I went down to 1600 on Monday.

582
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.100
Nicole Roybal: Wait, I'm sorry, repeat that I'm confused.

583
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.170

586
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And then I put two times 100

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:47.190
Nicole Roybal: Now, should be 300 at night, two times 300 600

589
00:58:49.050 --> 00:59:04.080
Nicole Roybal: So like, you're right. I shouldn't be taking only 300 in the middle of the day but stupidly I was taking two extra 100 with it sells against that would make it 1500. I don't know why it was thinking, it'd be 1000

590
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It can you

591
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you just

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Grab a piece of paper.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.030
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I have to

594
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Write down

Gwenevere Abriel: Two times 300 equals 600

596
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:17.970
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

597
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then under that put one times 300 equals 300

598
00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then two times 300 equals 600

599
00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:31.830
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

600
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.540
Nicole Roybal: And then add up.

601
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, slow down. Add up 600 plus 300 plus 600

602
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:51.330
Nicole Roybal: Can I know I figured that out. I figured out. Okay, just take one 300 and the middle of the day. I know I

603
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I don't understand.

604
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you're giving yourself a hard time about it. But it sounds like you've been taking 1500

605
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:14.430
Nicole Roybal: Know, cuz ok so the one in the middle of the day I was taking an extra 100 pills. I have the 100 milligrams. I was taking two 100 milligrams with the 300 and the middle of the day, two times 100

606
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another that you are taking 1700

607
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.320
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly.

608
01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what

609
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:28.830
Nicole Roybal: This week I went down to 1600 because I was so mad. I was like, you know, I was supposed to be at 15 almost 14 now.

610
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.840
Nicole Roybal: Okay. And so I'm

611
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:35.490
Nicole Roybal: Down to 16 and soon as I found out I was doing it wrong.

612
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:37.830
Accidentally

613
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.420
Was taking 1700

614
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:50.850
Nicole Roybal: Dr eyebrows. Like, I know I understand math. Should I can't go a week without messing up someone's prescription because

615
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:58.560
Nicole Roybal: I'm like, I know, but it's my own fault and I'm still mad at myself and she's like, well, you didn't do it on purpose. And I was like, No, of course not.

616
01:00:59.040 --> 01:00:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then started looking

617
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.110
Nicole Roybal: At yourself.

618
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And starting to take 1500 dollars of when

619
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.560

Nicole Roybal: With. Yeah. Yeah. On Monday, I'll start taking 1500

621
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're going slower than that, when are you starting to take 16 I

622
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.700
Nicole Roybal: Took 16 I've been taking 1600 dollars.

623
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Taking 1600 between three guests 9392 313

624
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, very good. Okay.

625
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it doesn't surprise me these this is a, you know, we knew that was going to happen with those hundreds, we couldn't quite get get the whole thing figured out anyway alright so

626
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell it how much leverage that mistake has over you. I mean,

627
01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:10.260
Nicole Roybal: Like it on through really upset me because I'm usually really good with numbers and the fact that I wasn't this time i get i don't know why, like it's been like eating at me like I'm so mad at myself for doing that.

628
01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:15.060
Nicole Roybal: I don't know why I don't know why I'm so angry, like how could you be so stupid.

629
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.700
But

630
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.510
Nicole Roybal: Okay. Yeah, I know. I'm just, I'm beating my I do that I beat myself up over everything I do.

631
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you do with other people in here.

632
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We slow way down.

633
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.230
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

634
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's not quite the same where we say, oh, well, I'm just stupid. And I do that all the time. And here we say, wait a minute.

635
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why I do that instead of what's going on, what what distractions were going on. What am I

636
01:02:53.310 --> 01:03:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Focused on instead of slowly double checking or or putting out the the medication, you know, in a container and having it already in little Ziploc bags or something. What

637
01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder what's going on that I'm not doing those things. Instead, what you do is what you always did. And that is, I'm stupid.

638
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:19.980
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

639
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what you've done in the past.

640
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Who thinks you're stupid besides you. Does anyone else think you're stupid.

641
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:39.030
Nicole Roybal: Whereas this stupid. I just like

642
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:49.050
Nicole Roybal: I don't know why, like when it comes to like anyone in my life. I always feel like I'm doing something wrong or like, oh, they're thinking this is me, or like I gotta like

643
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.930
Nicole Roybal: I don't I don't explain that like

644
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.710
Nicole Roybal: One example I can think of at the moment, not the best example.

645
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

646
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:07.170
Nicole Roybal: But I'm like, my god. He's so sweet with me and he'll smoke with me, but I don't ever he said what he said he says one hand washes the other, and I don't ever like kind of pay him back with my own weed smoke with him.

647
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:20.550
Nicole Roybal: And I always just like people are thinking like, oh, like bad of me like as if like I'm doing something wrong or there we seem like the little things I do wrong or I'm not helping them out as much as they helped me out, or just who I'm getting so emotional

648
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:22.560
Nicole Roybal: Just like

649
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:23.490
OK.

650
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just stay there.

651
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead just brief let's hop, hop away. There we go.

652
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll read with you.

653
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just lean in, instead, let's see what those tears have to say.

654
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.450
Nicole Roybal: Like everyone always expects more out of me and I'm not doing enough

655
01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:59.280
Nicole Roybal: My sister is telling me she's like, I don't know why you think that like no one thinks that they're like why I feel like they do.

656
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:03.690
Nicole Roybal: Do that.

657
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:05.430
Okay.

658
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.250
Nicole Roybal: Had to, like, kind of like just say that and let it out. Yes.

659
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:12.240
That's right.

660
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if your dad.

661
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:22.860
Nicole Roybal: My he doesn't say that he doesn't feel that way. I even asked him last night. Like, I don't feel that way you don't have to, like, you're fine.

662
01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:24.240
So,

663
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You checked it out. I asked them.

664
01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you believe them.

665
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

666
01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:37.950
Nicole Roybal: We still feel that way. So it's, you know,

667
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.630
Nicole Roybal: It's like I always just like, oh, something to everybody in my life like

668
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:53.820
Nicole Roybal: I'm never doing enough always keep trying. Always got to keep doing for them is not, then we might not like me.

669
01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Notice how. Notice how upset you are. Yes, that's it. You just found it. Oh, goodness. Oh, that's just

670
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:06.930
Nicole Roybal: Always hold my throat.

671
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

672
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: They won't like me and is it also that might mean

673
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:17.160
Nicole Roybal: They don't love me.

674
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't love me and I'll be

675
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:21.000
Nicole Roybal: Alone alone.

676
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.740
That's abandonment.

677
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I and this is our theme. This is the same.

678
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is

679
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.920
Nicole Roybal: Not that just because like

680
01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:44.250
Nicole Roybal: I don't know if has anything to do with that. But like, I'm the middle child like literally smack dab in the middle. And so I've always felt like on the middle kid they've never really cared. And like I was only one might hit when I was a kid I

681
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.500
Nicole Roybal: And then I'm gonna want to graduate high school. Come on, let's

682
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, don't go there. Don't go there state come

683
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:58.830
Nicole Roybal: Back, back about that. I think I just because I was only one who do that too. I think it just made me feel more

684
01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.680
Nicole Roybal: Less of myself.

685
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:03.960
Nicole Roybal: And I mean,

686
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's do some work around right

687
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.560
Nicole Roybal: Right in here right in here.

688
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go instead

689
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: To the anchor room today.

690
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.750
Okay.

691
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.420
You just see how far you got in here if you were able to play.

692
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.140
Nicole Roybal: Okay. Oh, and I did answer that question.

693
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

694
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:40.230
Nicole Roybal: Why do I keep having these thoughts of, like, cuz we're talking about when I get off the bus, and when I get to the side of town and everything.

695
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:47.310
Nicole Roybal: And so what I wrote down. I don't know if it kind of goes with it, but only wrote was okay. So I put

696
01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:58.230
Nicole Roybal: Like when I got the bus. I'm human. I'm not going to just be able to totally stopped away to the trash like I'm human, and I need to remember that my brain has thought one way for a long time.

697
01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:07.230
Nicole Roybal: And I need to cut myself some slack because I'm not a super human I have feelings and problem just like everyone else. And I didn't remember that.

698
01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:22.890
Nicole Roybal: And you put those thoughts on the side of the road and pass right by it and just hold on to my truth, and remember that I'm better than this. And I could push past like I just don't think about it like just try to like I said pacified on the road and just keep going.

699
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.100
Nicole Roybal: Please give you that.

700
01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And have you been able to use that imagery

701
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:31.740
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, actually a lot

702
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:47.520
Nicole Roybal: It's insane. Like it's weird, like I've used them. It doesn't seem like works every time. But when I do, actually really focus on it and just try to actually like just go inward like you tell me it's really hard for me to go inward. I don't know why I think I just don't like to see myself.

703
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.940
Nicole Roybal: Even though it's not a bad person.

704
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Ministry. The imagery. When I focus on it finished. That's part of the thought.

705
01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The imagery

706
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When I focus on it.

707
01:08:57.570 --> 01:09:07.830
Nicole Roybal: It's, um, it's like I have to like really go inward and like really just kind of like I guess in a way like meditate like I have to sit there and close my eyes and just like how myself like okay

708
01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:15.090
Nicole Roybal: Just picture yourself in the car, like, just like you know really hard, but as long as you push through that like

709
01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.010
Nicole Roybal: Like where you feel stupid for doing it.

710
01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.220
Nicole Roybal: As long as you put past that.

711
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.460
Nicole Roybal: Then it's like, Okay, do this, and then it becomes more like vivid

712
01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.230
Nicole Roybal: In a way.

713
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.040
Uh huh.

714
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you want a way to persuade yourself around the stupid part

715
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.360
So,

716
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying.

717
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:45.930
Nicole Roybal: No, no. Yeah, you're right.

718
01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:46.440
Me.

719
01:09:47.610 --> 01:09:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you would romanticize and start to project into the future about how great it will feel after you score.

720
01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain was doing something. Anyway, was using imagination to do that. So it's not that ridiculous, we're just putting in place something productive.

721
01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive

722
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If the end result is that you end up feeling at peace and that there's really no problem to solve it. Really, you're okay. In that moment, if we can put together a few of those moments and you have 60 seconds. Five minutes, an hour. It's a win and yeah

723
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is the imagery instead of thing about it is it's okay for you. Instead, you don't think it's ridiculous because you're going to go numb out

724
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Go lay down do nothing. Move nothing forward in your life. But that one's okay because it's familiar to you.

725
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:50.940
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.

726
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

727
01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:53.640
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I get that.

728
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Yes, but you recognize the silliness of it and

729
01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:58.260
Yeah.

730
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:07.560
Nicole Roybal: Like a beta is just like, well, because like you stand outside of the road. So take the bus, you know, your center your eyes close

731
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.040
Nicole Roybal: This crackhead

732
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.860
Nicole Roybal: Just like we go find a bench.

733
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.540
Nicole Roybal: I was able to actually, um,

734
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:29.790
Nicole Roybal: The other day when I came home from my grandma's house. It was kind of, I call them kind of late and I was able to get off the bus and I didn't think about it at all.

735
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:42.690
Nicole Roybal: There's a bus and just walk to whatever because I was just in such a rush to get home. So it's dark and it was it looked like it was going to rain and I mean I mean my brain. Let's just focus on so much other things I didn't think about it.

736
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.380
Nicole Roybal: I was like, you know, when I got home, I was like, yes.

737
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.680
Nicole Roybal: Yes, let's get better.

738
01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.270
Nicole Roybal: I like you, but

739
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:58.830
Nicole Roybal: I just I keep thinking like, oh, it's just going to go away in a day.

740
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.090
Nicole Roybal: And so I was saying and what I said in that sentences. I'm not superhuman. I gotta remember that I'm gonna have these things I'm going to have these thoughts. I can't just delete them and I got to remember that.

741
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:10.830
Nicole Roybal: Nicole.

742
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.020
Nicole Roybal: Nicole.

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:19.980

Nicole Roybal: Okay.

750
01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I'm reluctant to want to move away from some important things that she said no, really want to want to see if we can have a little bit of a little bit of growth around that. Okay.

751
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.660
Nicole Roybal: Which one

752
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:02.250
For me,

753
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to be

754
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Surveying I gotta be constantly vigilant about what I'm supposed to be doing, how I can better. How can I do more be better fix

755
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So that people don't abandon me

756
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.790
Nicole Roybal: And I know you told us. That's not a thing.

757
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't go right

758
01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:33.240
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, but

759
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:38.190
Nicole Roybal: Very cool, is be doing more for people. And I'm not doing

760
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the earliest recollection of someone

761
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Either sending that message to you or you

762
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Absorb that message, regardless of whether they were direct or indirect about it.

763
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.640
Nicole Roybal: I felt like it started once like Daniel with my boyfriend.

764
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:07.500
Nicole Roybal: Because he's always like, like I said, like he's always pushing like oh you're about to be 30 like you need to have your life together. And that's I think that. And then also, like, just like

765
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:15.300
Nicole Roybal: pushed me to be better because he knows that I could be better, but because of Him pushing you to be better made me feel like I have to

766
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:27.750
Nicole Roybal: Always be trying to be like this perfect person for whoever I'm around for their parents with my sister, whether it's Daniel. Well, if anybody. They are always pushing to be better. Okay.

767
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let this process guide. And remember, we're going to slow down a little bit in order to

768
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:33.810
Nicole Roybal: Kind of have

769
01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To change, we can't

770
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Have too much change when we're changing the, the thought so quickly. We kind of need to sit in one one space for a little bit. So let's just sit there

771
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:47.610
Nicole Roybal: For a second, it's hard for me.

772
01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:48.900
Nicole Roybal: I'm

773
01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:56.430

775
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If only I did this, then

776
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it was there in your

Nicole Roybal: Now that I'm awful. I just feel like, okay, when you judge I got through that.

782
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:40.200
Nicole Roybal: I can be so much better than that person. And then when I was drinking. I feel like I'm still like just as valuable person still drinking

783
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.400
Nicole Roybal: When like when I was drinking enough. And so I think because of that. Now I'm just like, Okay, I'm Knievel not drinking

858
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:21.600

Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe.

882
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you had a distraction, maybe while I was saying those things your mind was focused on someone in the room or hearing or I don't know what. But notice what happened. You didn't remember

883
01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:03.090

889
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I was specific

890
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:24.420

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:34.320
Nicole Roybal: My mom is in the kitchen cooking right now and then. My brother was walking through it just, yeah. Large sections. Right, so

894
01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you didn't say to me, hey, Glenn. Let's keep it superficial. I've got people in the room and I don't want to talk about something deep and I don't want to notice how you didn't say anything like that.

895
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.680
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, cuz I don't really I don't really have anything to hide from them.

896
01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.980
Nicole Roybal: But I guess maybe

897
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll. Why wouldn't you want to have privacy. This

898

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just now.

902
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.000
Nicole Roybal: And

903
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:26.760
Nicole Roybal: It's hard for me to. I hate when the last thing you said we can never remember it's like we don't remember it often forget

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll do it again. Forgive me.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had said your own style a wait a minute, or whatever you might have said, this won't be as effective because my family's in the room. What if you said

992
01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Something even close to that. What do you think might happen to my face to my voice to our relationship, what might happen.

993
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:57.510
Nicole Roybal: If you'd like I'm going to turn your eyes beside me rolling a little bit, get a little upset and like walking is there room, you go to where you can be alone know

994
01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.810
Nicole Roybal: Like you get upset about it.

995
01:32:01.230 --> 01:32:07.860
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I do the same thing because there's nowhere to go to be alone. Anyway, besides the bathroom and I'm not about to listen to

996
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hang in there.

997
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:14.910
Nicole Roybal: I know. Sorry. You know me I rap.

998
01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So I might look to the side roll my eyes was a room, you can go to like that.

999
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:30.420
Nicole Roybal: Not exactly that know you'd be more nicer about it.

1000
01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:44.040
Nicole Roybal: Because maybe try to like hide your, your, I will just kind of look to the side. And it's like, well, is there a room maybe go to that we feel alone. It'd be really nice about it but

1001
01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:53.400
Nicole Roybal: I know you'd be upset, deep down, and that's where it gets me is I know deep down. This is how you're feeling, but you're not going to show that because

1002
01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I what do I think of you.

1003
01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:06.960
Nicole Roybal: Responsible not ready, not doing what I'm supposed to be doing to make sure that I am able to do this therapy.

1004
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I say to you, you are waking up from the moment you reach consciousness to the moment that you finally lose consciousness and fall asleep. Those all those seconds and minutes and hours you are working harder than I do.

1005
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Months put together you work harder than I do.

1006
01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:32.580
Nicole Roybal: Knowing

1007
01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:35.970
Nicole Roybal: So many patients and crap. No way.

1008
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:39.030
Nicole Roybal: And Crapper noise.

1009
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you believe me, my right. It's a weird abstract thing. Maybe it's only a day, two days jam together. Maybe it's a month or maybe it's a week, but do you, do you believe that I register that you're working harder than I am.

1010
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.880
Nicole Roybal: I can't say what you believe, because those are your feelings. I can't tell you what you feel.

1011
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go back to it again go back to

1012
01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:20.850
Nicole Roybal: That I I believe that you work way harder. You have so much patience you have so much stuff you do all day long, I think. And I'm not even working on helping my grandma every day. But I think that you work way harder. So that's like, no question about it.

1013
01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I am telling you what I believe. So listen to it.

1014
01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe, from the moment that you reach consciousness. The moment that you fall asleep that you are working incredibly hard for the things that you care about that you have conviction and

1015
01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe it.

1016
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:59.130
Nicole Roybal: Thank you. Appreciate that. And. Exactly. And that's what I try to do too. They try to tell people how they feel, or what they believe, because that's what I believe they believe. And then I'm usually wrong.

1017
01:35:02.190 --> 01:35:04.500
Nicole Roybal: Oh god, I'm trying to please everybody.

1018
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.480
Nicole Roybal: Realized exactly what you said.

1019
01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're starting to understand what's going on here.

1020
01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:17.040
Nicole Roybal: Right now, and I tried to just

1021
01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.060
Nicole Roybal: tell people how they feel like it's in a way, or I just

1022
01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.630
Nicole Roybal: automatically think I know how they feel when they don't

1023
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's why I asked you earlier, I said, is there care. Do I care. Is it a safe enough environment. You said there's right there is some of that. But there was also that you don't believe

1024
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:41.400
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1025
01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.500
Nicole Roybal: Exactly what I believe.

1026
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It is no yeah you said doesn't matter doesn't actually matter what I say to you, you said

1027
01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When basically you're thinking I'm irresponsible.

1028
01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy shit.

1029
01:36:01.110 --> 01:36:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

1030
01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:02.820
Yeah.

1031
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:10.020
Nicole Roybal: And because you're not thinking that I'm just thinking that you're thinking that, but it's not even true

1032
01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at me again is, let's do that one again that one earlier, is there anything about me that you've seen that seems trustworthy where I can be relied upon.

1033
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To say difficult truths to challenge people maybe even it might risk pissing people off offending them or am I so careful that I'm kind of lying to you.

1034
01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:44.190
Nicole Roybal: Know, I don't think so. I don't think that you lie. I think you're pretty straightforward.

1035
01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.280
Nicole Roybal: So she says no, you're gonna say

1036
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a story where you've seen me do it.

1037
01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:56.400
Nicole Roybal: No. Okay. I feel like maybe like

1038
01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:06.390
Nicole Roybal: Not that I can like, just think of off top of my head. I thank you been pretty sincere, he was telling me like you need to do this and you always pushed me and

1039
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:17.880
Nicole Roybal: They forced me, you know, I know for me, but you pushed me in the way that I need to be pushed like forcing the way I need to be forced. You know what I'm trying to say. And so I don't think you've ever been.

1040
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.730
Nicole Roybal: insincere about it. I can feel right word, but

1041
01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.920
Nicole Roybal: I think if I don't, I don't, I can't think of anything where I felt that way.

1042
01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:31.140
Nicole Roybal: But right now back

1043
01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: back here in the back of my mind.

1044
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: She's still irresponsible.

1045
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

1046
01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:46.050
Nicole Roybal: Oh, like, okay, like say like when we hang up and you go and talk to your friends. Oh, this girl at their Machu so

1047
01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.230
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I like every person that's up

1048
01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now I'm thinking, she's irresponsible.

1049
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at me.

1050
01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:00.570
Nicole Roybal: In some ways, yeah. Okay, so I'm

1051
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Here I

1052
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:06.990
Nicole Roybal: Like maybe you do think that like what's the whole medicine thing that wasn't cool. That was very good response, you're

1053
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're making it up.

1054
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.400
Nicole Roybal: I think it's because it's what I believe.

1055
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: asked me a question. I'm right here in front of you. Check it out.

1056
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.160
Nicole Roybal: Like what do you suppose it's what I believe about me.

1057
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: asked me a question, you got it in you. I know you can do it form it in a question when

1058
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:25.620
Nicole Roybal: You

1059
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Think you are

1060
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:31.710
Nicole Roybal: As a

1061
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Person I think you're the cat's meow.

1062
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To

1063
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you were utterly intelligent ambitious.

1064
01:38:43.230 --> 01:39:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your ability to take taken the things that that we talked about in here and you run it through a whole bunch of information you analyze it and you can share it right away, your ability to to process information is actually very fast, you're highly intelligent not

1065
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.180
Nicole Roybal: Not because I process it and then it goes

1066
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.120
Nicole Roybal: It goes right away, cuz I forget it.

1067
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't see it the same way because you did ask me what I think.

1068
01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:16.170
Nicole Roybal: Great.

1069
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

1070
01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Process information very quickly and then you cross the boundary and you start analyzing what I'm thinking. You make up a story about it.

1071
01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And that saps your energy.

1072
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.670
Nicole Roybal: Make sense. Yeah.

1073
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think sometimes you're inaccurate. I think if you were to trust that you're starting to bring people in that are more genuine and more honest, you might be able to just trust that

1074
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When. So, the world will take care of themselves will will be okay well you spend your energy taken your analysis because you're in a in a self growth.

1075
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're in recovery, you're learning new things you're having to do it sober.

1076
01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:16.590
Nicole Roybal: And it

1077
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Was hard

1078
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:23.190
Nicole Roybal: So if capitalizing so much more. Now I'm seeing

1079
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your side of the fence and you don't come over here and you don't have to think for me, all you do is focus just really focus on you.

1080
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're gonna find you kind of like my memory will work better.

1081
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.270
Nicole Roybal: You'll have

1082
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: More efficient storage of information.

1083
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.860
I think

1084
01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit.

1085
01:40:50.940 --> 01:41:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just stay on your side and trust that I will speak up, I will take care of myself. You don't have to take care of me.

1086
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.920
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, okay.

1087
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:09.030
Nicole Roybal: So get away. Same towards you. Bye. Take care of everyone else Romulans.

1088
01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole a therapeutic relationship is

1089
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A great place to work out those more important relationships in here. It's a reenactment more transference. If you're afraid. Ian sort of philosophy here.

1090
01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The same things that happen out there and your real world happened here on probably a much smaller scale.

1091
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:33.750
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so

1092
01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But you work it out here your confidence level your ability to really get what I'm talking about will be rehearsed and practiced and easier to get to. When you use those same skills out there.

1093
01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:48.360
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I'm excited.

1094
01:41:49.020 --> 01:42:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So just really sit with what we did today you sat and you moved through the discomfort of risking confrontation abandonment judgment you risked a lot and you sat here. You did it.

1095
01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:06.150
In real time.

1096
01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And for brief periods of time, there was no discharge. There was no nervous giggle. There was just you stay here.

1097
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

1098
01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.660
Nicole Roybal: Nervous giggles gone

1099
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But it actually takes engaging or you're not looking away and you're not doing these when you're here and you're actually in tune with someone. Yeah, okay.

1100
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.340
Nicole Roybal: That makes sense. Alright.

1101
01:42:44.370 --> 01:42:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's

1102
01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:46.650
Nicole Roybal: Make sure I'm alone next time.

1103
01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're funny.

1104
01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Schedule another appointment.

1105
01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:56.610
Nicole Roybal: Friday. Next, right. So we'll see what you have, nevermind. Sorry.

1106
01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's fine. We can do 10 o'clock. Again, if you like.

1107
01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:04.740
Nicole Roybal: That works perfect

1108
01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, is there a bridge of medication or you're good to go tell your next group.

1109
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:12.030
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm good to group.

1110
01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure you tell me, because this is your moment I may not answer texts or anything later. So this is

Trevor Burger: I got it whenever I had surgery on my elbow. The Lady in the office. I did all my paperwork. She had it so she told me I could keep it from my three years ago.

1123
01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: When you imagine me and you're taking notes with that. How are you feeling today.

1124
01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:30.180
Trevor Burger: Well, I wanted to be. I really wanted to go to school to be a nurse or a phlebotomist or something. So like it always really interested me

1125
01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:47.760
Trevor Burger: And I'm, I mean, I still if I, if the opportunity comes for me to financially, be able to start going to school and instead of working out much love to do that. And me and my mom had been talking about it and my grandpa thinks gonna try to help me so

1126
01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:51.930
Trevor Burger: I just haven't had enough belief in myself to

1127
01:44:53.100 --> 01:45:02.640
Trevor Burger: Believe that I could you know pass all the tests and study and all that, but I haven't. I said, Okay, I've been asking now. So I've been asking for help.

1128
01:45:04.230 --> 01:45:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's so exciting. Yeah, I haven't heard about that, like that is just new information.

1129
01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

1130
01:45:11.850 --> 01:45:13.860
Trevor Burger: I've always loved medical people

1131
01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:23.760
Trevor Burger: Just because I've been in the hospital so much from surgeries and racing it, I got it just grew. I've always wanted to be a nurse or a phlebotomist where they take blood or x ray tech

1132
01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Me now you have been your mom sent me a little thing makes me

1133
01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.300
Trevor Burger: Yes, Sunday night we went to Celebrate Recovery. I met Chris

1134
01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:42.630
Trevor Burger: Yeah so. Celebrate Recovery was really cool like

1135
01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:51.960
Trevor Burger: How they do it is they have like praise and worship or whatever. And then they have a sermon one week and then the next week. They have a testimony from someone

1136
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.760
Trevor Burger: And it goes back to every other week. And then after that's over. You go back into the groups and it's like a a group, basically, but

1137
01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:12.960
Trevor Burger: They, uh, so, but I didn't like Chris, I just a little too. He's just, I liked him, and he's, you know, he said he'd been through the stuff I've been through, but he's just a little too clean cover me. I can't

1138
01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:28.230
Trevor Burger: Call him and be like, hey, man, I'm about to fucking lose it. Like that's not someone I could call and say that you know what I mean. Yeah, and him understand what I'm saying. He's one of the type of people that would be like okay well you just need to pray it away.

1139
01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.390
Trevor Burger: I was like, no, I'm sorry bro

1140
01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.180
Trevor Burger: Man.

1141
01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but let me tell you.

1142
01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:37.110
Trevor Burger: There is another guy, the guy that spoke that night, the

1143
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.040
Trevor Burger: Meeting that I'm supposed to be meeting tonight at church. What's his name.

1144
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:50.910
Trevor Burger: I did. I didn't get his name. He just did the sermon. But the reason that stood out to me him stood out to me is because he gave kind of like

1145
01:46:52.320 --> 01:47:06.240
Trevor Burger: A breakdown of the, how does the steps relate to the Bible and discern. But he, the way he was talking and the way his experience was. That's what I connected to, not the other. But, and I introduced myself to him. I can't remember his name.

1146
01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Was he the testimony guy.

1147
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:14.550
Trevor Burger: Well, this week. It was like the teaching, but he was the one that was teaching. Okay, so look

1148
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Up for now until we get a name. And you can always have a pseudo name if he doesn't want to have wants to remain anonymous. But just for our communication. I'm going to be calling him teaching guy for now.

1149
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:27.300
Trevor Burger: That's fine, because I don't remember his name.

1150
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. All right. Well, that's cool. That is fantastic, you paid attention to your intuition.

1151
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:48.000
Trevor Burger: And I took all three strips this morning and I feel great. So it didn't make me down or tired like our saying I felt great so far. So we'll see how tonight goes

1152
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:59.130
Trevor Burger: Okay, because as soon as you told me that how you explained it yesterday about the, you know, I just want to reach for something that's it clicked in my I've never had it explained. That's why I

1153
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.870
Trevor Burger: Was wanting to do it. So as soon as I realized that I'm willing to change it so

1154
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just so there's this way, much like you did with with Chris there's I've identified what I'm going to do, I'm going to check it out. I'm going to pay attention to how I feel around it. Same thing with Chris as it is with this particular dosing

1155
01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, you try and sit with the understand it. We don't hold on to label for too long. It's not going to do I want to please one of their. No, that's not going to be a good motivation.

1156
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I. Is this an investment in my recovery and wait, wait a minute. No, I don't feel good. We want to know you just hold on loosely

1157
01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just stay in touch with it each time you get new information. Oh, I noticed a pattern here. I noticed a pattern there. I noticed I don't like this or I do like that just paying attention over and over to your intuition. Okay.

1158
01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. We You sound very excited.

1159
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:11.070
Trevor Burger: Yes, I'm doing really good I'm 10 times better. Okay. I think that the first relapse. I had in the last two months I

1160
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:30.000
Trevor Burger: I was creating excuses for why I couldn't do this or why I couldn't do that or why I wasn't putting my recovery first work was still first. And so finally I I've been putting this and everything before work for the past two weeks and I haven't ever felt better.

1161
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:42.090
Trevor Burger: And I told my boss, my boss is my hand so I told her I was and she understands. So she, she said, whatever you need to do. And I told her that I need.

1162
01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:55.740
Trevor Burger: To work. And so now, instead of working 10 hour days I'm working five eight hour days instead of 410 hour days. That way I get off at 330 in the afternoon, and that gives me time to go and

1163
01:49:56.610 --> 01:50:08.580
Trevor Burger: Meet with whatever I need to do to not work. You know, like, get away from work, because that's the one thing that was killing me. And so they've all okayed it so I'm excited.

1164
01:50:10.230 --> 01:50:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you can hear that.

1165
01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The course. The, the storyline that you weren't

1166
01:50:21.090 --> 01:50:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't the truth, but you it ran its course and

1167
01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way I could have made a difference because I've been saying it, but

1168
01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:38.190
Trevor Burger: I had to do it.

1169
01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You had to do it, that's just kind of the way we are. We got to find it our own way and I respect that. I get that.

1170
01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: As a you know a parent and a

1171
01:50:52.770 --> 01:51:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone who kind of cares about my clients. I wish I could get ahead of it for you until you don't do it. It's gonna hurt, but I can't. Unfortunately,

1172
01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.280
You guys have to experience it yourself.

1173
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that is true and it might also be that you can take in some cautionary tales from people

1174
01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were listening to the Teaching guy.

1175
01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there a cautionary tale that resonated for you.

1176
01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:47.940
Trevor Burger: I think more what what resonated with me, was his. This is more of his aura. He was kind of like a more abrupt up front guy like me kind of the Chris Guy almost seemed like he was intimidated by me.

1177
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's

1178
01:51:48.960 --> 01:52:03.120
Trevor Burger: What I mean, and that's what I'm saying. And the guy up front was like real in your face just preach and that's what because I can be. I don't mean this in a bad way at all. But I come off intimidating to people because I

1179
01:52:04.170 --> 01:52:07.440
Trevor Burger: I just do. I'm a big guy and I but

1180
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now listen here buddy you know your own mind. If you do, you are a highly intelligent and a man

1181
01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And your voice is strong and you're saying, a tall to I don't know your height but um you do you have a force you have. It's not timid, are you, you're not shy about you'll, you'll say what's on your mind.

1182
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't matter.

1183
01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:48.750
Trevor Burger: What I want back for me because if he can't because if he's going to be too scared to tell me that I'm messing up or to tell me you know and that's how I felt Christian would be he would be too scared to tell me stuff that I needed to know cuz he was gonna hurt my feelings.

1184
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:52.080
Trevor Burger: And the other guy seemed like he didn't give up.

1185
01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:55.560
Trevor Burger: He was going to tell me you know and that's exactly what I want. So

1186
01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:07.530
Trevor Burger: And I told Chris that I told him. Respectfully, I just don't think that mean you're gonna work out, man. I'm just, I told him, I said, I think you're just a little too soft for me. I'm sorry. And we just chuckled and said, I understand.

1187
01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, that's beautiful. That's an amazing, amazing stuff. Because here's what, here's what I'm picturing the addict is saying, you idiot. Why didn't you just take Chris. We could have just bulldoze right over his ass. It had been great.

1188
01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: We'd have suffered another one. We'd had someone on our side man would have been someone with street credit and he could talk to go in and say we're doing everything you you've got that addict inside running scared.

1189
01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That was really cool, really cool.

1190
01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.780
That's exciting. Okay.

1191
01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:57.450
Trevor Burger: There's a bunch of shit that happened last week that you don't know about, though. Oh, and it's an I was spoke about it in group, but I didn't want to take up too much time whenever you're asking, you know, what has happened to you all this week.

1192
01:53:58.770 --> 01:54:06.870
Trevor Burger: Oh last for a week ago tonight. My little brother got another do you wi his second one.

1193
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:22.110
Trevor Burger: His second one. He's 19 years old so I got my two DUIs whenever in 2014 and December and then 2015 in January, while I was still out on bond. I got my second DUI.

1194
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:34.350
Trevor Burger: Well, Connor got his DWI, and he had to sit in jail until Tuesday till his arraignment because they don't do bonds here that you have to wait to see the judge to get out now. They can't just give you a bond.

1195
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:38.130
Trevor Burger: And so, Connor got out and

1196
01:54:39.690 --> 01:54:47.610
Trevor Burger: You know, one of his friends moms was like, I'm gonna pay all your legal fees. You don't need to worry about it. And so he got out of jail.

1197
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:59.850
Trevor Burger: And came over to the house that night and he was like bragging about it and all this and and bragging that like he handled it. And it was nothing. I don't know why people think Joe so bad and

1198
01:55:00.450 --> 01:55:10.470
Trevor Burger: I'm going to get this case dismissed the most active I can, and it pissed me off because I in total. I've sat in jail for right around three and a half months.

1199
01:55:11.190 --> 01:55:19.530
Trevor Burger: And the longest time at one point was three weeks and I told I told my that's why it hit me so hard, because one of my brother went into jail.

1200
01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:30.900
Trevor Burger: I felt those three days like I was in there with him because I, I was just constantly reliving my situation that from me being in there and I was so worried about him and then

1201
01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:42.630
Trevor Burger: He got out and he just went, he was supposed to work. He didn't show up to work all weekend. So I've been having trouble like dealing with that. It's been hard because he's still just

1202
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, let's put a pin. Pin.

1203
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

1204
01:55:57.930 --> 01:56:01.470
Trevor Burger: Want to know more about that. Say that one more time to begin

1205
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know how you're dealing with what he's going through

1206
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:20.670
Trevor Burger: Okay, so this is the tricky part because I tried to deal with it by talking to my mom just personally does her about it, you know, just venting to her about how angry. It made me

1207
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:31.080
Trevor Burger: That he was taking it so light hearted because the next time, he'll be in there for three weeks and might not get out, you know, the next there might not be a next time he might, you know, he

1208
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:45.030
Trevor Burger: And my mom, kind of like jumped on me and got defensive end was like what Trevor, you've been there before. You can't talk about him, I said, I know I've been there before. That's why I'm so upset because I want him to get the help

1209
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:52.230
Trevor Burger: And y'all are just and I told my mom that said, Y'all are just enabling him still like his truck didn't get took away as his phone.

1210
01:56:52.650 --> 01:57:00.120
Trevor Burger: He's driving around, and I said, Mom, if you would have done those things for me i i'm not trying to tell you how to parent, but

1211
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:07.650
Trevor Burger: This was what would have really helped me whenever I was going through that was having my truck took away my phone took away.

1212
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:24.510
Trevor Burger: And some you know boundaries and she was like, well, he's not you. And so it just kind of made me upset because I still to this day, yet you know from my mom and my grandma, my brother, these little remarks like, Oh, you're just a drug addict. They just, they only hired you because they like

1213
01:57:24.630 --> 01:57:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear me. Come back, come back. Close your eyes.

1214
01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite you to go back go back to

1215
01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to experience something

1216
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:44.520
To know it. I have to

1217
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to know firsthand.

1218
01:57:50.130 --> 01:58:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This person is good for me, that person is not good for me. No one can teach that I have to experience it. Just sit with that for a couple seconds. We just talked about when we first got in here today.

1219
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to give that gift.

1220
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To your mother.

1221
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a gift.

1222
01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In the place of resentment towards her.

1223
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: An anger gift from the gift that she to

1224
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Will experience on her.

1225
01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Timeline.

1226
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where her limits are what she will tolerate

1227
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not for us.

1228
01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell her how to do it.

1229
01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: She'll find her way.

1230
01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You stay

1231
01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: With your experience of what's true for you.

1232
01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:10.200
Trevor Burger: That's the thing with me. Is it that like the night he got arrested Friday night. I didn't know about it. She didn't call me it was like one in the morning on Saturday morning, I guess.

1233
01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:24.570
Trevor Burger: So she called My aunt to go out there to get his truck, but next morning I just drove over to my mom's house to mow your yard and she is in the garage. And I was like, she was like, move and all this stuff. And I was like, Hey, why isn't Connor out here doing this. You don't need to be lifting

1234
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:32.970
Trevor Burger: And she she just started bawling crying and I was like what happened, what happened. She said, Connor DWI last night and

1235
01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:40.860
Trevor Burger: So we she told me what happened. But then she asked. She asked me, you know, what do I do like what do I do

1236
01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:47.400
Trevor Burger: What, what would have helped. She asked me, What would have helped you whenever you got out of jail. I said, well, the jails probably gonna help

1237
01:59:47.850 --> 01:59:56.850
Trevor Burger: But also, whenever I got out of jail, every time I got my keys to my car back and I got my phone and I got all this freedom. I got all this money in my pocket and y'all.

1238
01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:05.730
Trevor Burger: And I got another DWI, a month later, and while I was on bond and then they didn't give me a bond for that one. I had to sit in there.

1239
02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:20.370
Trevor Burger: And so I told her, and that's why I told her, and then Monday. Whenever I saw her, you know, and I understand it's got to be hard to discipline your kid after something like that. And I don't have kids and I don't know but

1240
02:00:22.110 --> 02:00:29.670
Trevor Burger: We didn't get in an argument at all. I just, it just, I didn't even tell her that I was feeling this way after at all. I just

1241
02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.080
Trevor Burger: Just makes me sad really

1242
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:36.630
Trevor Burger: It makes me sad. The most

1243
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. That's because you're feeling for Connor, he's acting hard instead of feeling his own fear, you're feeling

1244
02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.880
Trevor Burger: I know you feels it

1245
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.920
Trevor Burger: And I know he's scared. No.

1246
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's okay. But I want you to go

1247
02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:52.500
I want you to

1248
02:00:53.760 --> 02:01:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me that will actually I tried to do with you because you popped right into another story pop right out of it and you went and we didn't sit with them and and talk about it, but I'm gonna bring us back to

1249
02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:07.980
Trevor Burger: What came to my mind whenever we did. That was my, my mom asking me that

1250
02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to be able to identify what is difficult. If we say that that it is a gift because I give it to you.

1251
02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't tell you what you gotta do. I know I have to sit back, I have to be a compassionate witness. I have to hold space that you will find your way.

1252
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is difficult for me.

1253
02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do it for you. I can

1254
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:42.780
Trevor Burger: I guess you saying that made me realize something though is that

1255
02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:54.960
Trevor Burger: It's almost like my mom had to do that feeling I have from my brother. She had to fill that for me times 10 because my brother hasn't even scratched the surface of

1256
02:01:55.290 --> 02:02:13.470
Trevor Burger: I've been to jail seven times rehabs I don't mean that to brag it all 12 rehabs whatever three hospital four or five six hospital visits plus that so she's been had to see me and worry about me like that, you know, forever. And this is the first time I've had to do it for somebody else.

1257
02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Say that again. That last part. This

1258
02:02:16.410 --> 02:02:20.310
Trevor Burger: This is the first time I've had to fill up my mom's had to feel for years for me.

1259
02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:34.170
Trevor Burger: Towards somebody I LOVE WHICH IS MY BROTHER IS THAT FEELING A man is he. Okay. And they're like, Man, Man, and or worrying about like another human being, like,

1260
02:02:35.850 --> 02:02:38.820
Trevor Burger: I've never because I've been so wrapped up in drugs. I haven't ever

1261
02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:47.220
Trevor Burger: Especially there's just never been somebody else in my life that I truly loved and cared about that had an addiction problem. I was the one

1262
02:02:47.850 --> 02:02:55.680
Trevor Burger: So now there's my brother and I'm experiencing these feelings and it's just like that whole day like I just and plus that day.

1263
02:02:56.190 --> 02:03:07.140
Trevor Burger: After Connor got arrested at Saturday we were all meeting at the local bar here to have lunch it because that was a year of my grandpa passing. So my whole family was there.

1264
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:13.890
Trevor Burger: And Connor, they were all asking more Connors that and I was having to tell him you know he's in Lubbock, he's not here and

1265
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.560
Trevor Burger: My Mimi's crying because Connor didn't show up and it was just

1266
02:03:20.130 --> 02:03:21.840
Trevor Burger: So you are weekend.

1267
02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been talking

1268
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The talk of my poor mom for what she's been putting up with. So you've been saying that, to me, it's been empty.

1269
02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you felt it for the first time.

1270
02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, felt it.

1271
02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:48.750
Trevor Burger: And I told her I have no idea how you made it through these flash five years with me, I would have had a mental fucking breakdown

1272
02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So Slow, slow down.

1273
02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother is couple

1274
02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Best way she knows how now I met her. I met her. She is intelligent strong woman. Okay, just first body splashes stood her ground just she's really present right didn't, didn't sort of cower to anything about me. She was just very present and it can be very intimidating.

1275
02:04:19.650 --> 02:04:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So she I saw none of that. Now, hold on.

1276
02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother is doing the best she can you have some fancy little labels and I'm not disagreeing with you around that enable word but be gentle.

1277
02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, very gentle with that word, you and I might label. Some of the things the same way, but we're talking about

1278
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.210
Trevor Burger: Better

1279
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That has had to deal with this kind of sadness and

1280
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: He's doing the best

1281
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They've gotta gotta respect that.

1282
02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:03.480
Trevor Burger: And I do 100% but that's why it made me so upset because

1283
02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:10.020
Trevor Burger: She, she's been having to deal with it for me for so so so long, you know, and

1284
02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:18.030
Trevor Burger: Now it's starting with Connor. This is a second one. And so, but I'm sorry, let me try to put this into words how I'm thinking

1285
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.160
Trevor Burger: But now,

1286
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:33.030
Trevor Burger: I know she's been you know trying our very, very best she did the very best she could do with me. But now we're corner whenever she has

1287
02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:40.890
Trevor Burger: Whenever she can look at what happened with me. And I don't know, I feel like she can like

1288
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't you're full of it. You don't believe it. You don't believe she's doing she can you know better.

1289
02:05:48.090 --> 02:05:54.600
Trevor Burger: That's what I know. That's what I'm sitting on. That's not what I'm saying. I'm her excuse to me is, we did this for you.

1290
02:05:55.290 --> 02:06:03.150
Trevor Burger: The first two times you did this. And I said, Yeah y'all did that for me. And that's what kept happening. And that's her excuse, though, as we

1291
02:06:03.810 --> 02:06:11.490
Trevor Burger: We did this for you to Trevor, it's no different than you and that's her excuse of why she's letting him off easy and it makes me

1292
02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:20.100
Trevor Burger: So scared because she doesn't fully comprehend. I don't think the road that he is going down. If it doesn't stop.

1293
02:06:20.610 --> 02:06:28.860
Trevor Burger: Because she will have to watch me go through it, but she didn't have to go through it like me and I know what that pain feels like that. Connor is going to have to go through if he doesn't

1294
02:06:29.670 --> 02:06:39.810
Trevor Burger: And it's so it's such a deep connection I have to him, not because I know what's coming for him and I know how much pain comes from continuing down that road.

1295
02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus on your mom, I just challenged you and I don't think you can see it.

1296
02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're still doing the best you can.

1297
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:52.770
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I know.

1298
02:06:53.670 --> 02:07:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You want it to be something else you want her to stop that enabling behavior. I know you do. But you can't sit long enough, and I'm going to tell you something about us humans.

1299
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can't sit with an accept her just the way she is. She's going to continue to be argumentative and justify her position. Just hold on, sure, sure, sure. Wait, wait, wait.

1300
02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear it again if you can't hear her see her know her accept her just the way she is, she will continue to defend her position.

1301
02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen.

1302
02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Really listen

1303
02:07:39.150 --> 02:07:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not yes but not give it labels, because you know better and cautionary cautionary cautionary but just hear her.

1304
02:07:47.490 --> 02:07:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk for two seconds really sit with it for days.

1305
02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Come in with the I know better. You need to change. And look, this is what Nope.

1306
02:07:57.930 --> 02:07:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Something else can happen.

1307
02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: With containing notice my hands off here.

1308
02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:04.680
Trevor Burger: Yeah.

1309
02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice how when you said to me, I something snapped for me. Did I run in until you need to get your shit together your alliance SEC asides, and didn't

1310
02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You came

1311
02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To it.

1312
02:08:18.270 --> 02:08:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: On your own

1313
02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:31.620
Trevor Burger: Yeah, but I'm seven years down this road. You know what I mean. That's why I'm not even upset with my mom for for feeling that way because she is the way she is because of all the shit I put her through

1314
02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:42.690
Trevor Burger: She's doing it. She does it because of, you know, I'm the one that started all this, I always do that. But I'm having trouble explaining to you where my real

1315
02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, go go in a different structure, stop the storytelling and follow this structure, try this on. Hey, when I feel guilty because I or I feel

1316
02:08:56.850 --> 02:09:10.950
Trevor Burger: Scared. Okay, I got you. I feel scared that because of my mom doing it the best you can and her way and me staying completely out of it is gonna

1317
02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:18.570
Trevor Burger: Not be enough for Connor that he's going to end up going keep going down this road.

1318
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:28.230
Trevor Burger: That's the fear I have in my heart. And that scares me so bad because I've been down it and it makes me relive it like what I went through and

1319
02:09:29.070 --> 02:09:30.600
Trevor Burger: I don't want that for him.

1320
02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much information. Nobody can hold all this you just got your brain works so fast. And it's very possible that this additional Suboxone can be a bit of a stimulant. So let's just be mindful. So just stay here with me.

1321
02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1322
02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to hear back that you just made this about you.

1323
02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to yourself.

1324
02:09:57.690 --> 02:09:58.170
Hold on.

1325
02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your intolerance, a feeling the distress over the predicted outcome. You really don't like it. But remember, this is the first time I've never felt this kind of empathy for for someone, you just made.

1326
02:10:17.190 --> 02:10:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother's challenge and Connors denial or whatever label you're working with right now about you.

1327
02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go anywhere. Hold on. Just hang on.

1328
02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's the first time again broken record here that you have done.

1329
02:10:34.170 --> 02:10:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you somehow turn it around.

1330
02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's so intense, but you're making it about you, your innocence, you're demanding that she do something different, hear me, hear me.

1331
02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about you.

1332
02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you believe that even through all that you have for your brother and your mother that somehow it's circling back to your needs right now.

1333
02:10:57.810 --> 02:11:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's going to be careful. I don't want to push you.

1334
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.680
Trevor Burger: Know, I understand what you're saying.

1335
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:03.720
Trevor Burger: Okay, I understood that.

1336
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's just stay with it for a second. Just sit with

1337
02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It just have the quiet, let it, let it stay there.

1338
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's now what if that's true.

1339
02:11:19.770 --> 02:11:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Then just again compassionately witness

1340
02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the first time and oh my gosh, and now. Oh, well, okay, that's the story, but this is still really all about my familiarity my comfort with feelings, all that other stuff fodder. Right. It's just, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's you sitting with an emotion.

1341
02:11:46.470 --> 02:12:01.050
Trevor Burger: I don't know. I disagree with you on it. I feel like I'm fine with me. I'm fine with me feeling that scared. And as for my brother. I would rather filled out all day. I would just rather him have help like then I, I'd rather sit with all that payment.

1342
02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:02.310
On

1343
02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're telling me.

1344
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That the same way you had to come to terms and find your limit your realization of what BS. You're going to tolerate in your life. Hit your low or whatever catchphrase works.

1345
02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's different for Connor that you can take him by the shoulders and rattle him or a professional can get across to him.

1346
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And he'll take it secondhand he'll take it from a sermon. He doesn't have to live it. Is that right,

1347
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: For Connor, it's different. Why, why, he'll be receptive, I'll just say, Don't you understand how bad it's going to

1348
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't work on you but Connor.

1349
02:12:50.730 --> 02:12:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mom if he just come on. Come on. It's so bad. So

1350
02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they going to change or are you going to damage the relationship

1351
02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to argue

1352
02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel not understood criticized and judged. This is really

1353
02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: dangerous territory, what do, what to do, really.

1354
02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:34.320
Trevor Burger: Well, and the thing about all of this. Just, I wouldn't even put onto a sense to my mom or too much. I haven't even spoken to my brother about it but I

1355
02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:36.450
Trevor Burger: Said,

1356
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard you. She asked

1357
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.250
Trevor Burger: She asked. She asked me, What do I do

1358
02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:42.510
And so

1359
02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:55.530
Trevor Burger: I told her, I said, Look, I can give you advice or we can meet with Glenn because I really don't think she knows what to do. But then whenever I told her, What would, what would have helped me

1360
02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:03.600
Trevor Burger: And then she said, I promise I'm going to do it like I have to do it this last time I can't take any more is what she was telling me.

1361
02:14:04.170 --> 02:14:09.090
Trevor Burger: And she said, I just have to get it right. I need your help driver that's what she was telling me so I told her.

1362
02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:13.950
Trevor Burger: The one thing that I can think of that would have helped me was to have that stuff stripped from me.

1363
02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:23.220
Trevor Burger: And then to see her not do it. It just made me sad. And I didn't even tell her anything about her not doing it, it just sat with me, like, man, like

1364
02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:33.630
Trevor Burger: So I know she needs somebody to talk to you about. She just doesn't know what to do. And that's where I think my sadness. Is that like because I

1365
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:34.740
Trevor Burger: Hope that all

1366
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Your actor to the Allen on, you know, the same things that work for you. The reality testing that we wish that this notion of

1367
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of all, just keep spoiling them. I'll just keep giving them stuff. And I'll keep then they'll see then they'll feel that their loved. Yes, that's it. We keep doing the same thing.

1368
02:14:53.730 --> 02:15:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What isn't what what's the way I read the recipe. You guys have have plenty of evidence that you're loved from your mother, but there's a sense of

1369
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Follow through and limitation. That sounds like missing in your family dynamics somewhere.

1370
02:15:11.610 --> 02:15:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't disagree with you. So the answer is get professionals.

1371
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: She knows she's hooking you up with it. Well, there's the other side of this, there's the Amazon side. There's her getting a therapist. There's a one of her in her life.

1372
02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a good consumer get a good one. There's a lot of crummy councils and so they're getting one that you can trust feels like yeah I can kind of

1373
02:15:33.090 --> 02:15:33.420
Relate

1374
02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Advice from a child. A child to have

1375
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All many, many, many, many mixed emotions around how credible. Are you right. We don't meet how credible, are you

1376
02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I'm saying even unconsciously. It's like getting it from my son. I'm mad at him. I'm

1377
02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:57.060
Sorry.

1378
02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Your credibility is low and know it's weird, but she used to be getting it from someone else.

1379
02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:19.140
Trevor Burger: Yeah, and that's what that that's the thing like that night after he got arrested. She was crying and asked him for help. But now if I try to bring it up again. She's like, no, don't even want to hear about it. Don't bring it up.

1380
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:26.370
Trevor Burger: Exactly. But that's why I told you it's been hard for me to sweet to watch it just

1381
02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember biggest word that I have in my piece of paper right now.

1382
02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That

1383
02:16:33.930 --> 02:16:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the first time.

1384
02:16:36.510 --> 02:16:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You have felt

1385
02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:41.580
That deep wounding of

1386
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Double dysfunction self sabotage and

1387
02:16:47.550 --> 02:16:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: brings down a family.

1388
02:16:49.590 --> 02:17:02.430
Trevor Burger: You felt it. And the thing about it is, whenever I was going through all of mine, my dad was alive to help my mom so like my dad I listened to my dad and now Connor has this

1389
02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:10.860
Trevor Burger: Thing where nobody's going to tell him anything he wants to be just like my dad. That's why he drinks. That's why he drinks and drives

1390
02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:16.410
Trevor Burger: He's infatuated with my dad and he said, nobody is talking to me about anything.

1391
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:28.860
Trevor Burger: Unless it's my dad and my mom tells me I don't. That's what she told me that day, whenever she was crying to me. I don't know what to do. Your dad's gone I it's just me. I don't know what to do. And I said, Mom, I'm hoping as much. Do you want me to. But

1392
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:32.340
Trevor Burger: If I mean you got to do it.

1393
02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:41.490
Trevor Burger: But if you don't want me to find you. I just, it just made me sad and not watch it get followed through. Yeah, so

1394
02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The popper ecology stuff is

1395
02:17:45.450 --> 02:17:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: honored guests to have the presence of dad. I've been

1396
02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Witness with Dad gets to

1397
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Be there but

1398
02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're my client.

1399
02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: familiar territory.

1400
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You

1401
02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what your skills are

1402
02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, taking care of sad Connor. There, there, it's okay.

1403
02:18:22.290 --> 02:18:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. Oh, it's

1404
02:18:26.970 --> 02:18:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Broke. This is containing this heroes bad

1405
02:18:33.390 --> 02:18:34.740
Now that's about it for

1406
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to make sure you do not run away from this notion you know scramble you know projected on this else

1407
02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Threw it

1408
02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In there.

1409
02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:52.200
Trevor Burger: And it's not just being

1410
02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:53.700
Trevor Burger: There may be

1411
02:18:53.730 --> 02:18:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Other salads.

1412
02:18:56.940 --> 02:19:02.760
Trevor Burger: Well, I'll tell you what I've been doing. And the only logical reason I could come up with myself as to what to do.

1413
02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:18.690
Trevor Burger: Was to just sit in it and not get my mind off of it. I have to just sit in this and go through it and experience it and and get through it. I can't reach for that trip tonight. I can't you know I have to just sit through this, this part of

1414
02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the first time. So I think it would be nice even almost self sabotage to say, let's not do anything. I don't think there's anything wrong with doing what has worked in the past.

1415
02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You saw some of them. I can give. I can go, I can play I can do enjoyable activities, there can be prayer, there can be distraction. You write a list.

1416
02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Of literally things to do, going through. It doesn't mean and it could be trying to, it could be

1417
02:19:50.850 --> 02:20:03.420
Trevor Burger: Actually emoting know I have. Okay, but I'm saying like even whenever I'm at work at the one place that where I would my mind would go blank all week. That's all it's all my mind has been sitting in it.

1418
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:11.040
Trevor Burger: And I, I just, I've tried you know going on my walks I've taught my meditations that I do. I've tried my

1419
02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:21.720
Trevor Burger: Calling and I'm the and also that is real close to me that knows her name is Mel. She's the owner of the company I worked for my end, but

1420
02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:31.680
Trevor Burger: We had to go on a drive yesterday. So I talked to her. I kind of wanted to her about it yesterday. And that's all that's really I've been able to do is bent to people about it.

1421
02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to tweak one word.

1422
02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Try

1423
02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You realize

1424
02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:42.090
Trevor Burger: That's true.

1425
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing and succeeding.

1426
02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Been taking medication as prescribed. This kind of thing we're doing partner, relax. Have you been using other substance.

1427
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:05.820
Trevor Burger: Yes, I DIDN'T HEAR THE VERY BEGINNING OF THAT I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW IS A QUESTION.

1428
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is. So here it is. I'm picking it a word you're using and I want to tweak the word you're saying, try. So I would like you to see if that's true. Did you try all day yesterday and you ended up failing and you relapse.

1429
02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Relapse

1430
02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:30.990
Trevor Burger: No, no, no, no, sorry, that's the question you are asked me now.

1431
02:21:31.050 --> 02:21:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay right so in stead. Did you talk to your amped. Did you sit with an ugly thought a sad thought

1432
02:21:43.020 --> 02:22:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A scary terrifying thought about your brother to think disappointment around expectation of what your mother's doing. Did you sit and think about them. Did you work and do your best to focus on them again skills that you listed. Did you do them. And did you also relax.

1433
02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did them.

1434
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That part that's different. Here is

1435
02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have thought it would be easy.

1436
02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have thought, well, if I do these distraction things I'm doing these skills. I'm talking with them. I shouldn't feel

1437
02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad anymore.

1438
02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:39.150
Trevor Burger: That's why I was saying, um, I was trying to get rid of that feeling not trying not to relapse. And that's where I understand.

1439
02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to feel like shit.

1440
02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:42.360
Trevor Burger: Yeah.

1441
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You have been denying

1442
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: incident after incident after incident of when you're supposed to feel it. So you learn to find out what you really care about you have missed it. AND MISSED IT AND MISSED IT AND MISSED IT AND MISSED IT AND numbed out and numbed out and numbed out and now this time.

1443
02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the piece that I invite you to do. This is the add on, do your list come up with some more for today. Maybe some kooky ones. I don't know, hot bath cold baths to run. I don't know what I'm

1444
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:16.830
Trevor Burger: Going to show you something before we're done to

1445
02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The add on is this. I'm going to catch myself.

1446
02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: catastrophizing how I'm feeling. I'm going to catch it. I'm going to catch the meaning I'm making out of how I'm feeling. I'm going to catch it. I'm gonna put myself in check. And instead, I'm going to say

1447
02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This will pass. I'm going to sit here or this lesson will present itself a year from now, or tomorrow on know this feeling these emotions will pass, they will

1448
02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:56.100
Trevor Burger: The craziest thing about all of this is, I have never

1449
02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:05.040
Trevor Burger: Sorry, it's hard for me to put my thoughts into words. Um, so going through all of this.

1450
02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:09.840
Trevor Burger: Going through all of the discomfort, all of the

1451
02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:16.050
Trevor Burger: The, the regular things that would have made me relapse in the past and being able to just sit in it.

1452
02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:19.500
Trevor Burger: It has given me this feeling of

1453
02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:35.070
Trevor Burger: Peace of mind, because I'm behind all of that, because I know that I'm not leaving any stone unturned right now. So with my recovery. So I have a peace of mind in the back of my head that

1454
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:46.260
Trevor Burger: Me sitting through this pain is just working out my brain like it's just working it out just like a like a muscle would at a, at a gym, like it's just

1455
02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:55.770
Trevor Burger: Making me stronger and it's I'm handling it. I'm not wanting to relapse. So it's given me this peace of mind that even though all those shifts going on.

1456
02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:08.070
Trevor Burger: I'm okay, I can still, I can still just do what I need to do. I can continue my recovery. Regardless, and I've never felt that before. I've always felt like whenever shit hits the fan that

1457
02:25:10.050 --> 02:25:24.480
Trevor Burger: I have to figure out instantly. How to find some pills. Yeah. And now it's more like okay, who can I call real quick. Where can I go through this walk, real quick, where can I have this cigarette at. Okay, you know what I mean.

1458
02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the list. That's the relapse prevention list and don't minimize the actual listing of it. Because remember, we're very visual. People are choose a lot of it. Come visual habit.

1459
02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:46.590
Trevor Burger: I'm a big journal or I got I got 80 pages of journals from me just writing, writing and writing

1460
02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we turn a page. We've got a little bit of time. Let's get tangible. Let's go right to the very, very back. Let's go clean. Clean page right and then flip the

1461
02:25:56.010 --> 02:25:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole book down

1462
02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Upside down

1463
02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.110
The back

1464
02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: relapse prevention or you can call it whatever you want, but that's what it is.

1465
02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:11.700
Trevor Burger: Yeah, that's

1466
02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:25.800
Trevor Burger: That's why I like the new group too because I've been to 12 rehabs I know in the ends and outs of all of the relapse prevention trend and then you know I don't put them to use for he could, but I know it, I know it in here.

1467
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here we go. Um, I want you to put the belly breathing.

1468
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to put positive self talk, you may decide to write a prayer you do

1469
02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:42.600

1470
02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.680

Trevor Burger: The driving range. I love to hit golf. Well, I live literally 100 feet from the driving range. Celebrate Recovery exercise and I'm telling you a cigarette. Really, really calmed me down.

1476
02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I can't get behind that one. So I'm just going to shut up.

1481
02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:41.340
OK.

02:28:51.960 --> 02:29:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel statement time stamp it I feel disgusted. My mother just duck. The duck timestamp. I feel embarrassed when

1484
02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Fred, Fred it right in front of me and timestamp.

1485
02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.050

1486
02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:30.780
Trevor Burger: A um so my me and my cousin on our paychecks. We got yesterday, we both just bought all of the musical equipment to for us to start recording. Again, I write music and music. So I'm about to get back into that and that really, really helps. That's why journal so much

1487
02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but on that list. This is an encouragement that when your journaling. I don't know your style, but

1488
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's track some of these emotions because these are new for you. So when I say journal. I mean, you walk over, it's not a big time commitment, it's

1489
02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel you plug in the emotion word when my mother did this. My brother did this. My cousin did this coworker did this one short tight sentence period and walk away but timestamp it daytime walk away.

1490
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:03.660
Trevor Burger: You know how like the journal. I like to journal whenever I get there.

1491

Trevor Burger: I will write. I'll just start at the top know heading. It's not or anything. And I don't write with periods or comments or anything. I just right.

1492
02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:21.330
Trevor Burger: And I write and I fill up every single line in the end I just write exactly what's coming up to my brain. I put on the paper and then by the time I'm done with it.

1493
02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:28.830
Trevor Burger: I feel so much. I don't even know how to put into words, how much I explain it, but that's how many I wrote just now and I screenshot it that

1494
02:30:29.970 --> 02:30:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it can you screenshot your own relapse prevention, because that's the one that matters, take that one. Get that one on your phone that for you on your phone. So

1495
02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:42.090
Trevor Burger: Though I carry this with me everywhere I go. Okay.

1496
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:43.230
Trevor Burger: Good. Okay.

1497
02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's keep adding it let's keep adding on to it. Um, when you get ideas about it. We need ones that can be instant

1498
02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, two,

1499
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Times. We have not a lot of time. I won't be able to do a great job of teaching it.

1500
02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you learn through all of the stuff. And if you forgot the details, that's just about as good as I don't know the grounding in the five senses from the Dialectical Behavioral Therapy model did you learn that grounding in the five senses.

1501
02:31:15.810 --> 02:31:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sound familiar

1502
02:31:17.010 --> 02:31:19.110
Trevor Burger: Yeah, sounds familiar, but I

1503
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:20.430
Trevor Burger: Just don't know

1504
02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do it in front of you.

1505
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:24.630
Trevor Burger: done it before.

1506
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:26.340
Trevor Burger: I just don't remember the exact

1507
02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:28.170
Trevor Burger: If you're just getting grew up.

1508
02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:30.330
Trevor Burger: It's like a closed, I think.

1509
02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd let me just do it for you real quick.

1510
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:33.690
Trevor Burger: So you

1511
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Have it and I can slow down.

1512
02:31:36.270 --> 02:31:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: On next time I'm

1513
02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Here close that one this one. So it looks like this.

1514
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.030
Is this is going to be wrapped

1515
02:31:51.930 --> 02:32:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're in distress right you're noticing on unpleasant feeling this is not avoiding this is getting back in your body when you're having a strong emotion.

1516
02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You're possibly being hijacked by your amygdala. Okay. And so what you can do when you get back into other senses.

1517
02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:14.040
As in

1518
02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your eyes, your ears, your skin.

1519
02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Your all factory glands right your nose, your taste buds. When you get into other physiological senses.

1520
02:32:27.450 --> 02:32:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can remind the mind body where okay. It's not just this one piece of information flooding from the middle. It's not just that there are other parts.

1521
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Of awareness that I can attend to. So it would look like. Okay. I do it with a lot more than just five. So this is how it would look come and do it for you. Okay.

1522
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:50.280
Trevor Burger: What was the one

1523
02:32:51.060 --> 02:33:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Up taste. We can vary that one. It's like toothpaste or coffee or, you know, we can do a little bit, but you're going to see it done differently than the way that poster showed it

1524
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:04.740
Trevor Burger: They love it. Right. The five. Okay.

1525
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to look like this.

1526
02:33:10.170 --> 02:33:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Up sparkle brown and beige a rugged

1527
02:33:18.570 --> 02:33:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: stripy wave white beige crystal Lee point any rough

1528
02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I did actually is. I tried to name as many as I could and I

1529
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:34.770
Trevor Burger: Thought, there's five

1530
02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. Now you're about to do it. You ready

1531
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:38.340
Trevor Burger: Yep.

1532
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're looking at this object. Don't give it a label. Notice I didn't say crystal just adjectives go

1533
02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:51.420
Trevor Burger: Oh, and we're doing see. Yeah.

1534
02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Just dries.

1535
02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just your eyes.

1536
02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:57.870
Trevor Burger: Over silver

1537
02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What shape which

1538
02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:09.510
Trevor Burger: rhombus silver rhombus eyes triangle tail.

1539
02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What shape for the eyes.

1540
02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.410
Trevor Burger: Circle.

1541
02:34:13.890 --> 02:34:14.310
Out.

1542
02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on here.

1543
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:20.850
Trevor Burger: So I said, Tell that

1544
02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Label. What's it doing

1545
02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:24.390
Trevor Burger: Curve.

1546
02:34:24.690 --> 02:34:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Good.

1547
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:26.520
Or show

1548
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.860
Trevor Burger: Intention

1549
02:34:30.210 --> 02:34:30.570
Yeah.

1550
02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:39.000
Trevor Burger: Silver

1551
02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on.

1552
02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:46.320
Trevor Burger: Do W.

1553
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: When you thinking about anything else except trying to give me as many adjectives that you could

1554
02:34:55.230 --> 02:34:56.280
Trevor Burger: Not figure out what the fuck you.

1555
02:34:59.160 --> 02:34:59.340
Trevor Burger: Know,

1556
02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:00.480
Trevor Burger: Still, this

1557
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You do. That's right, because you wanted. Oh, that brain was like what's that it had something novel or brain loves learning something new and it loves novelty our eyes catch it.

1558
02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you capitalize on that and you try to label and you do it with fidelity. You don't use any

1559
02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Like labels of it. You don't be like oh it's rough. That's when you're actually close your eyes and you're feeling well that's a, that's a bump. It's sharp it's cutting. Oh, it's smooth. It's rough, it's it's bending I'm pointing temperature a warm notes cooler. I see.

1560
02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Temperature texture change. I had to concentrate. So here's I've got a couple minutes here. So it's like this. Your brain wants to do one thing. Well, it does. I know we say multitask.

1561
02:35:49.470 --> 02:36:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That on that it wants to do one thing. Well, if you don't like the direction it's going if you're starting to feed into the addiction voice or you want a little respite from the degree of sadness that's coming in.

1562
02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You do this exercise. And what happens is your brain wants to just focus on that you're going to do that one thing you're going to really give me as many descriptive words and look around you pick something up and you do it.

1563
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But only through that one sense, shiny round black bumpy curve move. Okay. Then I moved to hearing

1564
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, I want to tell you how it works. Bottom line, and

1565
02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You have neural networks you are in one before over sad everything connected with that you don't have any over this thing. I mean, you ain't never seen this thing before. So you're somewhere else and you focus on that.

1566
02:36:44.760 --> 02:37:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain gets a little break. Okay. Your body calms down heart rate goes down, respiratory rate shallow breathing changes little deeper. So it changes. So you do just the eyes and then close them. You just go here. I can hear the sort of ruffle throw my jacket.

1567
02:37:06.090 --> 02:37:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We're on, we're all sound from some sort of large like an air conditioner or something. I can hear my whiny scratchy voice I hear this pulsing of the blood, kind of in my ear outside of your lawn mower. I heard a clip from your side of the tele health

1568
02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard feedback over there. I heard your breathing.

1569
02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to really concentrate. You see that

1570
02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. Now it's touched tactile

1571
02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I take this, you put you can take your sweat shirt and especially if it's right on the edge of something where the zipper reaches this

1572
02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's complete. And then there's a theme and it's cool, it's

1573
02:37:45.090 --> 02:37:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Soft and squishy.

1574
02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: squishy and you try you try so hard to come up with more. The harder you try the more focus it takes and the further you get away from that other neural network.

1575
02:37:59.790 --> 02:38:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you go to

1576
02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:05.130
Trevor Burger: Doing

1577
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there we go. Right. And I've got hair.

1578
02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can hear. And then I pull in, what do we saw in this room maybe on my skin.

1579
02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that in and then taste better. Yes.

1580
02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's about it. Nasty.

1581
02:38:24.990 --> 02:38:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I'm out, I'm out of whatever shenanigans. I'm in charge. And what I want to think about right now.

1582
02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:34.050
Trevor Burger: shit I'm out after watching you do it.

1583
02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's overwhelming.

1584
02:38:37.470 --> 02:38:38.070
Trevor Burger: I hope

1585
02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:39.990
Trevor Burger: That's not the nose.

1586
02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Damn straight okay so grounding in the five senses, if you can remember with 54321 fine, but what you want to do is generate as many work hard.

1587
02:38:51.150 --> 02:38:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To come up with as many as you can. And just imagine I'm listening. Oh, did you do the temperature. Well, is that a shape.

1588
02:38:56.730 --> 02:39:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or did you just label it. No, I'm not gonna do that I'm going to try and come up with as many ways to describe it without a label. I'm a, I'm an alien from another planet. I'm reporting back. What do I see with my eyes. What do I hear with my ears.

1589
02:39:12.930 --> 02:39:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll talk to maybe it'll be in your feet. Maybe we like, oh, they're cold. Now I can. Oh, now I can feel my socks. I can feel more pressure on my heels than I do my arches. I can feel I'm rocking. Now it's on my friend of mine, and now it's back on my heels, give your brain a break.

1590
02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got it. That's a really cool one. That is a I've got you now have to bottom up. And that's your bottom up means we're not just doing cognitive stuff. We're working up, which means the body is informing the mind where. Oh, okay.

1591
02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting into your intro section I got fancy words for it doesn't matter. But anyway, you don't have to believe in it for it to work still gonna work.

1592
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:02.280
Trevor Burger: Yeah, okay.

1593
02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's schedule another appointment, just want to check, is there any medication bridge to today that I have to let Dr on real no

1594
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:15.750
Trevor Burger: No, she sent me in yesterday to get me to next Thursday. Yeah, to get through group.

1595
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling about this. This group.

1596
02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:20.610
Trevor Burger: Yeah.

1597
02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:22.440
Trevor Burger: Yeah, there's a

1598
02:40:22.470 --> 02:40:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Brand new though it's typically only like three or four people in there, it just blew up because I wanted to pump it up and have it be a bigger group.

1599
02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to see people that have have a little bit more

1600
02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:37.620
Trevor Burger: Well that and I don't really like

1601
02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:50.490
Trevor Burger: I don't really like the doctor elements approach on the medicine either like I feel like your mom is a lot more insightful and it's trying to help me get down as fast as possible. Instead of up

1602
02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:52.950
Trevor Burger: So I'm more comfortable.

1603
02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:54.090
Trevor Burger: With that

1604
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And if that changes, then just pay attention to it.

1605
02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:58.170
Trevor Burger: And

1606
02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Inform the work. So let's, we already have.

1607
02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't think you did you send me an email saying you would you would do this 30 day

1608
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:07.050
Trevor Burger: I will, I will right now.

1609
02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:08.490
Trevor Burger: I didn't go that day.

1610
02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what I do is I take it and it goes into the treatment plan. It's really a nice milestone of I'm saying I'm going to do it.

1611
02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you do we get to celebrate it. You get to brag about it, you get to feel proud about it because you work really hard. It's not an easy thing to do. And if you don't, then I get to say, hey,

1612
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder which part of these was hard to keep that you may be made a promise that you really knew you could build it useful.

1613
02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, to me, okay.

1614
02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.020
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I'm, I'm doing right now.

1615
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Oh my god group, don't I

1616
02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stick with this for individual therapy march 20 at 11am

1617
02:41:54.180 --> 02:42:00.060
Trevor Burger: Yes, ma'am. And I'll be at a group at 11 the day before. Excellent.

1618
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking forward to, if things get difficult. And the answer is yes. If you ever do want to do a family intervention. Yes, you can reach out to me for short term intervention stuff just to sort of be a bit of an icebreaker to the concept of what family therapy might look like kind of thing.

1619
02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.510
Trevor Burger: Yes, ma'am. I just sent the email back

1620
02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So that invitations out there too and without I say be good to you.

1621
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:23.940
Trevor Burger: Yeah.

1622
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget to continue to look at your relapse prevention sheet and reach out for connection human connection on cell phone.

1623
02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:34.260
Trevor Burger: Yes, ma'am. Thanks, Glenn. Have a good one.
