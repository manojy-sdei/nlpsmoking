Galaxy A20: Well, to get clean and because I just, I'm getting I'm I'm getting older and I just feel like it's not as fun as it used to be. It's more of a challenge to just stay regular I guess some my body hurts, all the time. So,

15
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.500
Galaxy A20: Most of that's probably my line of work but yeah just it's a pain in the ass, you know,

Galaxy A20: My cravings away and wonderful.

25
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.800
Galaxy A20: Withdrawals. You know, I know that because I haven't had any heroin. I know that I should be hurting right now, for sure. And it's been 72 hours.

26
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.580
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

27
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.130
Galaxy A20: I don't feel it at all. It's wonderful.

28
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:51.720
Serenna Beers: Oh, that's so great to hear. So then, do you, I'm guessing that you deal with chronic pain, and if so, tell me what what was the event that that started you down that long journey of chronic pain.

29
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.230
Galaxy A20: Okay, so I broke my leg. When I was like

30
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.920
Galaxy A20: Like 14 on a dirt bike.

31
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.510
Galaxy A20: And they prescribed me Vikings for like three months.

32
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.790
Galaxy A20: Because I'm broke I fractured my femur and broke my leg up pretty good.

33
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:29.430
Galaxy A20: So they yeah they I was on bike, it ends for like three months when I was 14 and i just i remember liking those. So by the time I hit 17 you know I was quite taken them on a pretty regular basis, you know, but I was getting them off the street, obviously, at that time.

34
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.750
Galaxy A20: Okay, and it just progressed, the heroin was cheaper kills got way crazy expensive.

35
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.040
Serenna Beers: Okay.

36
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:57.690
Galaxy A20: And then all through my 20s, I you know I did that I didn't never like and I got clean a few times, but I never. It was never like a problem, but now it's becoming a body issue like I just I can't, I can't do that. No more. It's breaking me down.

37
00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.740
Okay.

38
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.160
Serenna Beers: What about it. Have you, do you have any prior history of substance abuse treatment or mental or mental health.

39
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.990
Galaxy A20: Not mental health, but I have been a few outpatient programs.

40
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.640
Galaxy A20: Here and we're live in Fresno.

41
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.920
Serenna Beers: Okay. Can you remember the name of them. I mean, it doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but maybe around about do

42
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.550
Galaxy A20: One I know one was the Methadone clinic and then the other one was the BART station.

43
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.170
Serenna Beers: Okay. And had you successfully completed those are

44
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:43.860
Galaxy A20: No, not, not, neither one of those, because those were methadone and I felt like what I wouldn't end up happening is I like to know more than I like the heroin.

45
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.610
Serenna Beers: And they're

46
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.100
Galaxy A20: Getting it to me for free so I can get

47
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:58.590
Galaxy A20: Loaded on that shit. You know, I like. But with this Suboxone I just it you don't get high on it. It just takes your cravings away and you feel normal. That's what I like about this stuff.

48
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.850
Serenna Beers: That's wonderful.

49
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.070
Galaxy A20: I'm not the don't. I was just using it like a drug, you know, eventually didn't take long.

50
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.970
Okay.

51
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.250
Serenna Beers: What about growing up. Tell me about that. Tell me about like first specific what your

55
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:51.990
Galaxy A20: She did get married, but it was kind of like when we're older. I think I was in eighth grade when they first when they are like seventh grade when they first got married and then so, but it wasn't like, you know, wasn't

56
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.590
Galaxy A20: Your typical she was a single mother, but she also pushed a lot of dope through Madeira, so

57
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:14.550
Galaxy A20: When I was when I was 17 i think you know da kicked in our door in the shirts, the Medina County Sheriff's Office. They kicked in our door to call us kids away and we ended up living with my aunts and like we scattered along some of us.

58
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.590
Galaxy A20: And then when all that finally blew over and we were adults. When by the time that happened you

59
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.890

60
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.760

Galaxy A20: There was a lot of kids, you know, and she's by herself and all the dads were in and out of jail so

92
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.240
Galaxy A20: I mean I have to. Yeah, I have memories, nothing really stands out, you know, but I'm the type of person that

93
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.660
Galaxy A20: I guess I don't really go back, you know, unless somebody brings up a memory to me.

94
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.500
Galaxy A20: And I got

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.510

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.260
Galaxy A20: There was a war going on and I was gonna

102
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.780
Galaxy A20: I turned into a Turkey and Iran. Like I was going to take, I took the test and everything and

103
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:20.130
Galaxy A20: They evaluated me, but I never went in and signed the what it was is I thought $15,000 signing bonus was going to be something, but after I thought about it, I just, I turned into a turkey and I ran off.

104
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:30.180
Serenna Beers: And what about to see. Do you have any financial or legal issues that you are can't concerned about at all.

105
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:43.350
Galaxy A20: No, I've never really been in trouble. I mean, I've been in trouble. A few times, but it was all when I was younger and told them work out, you know, lots of times past financial issues. I mean, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor either

106
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.300
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Okay, what about. Are you in a relationship now at all.

108
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.110
Galaxy A20: Yeah.

109
00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.720
Galaxy A20: No, she's, she's really good for me. Um, we have three kids together.

110
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.680
And

111
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.050
Galaxy A20: I mean, we were good. There's no no, there's

112
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.360
Galaxy A20: She

113
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.520
Galaxy A20: She, she wants me to get better. That's

114
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.610
Galaxy A20: That then that's about a lot to, you know, but she also deals with a lot of shit today when it comes to me.

115
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:30.660
Serenna Beers: So she's supportive of you staying on this path and doing this Suboxone program for pain management versus using

116
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.350
Galaxy A20: That's good.

117
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:52.860
Galaxy A20: You know I yeah definitely that yeah cuz it was, it's always, you know, like when you say is it healthy you'd like to think it's healthy. But I don't know how healthy it is for her because she's not doing anything. And I'm a drug addict. So

118
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.550
Galaxy A20: You know she's been around it. So, but she doesn't accept it, which is a good thing because

119
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.720
Galaxy A20: That's a great thing.

120
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.420
Galaxy A20: And I'm ready to change to, like I said, I'm getting older.

121
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:07.770
Serenna Beers: I'm

122
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:20.970
Galaxy A20: Going to be in my mid 30s and I just my body can't take it anymore. That's i have i just i have i know i have to be sober, because the last time I was so grateful. I felt really good.

123
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.840
And then I'm

124
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.200
Galaxy A20: I relapsed like

125
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.840
Galaxy A20: I don't know, a year ago or so.

126
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:35.850
Serenna Beers: How was that was that quick or did it was it worse than what you thought it was going to be

127
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:44.130
Galaxy A20: It happened overnight. It seemed like and then it's like, almost didn't have a control of it.

128
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.280
Galaxy A20: Right. And yeah, and then

129
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.540
Galaxy A20: It went on for a while and that wasn't healthy because I was lying and trying to hide it.

130
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.380
Serenna Beers: And like

131
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.430
Galaxy A20: That's where like that kind of stirs problems up but then

132
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:10.440
Galaxy A20: It did kind of happen kind of fast, but in the same breath that kind of drug on to because it caused a lot of problems.

133
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.000
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

134
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:20.790
Galaxy A20: I spent a lot of money on that shit. If that's that's not cheap and to get to help it. You guys are providing me I

135
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.400
Galaxy A20: I appreciate it. So I tend to use it to my advantage.

136
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.360
Good.

137
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:38.160
Serenna Beers: Okay, so then I assume because my next quiz question was, who do you live with. Do you live with. Is it your girlfriend or your or or is she your wife or

138
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.540
Galaxy A20: My fiance.

139
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.570
Serenna Beers: Okay, your fiance and then you live with your three kids.

140
00:14:43.170 --> 00:15:00.600
Serenna Beers: Yes. Okay, cool. I'm thinking if I wondering if I missed anything. What about if you were to name like what are three specific goals. Let's just think of three that you hope to get out of your time with bright heart health. How do you plan to improve your life.

141
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.410
Galaxy A20: Well, I want a

142
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.830
Galaxy A20: Obviously, I'm here to get clean but

143
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.150
Galaxy A20: I want it to be.

144
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:22.050
Galaxy A20: Long term. You know, I've done a few times where I did, I quit. For a while, but it seems like after a year or maybe sometimes less than a year.

145
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:31.140
Galaxy A20: But usually right around a year. It's like, I find myself back in the same circle doing the same things. And, you know, telling

146
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:40.560
Galaxy A20: My girl that all no of course not but you know how it really happens is that you go to a party and you go and party.

147
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:51.510
Galaxy A20: And you do that and then you wake up the next day and you have to have more because you feel like shit. And what happens is is you get caught in this like endless cycle again it's

148
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.140
Galaxy A20: It's an eye.

149
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.670
Galaxy A20: When really, you should just stop or before you even start.

150
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:07.050
Serenna Beers: Well, it's when you have a choice, until you pick up again. So if you've been clean for, let's say, a month.

151
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:19.020
Serenna Beers: And you do have a choice. But once you pick up you lose the power of choice. And that's when it becomes you become powerless you you no longer have that choice because you've already fed the

152
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:32.040
Serenna Beers: Fed, the, the, the lion or a dragon. What, whatever you want to call it, and then it's off to the races. And every time that you get some clean time and you pick up again.

153
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:46.680
Serenna Beers: You go right back to where you started that much faster. I mean, it is really honestly it wipes you out faster every single time that you get some time and then you pick up again. I mean, and that's what addiction is it's just crazy.

154
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.680
Galaxy A20: Yeah, it is pretty wild. Sorry.

155
00:16:50.070 --> 00:17:08.610
Serenna Beers: Yeah okay so i. So, what I hear is you want goals like relapse prevention skills real relapse prevention skills so you don't get to that year marker or six months marker and you think, Oh, well maybe I can just party for a night when of course we know that that's not what happens. Correct.

156
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:18.870
Serenna Beers: You would like some skills to be able to put those in place so that way when if that happens again and you're put in that spot.

157
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:37.620
Serenna Beers: You remove yourself from that high risk and you're able to apply those skills. So I hear that. What's a couple of other things that you want to get out. Besides way. I heard two things you want sobriety and you want to be able to not relapse. And then what about a third thing.

158
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.080
Galaxy A20: Yeah, want long term I'm

159
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.090
Galaxy A20: I'm

160
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.500
Galaxy A20: Really, that's the main two things. But if you guys are going to counsel me to maybe you guys can find out what's wrong.

161
00:17:52.290 --> 00:18:02.190
Serenna Beers: Well, I do know that that we have, you know, lots of various types of services, everything from, you know, individual therapy trauma therapy.

162
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.110
Serenna Beers: I mean, substance abuse, education, there's all kinds of things. So I would highly

163
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:18.600
Serenna Beers: Recommend you know to really use us for what you need to become well mind, body and soul, you know, because it's not just about what you put in your body.

164
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:27.870
Serenna Beers: It's about why because it's not about what you use. But why you use it to begin with. You need to get to the root of it. And that's hopefully what we're going to be able to help you find

165
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.120
Galaxy A20: Okay, yes.

166
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.160
Serenna Beers: So how does that sound.

167
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:43.050
Galaxy A20: I'm okay with it and I'm ready, like I'm on I'm feel better than I did the day that I called you guys I'll tell you that.

168
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:55.860
Serenna Beers: That's so wonderful. Okay. Well, I don't know if I'll see you again if you who you're assigned to. But do you have group setup. Do you, do you know which groups that you're supposed to attend or anything.

169
00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:10.770
Galaxy A20: Not yet. I'm fairly new so damn sure they're going to tell me sheet. The first meeting that we had was like this one on one. I thought it was going to be in a group meeting. That's what I took from the initial when I did my

170
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.810
Galaxy A20: My

171
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.050
Galaxy A20: drawing a blank. So when I

172
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.930
Galaxy A20: Thought you guys did an intake on me.

173
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.340
Serenna Beers: I screening. Okay.

174
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.050
Galaxy A20: Yeah, when she told me that it was gonna be like group meetings. And I was like,

175
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:35.820
Galaxy A20: When I called and did that for the first time, it was just hurting me. And then she said, but we were going to do group meetings.

176
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.070
Galaxy A20: Mm hmm cool with that because I've kind of like to hear everybody else's horror stories, you know,

177
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:52.290
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm. Sure. Well, then what I will, I will let them know at the clinic that you've finished your assessment will, they will know after this anyway because then this is

178
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:10.200
Serenna Beers: Transcribed and all the information that you shared with me, we'll get to the doctor who prescribes you this Suboxone as well as whoever your therapist is going to be. And somebody will be in touch with you to set up your individual sessions as well as your group sessions. All right.

179
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:18.090
Galaxy A20: Now can I tell you this. And I don't know if you can get this back to them or what but so when we first started

180
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:33.810
Galaxy A20: My doctor, we had, we had agreed on, because I have taken this before and we had agreed on a sheet and a half a day and with me working and everything. I just, I've been taking two

181
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.960
Galaxy A20: And she said that if that happened to just

182
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:46.620
Galaxy A20: let you guys know and that she would get it figured out to her, you know, my next prescription or whatever I can get the, the two instead of the one and a half.

183
00:20:47.040 --> 00:21:04.590
Serenna Beers: Okay, so what I can do is send a message to the virtual clinic when we're done here to let them know that you're inquiring about wanting to discuss with your doctor your dosage because of your work. You're taking two instead of one and a half. Correct.

184
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.890
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

185
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.360
Galaxy A20: Okay, I'm going to

186
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.670
Galaxy A20: sleep better at night.

187
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:19.440
Serenna Beers: Okay. All right. And then if you don't hear anything back from them, you know, and you need to find out, then I would recommend to go. Go ahead and and call in, just like you did.

188
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:28.170
Serenna Beers: This time to do our assessment and then you can share with them what what what you shared with me if they don't get back with you in time.

189
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.470
Galaxy A20: Yeah, cuz I was going to do that, but I think they close at five. So I was just going to tell you, while I have you on here and I will

190
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.330
Galaxy A20: Go through

191
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.060
Serenna Beers: Okay, well, I will. I'm as soon as

192
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:50.430
Serenna Beers: We hang up. I will send this message and let them know what you're asking for. And I do. I thought our virtual clinic, you could talk to somebody 24 seven

193
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.400
Serenna Beers: Yeah, I am.

194
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.990
Galaxy A20: Still learning the rules so

195
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.480
Galaxy A20: Maybe I can maybe I will just hang up with you.

196
00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:58.110
Serenna Beers: I would say

197
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:07.740
Serenna Beers: Maybe you should call because then we cut out the middleman me who. This isn't my area and then that. That way you can find out firsthand what you need to know.

198
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.340
Okay.

199
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:18.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, perfect. Well thank you very, very much. Justin I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and I wish you the best of luck on your new adventure with us.

200
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.220
Galaxy A20: Thank you. All right.

201
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.570
