4
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your plan with

Gwenevere Abriel: With your kids right now cuz I can see you're not alone. What's going on.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.150
Daniel Guerrero: I'm actually a like I'm like kids are home from school. And so I just, I'm on my way home right now so they'll be able to

8
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so that's fine. How many minutes away.

9
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.010
Daniel Guerrero: I'm actually like about two and a half minutes away from home.

10
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go ahead and log off. Get Your Kids settle in, get them something to drink. Get them busy doing something and then log back in and you and I can settle in and talk. Okay, see if you can find a room where you can have some privacy. Okay.

11
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.960
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

12
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll stay here you

13
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Got yourself a competition.

14
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

15
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I know how life is. It gets busy.

16
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me save getting a note to where we left off and

17
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: He's still liking your new spot where you're living

18
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.500
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, it's great. Oh my goodness.

19
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:14.040
Daniel Guerrero: Like, it's just like, Well, to be honest with you, I think it's like a stress reliever. You know, because, and the other house that we're living in.

20
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:25.890
Daniel Guerrero: It was like it was it was a three bedroom, but it was like a plain Jane basic kind of a three bedroom house had like the living room and dining room was one room on

21
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:41.580
Daniel Guerrero: And then two rooms in the same area joint together. So there was two rooms and then it had a background. And then of course the kitchen and the bathroom was in between the two rooms and so like I'm gonna be honest with you. It was just like

22
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:55.050
Daniel Guerrero: And then finally, when we got our kids back the house went from being big enough to be too small because it was were cluttered together right know like a pack of sardines or something. Well, anyway.

23
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.950
Daniel Guerrero: And so, but our new home that we have moved into

24
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:15.540
Daniel Guerrero: The kitchen and dining room are one part of the house together and then has the living room and in a hallway where three bags are created two and a half, so I don't have to share a bathroom. My kids anymore. That's great.

25
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, my goodness.

26
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.790
Daniel Guerrero: And ended up as

27
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:33.780
Daniel Guerrero: A backroom that joint with the garage and it's all area so like we have a driving garage where we can drive in and just coming to our home so i mean it's it's amazing, it's

28
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: Awesome. Good.

29
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now ready. So let me see.

30
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What what we left off with

31
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do a little bit more, um,

32
00:07:53.190 --> 00:08:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep developing this preparation phase. Let's do a couple more activities today. Okay, kind of getting into some creative visualization

33
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: First one.

34
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to think about a distancing metaphor, either we did it or didn't land in this next note. Does that sound familiar if I said to a distancing metaphor. It's an imagery of maybe you standing on

35
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The side of a lake. And there's a, like a leaf or something or down a river, and you can picture the leaf sort of floating further and further away. Did you and I establish a distancing metaphor, like that.

36
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.210
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I know we

37
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.390
Daniel Guerrero: Believe we went through a

38
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective figure nurture figure wise figure we did that one.

39
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.290
Daniel Guerrero: Looks breathing, something like that.

40
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice nice nice nice this these other two things that container. I want to do with you right now and then distancing metaphor.

41
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: They have to do with setting up down the line, wanting to do some em Dr work with you. But this is just a preparation part. So let's do this together. I want you to picture.

42
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you have a negative emotion you have anger, fear nervousness anxiety.

43
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe an old memory comes up sometimes what will happen in in our in therapy. Some of those old feelings will come up

44
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I may say, okay,

45
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have enough time in session today. Let's put a little bit of distance with that or you might get so upset.

46
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That your heart rate is raising and we don't want to de escalate it a little bit. This distancing metaphor can be used to put distance between whatever it is that is distressing but distance between you and it

47
00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So for people. Again, the picture there on the beach.

48
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: They can see a sailboat, the sailboat is sailing away. They see a spaceship and it takes off into outer space.

49
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And other words. Here you are. And you put that negative memory you put that negative thought on that airplane spaceship sailboat leave something and it's getting further and further away. So for you.

50
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be imagery that I can write down. I can use in the future to kind of put a little bit of distance what comes up for you. What do you like

51
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.240
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, it's kind of crazy that you did you say this because today.

52
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.880
Daniel Guerrero: Um, I was thinking about, I was outside. And I was thinking, uh,

53
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:53.280
Daniel Guerrero: You know how long it had been. I don't know if this is going to be like right but i think of how long we had been in since I have a drink.

54
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:02.130
Daniel Guerrero: And I was thinking, and I was thinking about, you know, some of the negativity that came with when I was drinking

55
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:12.690
Daniel Guerrero: And so, so this this January or actually last month, so it has been 10 years since I

56
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.210
Daniel Guerrero: Mean any alcohol.

57
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:23.730
Daniel Guerrero: Or any any just any beverage that has alcohol and I'm talking about beer, wine coolers, just anything

58
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.520
Daniel Guerrero: And as I was thinking about, I was thinking about all the negativity that had came with it, you know, because

59
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:42.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know, let's be honest, you know, sometimes we get drunk and some when somebody says the wrong thing. We may take it the wrong way. And, you know, we get excited we get super excited and then

60
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:50.310
Daniel Guerrero: It just, you know, and so that's what that's what I was thinking about today. I was I was honestly just

61
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.610
Daniel Guerrero: Like you said, it was just like, just go and just like fading away like it was no longer a part of me.

62
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative

63
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative imagery of maybe Acting impulsively.

64
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.970
Daniel Guerrero: Whether an

65
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.960
Oxygenated

66
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see it fading away just, let's just solidify that imagery, a little bit more. See if you can picture. Some of the things I said, whether it's

67
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's fading away how on what vehicle. Where are you, well, it's fading away. See if we can come up with some some more imagery around that.

68
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.100
Well,

69
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.110
Daniel Guerrero: For me, as you know, as it's fading away, you know,

70
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.020
Daniel Guerrero: I can

71
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:43.260
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because, um, we had a brother and I, you know, had a real bad falling out at that time. And so

72
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:51.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know as that fades. It's like my relationship relationship, you know, gets it gets bad you know

73
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:58.440
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, and so it's to me as it's positive it's a positive. I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but

74
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We're almost there. So I'm looking for something a little bit more concrete. So picture this, I'm going to give you examples again and see if you come up with your own imagery or you like one of the ones that I use. So, picture you're

75
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: At a lake, and you take that negative memory or maybe it's alcohol or something and you can see it kind of maybe on

76
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A boat speeding away moving away from you or you're in the forest and there's a creek.

77
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see this little thing coming down and maybe it's a little leaf. So it's really light and it's moving a little faster. It's kind of whittling its way, but then you see it passes by you.

78
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And it passes further away.

79
00:13:49.110 --> 00:14:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're at an airport, you're left at the airport, what you put on this airplane is some of this negative imagery and you watch it take off into the sky and it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

80
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Or like on a spaceship and it goes way off in the outer space or in a balloon where it takes off, but you go ahead, that's

81
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.770
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I like that. I like that, even though

82
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.840
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

83
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.890
Daniel Guerrero: It is kind of reminds me of, you know, we can heal in a bloom and you let it go.

84
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:34.590
Daniel Guerrero: You know and how it just, you know, just drips and drips and drabs and then it's just like you don't see it anymore.

85
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, well, though it

86
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.410
Daniel Guerrero: Kind of like that, you know, I kind of like that a little bit.

87
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, you will use that one. I like it. Okay, so we've got this sense of for you. There might be times where you can picture it in the balloon.

88
00:14:52.890 --> 00:15:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's helium and, of course, then it's going to rise. And then it's going to drift away. So it's a tiny little dot and then you can't distinguish it from the blue sky. The clouds and just disappeared. So we'll get that one. That's great. Love it.

89
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do another one. This one has to do with compartmentalizing this one is putting in a box or doesn't have to be a box just a container.

90
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, probably going to be big emotional reaction.

91
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be a negative memory that you have a we, you and I might be at the end of the session running out of time. And I might say, okay,

92
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness. We only have two minutes. I want to have time to process how you're doing. Let's take what's coming up for you. Now let's say it's a negative belief about yourself.

93
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Might say okay, let's figure out a way to put that in the container and I can already tell what the container is. And so we're going to build it right now. The requirements for a container. This is that whole visualization thing, just like the the helium balloon. It's your imagination. Okay.

94
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you to picture our container that is big enough strong enough to hold all yourself.

95
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So first thing that comes to mind what as soon as I said that what came to mind.

96
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.100
Daniel Guerrero: To me it was like a metal container.

97
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.570
Daniel Guerrero: It like a

98
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.760
Daniel Guerrero: Like a safe or something.

99
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say, okay, about how big

100
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:31.140
Daniel Guerrero: Um, well, we said big enough to hold me so you know i'd be at least five you know 557

101
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.200
Daniel Guerrero: Pounds, so like

102
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.580
Daniel Guerrero: This just do like a 66536

103
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.010
Daniel Guerrero: Like that.

104
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So the requirements for this container are that it'd be big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff now stuff is a really general term doesn't have to be you. But it's kind of interesting that you you had said that

105
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's go with it. We got a safe and it's about 653 and is it a key safe is it a combination safe, what, how is it locked

106
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.680
Daniel Guerrero: Use a combination lock it.

107
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And who knows the combination

108
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.480
Daniel Guerrero: Just myself. Okay.

109
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: None by just the client. Got it.

110
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And there might be times when I might say well how yes let's let's put it inside that safe.

111
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And will this stuff, want to stay

112
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, will it want to stay in there, or will it want to come out. So for some people. Let's see if this piece comes up for you. Is there anything in that safe that all of that negative stuff will want to stay inside the safe.

113
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.550
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I, I kind of think we're, you know, following you. A little bit, yeah.

114
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:10.110
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, there's, there's some stuff that you know I would want to put in that safe and, you know, leave it there.

115
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so is what's going to keep it there. The fact that you can lock it in. Is that what's going to keep it there.

116
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.620
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, because I think you know once once it's locked in. It's pretty much a done deal.

117
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.400
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's

118
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.500
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

119
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.170
Daniel Guerrero: You know what a

120
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.830
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I'm going to use this as like, you know, if you lock something up, then it's safe, you know,

121
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.440
Daniel Guerrero: Something in a safe, you know, and you knock it it's safe there and

122
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about that. Right.

123
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.570
Daniel Guerrero: But you can't access it unless you open right so

124
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And so what may happen is you in a you and I might bring something up.

125
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you want to go about your day. You want to play with the kids. You want to have a work day, whatever it is, and you don't want to bring it out. You don't want to be preoccupied with worrying about it, analyzing it questioning it.

126
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be left in there. And then when you and I meet again, we can say, do we want to take that out again or leave it in there. Okay, so I love your thinking, That's beautiful. It sounds like we've got a great distancing metaphor.

127
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You already had this imagery of fading away that's outstanding and we also have this safe.

128
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

129
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little bit

130
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.380
Oh,

131
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know what I was gonna ask you, Have you had a chance to remember on your own in a slightly or highly stressful situation.

132
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you remember to do the box breathing on your own.

133
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.890
Daniel Guerrero: Yes, ma'am.

134
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.240
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I want to be honest with you, I, I use it quite a bit, you know, because

135
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, love it.

136
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.330
Daniel Guerrero: No, there's

137
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:26.070
Daniel Guerrero: No that and i'm not i'm not i'm not a real guy, you know, I try not to be, you know, um, but sometimes it just helps me, you know, because, you know, I have some stressors at work.

138
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.390
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

139
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:35.130
Daniel Guerrero: Where's being a manager at my job. You know, sometimes, you know, so thanks get put them on my shoulders that are stressful.

140
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.460
Daniel Guerrero: And and only not only a work, you know, at home as well.

141
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.450
Daniel Guerrero: So, so

142
00:20:46.680 --> 00:21:00.180
Daniel Guerrero: To me, it's been effective and and i'm not just making this up. You know, I'm being 100% honest with you, I, I, you know, when it starts going to sell that at work. I go outside.

143
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:10.080
Daniel Guerrero: The door, take a, take a few like a minute or two. Yeah, create the box breathing and then

144
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.180
Daniel Guerrero: Come back in

145
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.850
Daniel Guerrero: You know release and

146
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.100
Daniel Guerrero: And slow

147
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.200
Daniel Guerrero: For me,

148
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.560
Daniel Guerrero: Do the it's been effective. It's a

149
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.060
Daniel Guerrero: bad word. Yeah.

150
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the go to for most people, that's the one that's the one. They'll remember because they've been practicing it a lot, they'll remember that one and then they can remember some of the other things maybe there'll be a unique kind of

151
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Reframe a thought that they can go to, so that they're not staying pissed off or not feeling overwhelmed.

152
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you're doing is you're making sure that whatever happens you're going to do you in a relaxed body.

153
00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to function so much better when you are muscles are relaxed all the blows where it needs to be. And that's super smart. I'm glad you're remembering to do that you can do as much as you want to.

154
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know down the line, something you want to do eventually is to teach it to your kids. So the more you're practicing it, the more you can really sell it and like it works, guys, here's how we do it.

155
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's fun. I'm so glad I'm so glad it's there for you. And it's there for you forever. Okay, it's yours.

156
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so there's another thing I want to do. And I think with the time that we have

157
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't think there's going to be a lot of interruption. I'd like to develop

158
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And this this one can take

159
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of depends. It can take several sessions or just one kind of depends on on how how it goes. I just want you to know that there's no wrong way to do it.

160
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but I do want to see if I can get a little bit more light on your face. I can't see you much. Is there any little lamp that could go

161
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.360
Daniel Guerrero: To adjust. I can adjust

162
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're good. I just want to see if I feel a little bit more of your out of that.

163
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.720
Daniel Guerrero: I just wanted my hands to be free, you know,

164
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna really want it for this activity.

165
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.680
Daniel Guerrero: Let me see if I can open up this curtain right here and Jason might

166
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.080
Daniel Guerrero: Bring some light to

167
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:23.700
Daniel Guerrero: My room.

168
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:28.980
Daniel Guerrero: Yo,

169
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.510
Yo,

170
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.340
Daniel Guerrero: We are still no

171
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, I've been to

172
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.890
Daniel Guerrero: You by just hold you up, you know,

173
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I don't want you holding me know we play work. I'm gonna watch you really relaxed.

174
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.280
Daniel Guerrero: I liked it. That was good. I can see your friends. Let me go grab a chair.

175
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You got any better.

176
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.160
Daniel Guerrero: All right.

177
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You start this activity.

178
00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta say a couple of times, because people start to think, oh, maybe I'm doing it wrong. There's no way to do it wrong.

179
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you can already tell some of the things I asked you to do, or like why she asked me to do this.

180
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But it will it will over time become clear what some of these interventions are for that other stuff that I've been talking with you about the container.

181
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The figures right with those qualities, those three three figures.

182
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: As well as the distancing metaphor are really very much in preparation for em Dr work that I may want to do with you down the line.

183
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But this one right here. I want to develop in what's called an anchor and it's a resource for you, but a lot more goes on as we do it than just a resource from okay oh you got you wanted to me to tell a kid to do something.

184
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.790
Daniel Guerrero: Whats up. She's going

185
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:03.420
Daniel Guerrero: I'm going to doctors leading on the phone will thank you know you may not. He's going side, baby.

186
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so this is how it starts.

187
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about something in general in kind of your, your life these days. That's still kind of a struggle for you. You've tried to throw solutions at it.

188
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But it just keeps happening. It's like this. This is a challenge for you. It continues to be a challenge.

189
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's a relationship. Maybe its relationship with yourself. Maybe it's a self esteem thing. I don't know what it is, but I want you to think about where you're still feeling blocked in your life, still kind of stuck.

190
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.670
Daniel Guerrero: Myself, it would

191
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.430
Daniel Guerrero: Percent honest with you, I think.

192
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.190
Daniel Guerrero: I think it's like, you know, getting

193
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.690
Daniel Guerrero: A lot more to say like angry or like well I just little, little, little shit but

194
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get angry over little things. That's kind of gets it.

195
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.410
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. I don't know.

196
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.500
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, like they say, oh,

197
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:28.080
Daniel Guerrero: I guess they use like that. Oh, CDC. I don't know what the hell that means where they're like, Oh, your own CDC, you know, like, okay, oh, because you know like

198
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:38.460
Daniel Guerrero: And it's because it's not that i i expect like you know thanks to be a certain way. I just liked him to be a certain way. You know what I mean, like,

199
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:49.290
Daniel Guerrero: For example, when I go into living room. I don't want to see toys thrown all over my living room. I like you got a room, go take that to your room, you know,

200
00:27:49.980 --> 00:28:00.840
Daniel Guerrero: That bothers me like I'm like, get this crap. Pick up, you know, take this shit to the room. That's why you have. Do you want to play with your toys to play with them in your room or go take them out.

201
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.390
Daniel Guerrero: No, I go

202
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And use right. Yeah, I understand.

203
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So a lot of what you're going to notice is, you're going to be almost Wait, you'll give me an answer and then you'll wait for my next question you'll give me an answer on your wait for me to kind of guide. The next question. We're going to go on a little journey.

204
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure it's not something you've done before. It's a little different.

205
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked this idea from you that you're kind of, you want to make a change around how you react to little things, and you're not liking so much the anger. Am I getting that

206
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the only thing that the only two things that we're going to be doing that, I would call regression, which is we're going to go back in time and I'm going to be asking you to things that have to do with history. The rest of it.

207
00:28:52.230 --> 00:29:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your creative mind. Do you know the creative stuff because we did it with the container and all of that. It's where your imagination comes in some really interesting information can come out.

208
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If you give yourself permission to give me that first thought that first somatic response if your stomach tightens if you notice

209
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you got tense. Here are all of a sudden, if I say, well, let's scan your body and your hands are tight. Those are the things I'm going to want to know about.

210
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see your whole body. I can see your whole body. I probably wouldn't have to ask quite as much but I'm heavily relying on you narrating what's going on.

211
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, my point is I'm going to be guiding you with another question. Another question another invitation, your only job is to turn inward.

212
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And for this one, you don't have to have your eyes open. A lot of times we can turn inward. A little easier if we close our eyes and we can just say, Okay, I'm going to get my information from my body.

213
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: From my mind and from that sort of emotional space. Okay. So right now I want you to think about

214
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the earliest age that you remember

215
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That kind of anger being angry over something right so little.

216
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.650
Daniel Guerrero: Probably like 10

217
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Did 10 year old have a nickname.

218
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.040
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

219
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.320
Daniel Guerrero: baloney.

220
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like that nickname.

221
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:25.410
Though

222
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't really want to use it if it's an one, you don't like what should we call this younger version I can call it the child. I can call it the 10 year old. What would you help because we're going to be distinguishing adult from child here.

223
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:39.960
Daniel Guerrero: Gordon.

224
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.910
Gordo

225
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay with that one.

226
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay all right order. There we go. Age 10

227
00:30:50.940 --> 00:31:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And those are the only things that I'm going to be asking you to dip into actual memory. In other words, your mind may try to force it like I want to remember. But that isn't what the activity is asking you to do. I want you to catch your first response to my next question. Okay.

228
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

229
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture this home which you just got into that's neat when she to picture this home.

230
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of be present with Gordo as a 10 year olds right just kind of see if you can put those two things together yeah Gordo

231
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.580
So I got

232
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: getting irritated over the littlest things

233
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're in this home that you're in now. And now I want you to add a room.

234
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what this is all about. It's about an anchor room and in this room, you can have whatever you want. It can have every single thing that you need and that you want.

235
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to imagine adding it to this new home mature in because that's where you're living now.

236
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And what comes up for you. How big is it what does it look like in there just sort of describe it.

237
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.780
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

238
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.970
Daniel Guerrero: Well, the room is

239
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.150
Daniel Guerrero: Like a small room.

240
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.600
Daniel Guerrero: inside the room there's a

241
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.150
Daniel Guerrero: Of course, a bed.

242
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.660
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe I don't maybe a TV.

243
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, gotcha.

244
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon as you're in their servants, imagine sort of as much as you're comfortable closing your eyes, try to picture the walls, trying to picture what you see as you scan.

245
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: The landscape of this room looking for me, left to right. What's over on your left when you see the colors, the texture. What do you notice

246
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.350
Daniel Guerrero: It's white and color and it's like

247
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.590
Daniel Guerrero: I know like plastered is not like

248
00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, like

249
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.280
Daniel Guerrero: plastered paint. Yep.

250
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Posture white wall. I got it.

251
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any thing on the walls, besides the posture. Wait.

252
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, any windows in there.

253
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.480
And

254
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice on the ceiling.

255
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.300
Daniel Guerrero: Ceiling Fan

256
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:25.740
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

257
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What about the floor.

258
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.810
Daniel Guerrero: What floor like you know like

259
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: wood floor, dark, light bamboo what you got.

260
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.770
Daniel Guerrero: Light Brown.

261
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Light Brown.

262
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, turn your attention to a different sense. Let's turn it to auditory, which is your hearing. When should you be in this room.

263
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.790
And what to hear

264
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.910
Daniel Guerrero: Is silence.

265
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Silence

266
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, let's go to another sense

267
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of tactile what is quarto feel, what do you feel it's kind of this combination don't overanalyze it. What do you feel when you're in this room. What is maybe the hands, they might be touching something feeling something. What do they do they feel in there.

268
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.350
Daniel Guerrero: There's a they don't feel anything. There's no emotion, there's

269
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No emotion and and so yeah those are emotions. What about tactile so right now notice. Let's do a real one. What do you feel your hands are touching. Maybe your thighs right now for your hips, something like that describe what you feel that's tactile that's touch you feel

270
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.180
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

271
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.370
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know.

272
00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.130
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel my jeans.

273
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

274
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great. I told you these questions are very goofy.

275
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So and jeans, you certainly know them as jeans versus slacks. Pay attention to the temperature of those jeans.

276
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice if there's any bumps ridges, if they change from, you know, if I if I'm over here to the left. I can feel there's a CD more or less pocket or see if you notice just pay close attention to tactile

277
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And can you get a sense of any bumps on the jeans.

278
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.500
Daniel Guerrero: Right, I can do it like

279
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.220
Daniel Guerrero: You know, as I as I show for my hands up and down. I could feel like my jeans like rolling with my hands.

280
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.780
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

281
00:35:46.890 --> 00:36:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So now in this room. That's what I'm referring to as the tactile. So when I say feel, it'll be like body feel if I say emotion. That'll be happy, sad Mad, Glad jealous, it will be in motion. Right.

282
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So inside this room. What does Gordo sense with his skin. What is he feeling, what does he notice texture and temperature, what's in there.

299
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about a taste. And that's probably the hardest one to get to

300
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:38.550
Taste.

Okay.

Daniel Guerrero: It's a door with that you know that has hinges, the door is

311
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.050
Daniel Guerrero: So black door.

312
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.670
What's it made of

313
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.390
Daniel Guerrero: It's all would

314
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.270
Daniel Guerrero: Handle to come inside.

315
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Any locking system.

316
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.840
Daniel Guerrero: Devil.

317
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: inside the room or outside the room.

318
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:47.850
Daniel Guerrero: Opens

319
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: both inside and outside or both on your inside

320
00:38:53.910 --> 00:39:03.630
Daniel Guerrero: Of yeah both both ends. It's like key, key and then unlock on the inside. So you had to come in with the key and you have to lock it.

321
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: In this key and dead, both on the inside bolted on the inside, right, got it. Okay.

322
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And get a sense of whether that door is open or closed now.

323
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that comes to mind.

324
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.900
Daniel Guerrero: It's closed. Yeah, close

325
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it locked

326
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.180
Yes.

327
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how you want to catch him quick his mind will start to question whether that first response, try and catch them as quick as you can. As soon as I get the next invitation. You're doing amazing

328
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have that's beautiful, and

329
00:39:47.490 --> 00:40:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now turn back into this room and I want you to now pay attention to the song right I was talking about the body before wants you to see how you're doing in there is the body activated. Is there any tension just sort of do a nice light body scan, see how we're doing in there.

330
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.740
Daniel Guerrero: I'm doing fine. I'm just, you know, looking around the room just

331
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about in there.

332
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.600
Blank.

333
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:23.220
Okay.

334
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotion, any, any emotion that you're aware of

335
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.080
Daniel Guerrero: Exhausted.

336
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

337
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is a neat room because it can have magic so off on the wall, you might have a secret little compartment or your imagination come can come up with a with another way to kind of have this magic in there.

338
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But that exhaustion.

339
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Can transform that can be something where you get all of your needs met, everything that you need is there for you all the resources that you need and check in and see if you want to be exhausted in there.

340
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Go. Hmm, okay. So just imagine

341
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that would help that exhaustion. What would be needed or what would something that would need to go in order for that exhaustion to transform

342
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.800
Daniel Guerrero: Somebody would be near to go

343
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.740
Daniel Guerrero: I think maybe

344
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.870
Daniel Guerrero: Some compassion.

345
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you get it in that room.

346
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so still you're feeling the exhaustion. Right.

347
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:56.430
Okay.

348
00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is magic.

349
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's tap into some of the stuff that we've toyed with before, which is now remember Gordo can remember maybe grandma.

350
00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:11.610
Right.

351
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a bear protecting are called and she was a safe haven and also the lion right remembering that and

352
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.570
Daniel Guerrero: I'm sorry going somebody was trying to call me to cut you out.

353
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. I'm just trying to include the three, the team that protective figure that nurturing figure in the wise figure

354
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.230
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, I'm gonna give me one second. I had to, I don't know what happened to my phone. It's like super silent.

355
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.480
Daniel Guerrero: Oh joy quick

356
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's because someone call just turn your turn your mute on and off. It should snap it back to where it was.

357
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's because someone called Test test test test test test test.

358
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Test.

359
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:57.690
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

360
00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:58.590
Yeah.

361
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:02.340
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

362
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.800
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, yeah.

363
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:06.030
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

364
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

365
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: For a second I want you to picture your team.

366
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, Grandma.

367
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Both as a protective figure and as a as having that quality of wanting you to grow and develop

368
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: As well as wise.

369
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: He gave you good advice. She taught you to pray and believe in the Lord in Jesus Christ.

370
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: See if that is what Gordo needs and wants. See if that's helping with the compassion. That's what the unmet need is in there.

371
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.430
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, it's kind of crazy to say that because

372
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:06.690
Daniel Guerrero: When I was when I was telling you these things. It's like that's what was hitting on you know because

373
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:15.270
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I wasn't able to be around my grandma that much because of my step dad being who he was.

374
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.010
Daniel Guerrero: As well.

375
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:25.410
Daniel Guerrero: When I did get that time with her, you know, because that's where the comfort was that's where you know

376
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:35.370
Daniel Guerrero: The compassion came from, you know, because my mom wasn't allowed you to love me the way she wanted me to be done.

377
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.340
Daniel Guerrero: Because of him, you know,

378
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And

379
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:42.690
Daniel Guerrero: That's

380
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.690
Daniel Guerrero: I don't practice in my home, you know,

381
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:52.620
Daniel Guerrero: My kids, you know, have a problem or something. For an example, especially my older kids, you know,

382
00:44:53.760 --> 00:45:04.470
Daniel Guerrero: You know they don't come to. They don't come to me, you know, and I tell them all available and they're just like, I feel more comfortable talking to mom or whatever. And I'm good.

383
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.050
Daniel Guerrero: I'm

384
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:20.130
Daniel Guerrero: Like, then you know I wasn't we weren't able to express how we fail to say, you know, I don't think this is rider. I think that's wrong. And this is why

385
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.500
Daniel Guerrero: I'm

386
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:43.200
Daniel Guerrero: You know, growing up, you know, in that environment, you know, was pretty damaging for me because I have some of the traits you know that were given. And you know, I feel I did. I'm carrying them not a one to carry on. Yeah.

387
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what we're up to you. Did you just did great today. So notice how right we're using you know you allowed you trusted me even though you

388
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have a long history of knowing me you're trusting

389
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That this is going to work, that there's going to be some positive experience from this and definitely always trying to get you to more calm more self acceptance to more love always that's guiding all of the interventions that I'm going to bring okay and

390
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We're about. We're going to stop because we're kind of at the top of the hour goes by really fast, doesn't it.

391
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.810
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. And I mean, I know this is my fault. I will not

392
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.330
Daniel Guerrero: Because, you know, I really enjoy the sessions with you.

393
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:38.400
Daniel Guerrero: Know, because, like, it's like my time, you know, it's my time. You know, I don't have to answer to nobody, or why do you think like

394
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.910
Daniel Guerrero: You know what I mean. And I don't

395
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:56.070
Daniel Guerrero: Know, and so you know it's a way for me. Another way to express myself in. And, you know, and find answers to, you know what, what's really going on, what's really going on in here. You know what I mean.

396
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:57.990
Daniel Guerrero: So, thank you.

397
00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a very good fit for psychotherapy, you don't have a lot of what I would call a defenses up so you're, you're, you're probably going to benefit quite a bit from it. I'm excited for you really um yeah yeah

398
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not letting the lack of having known me for years getting the way. Or maybe you think I'm up to something bad or something. You're not letting

399
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Typical defenses, get in the way and that's really smart for you're going to get along or and a lot faster. So we got about, I would say.

400
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A third of the way through this activity.

401
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, about a third. So it doesn't mean you know that we won't be able to to kind of move all the way through it next time. But I do want to come back to it. If nothing big is going on.

402
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say, Hey, let's and what I may do is I'll read. I'll bring you back to that room. I'll read some of the things that you shared will go back there and then we'll do more of the work that's involved. Okay.

403
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another time to meet

404
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.900

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.170
Daniel Guerrero: Yes.

407
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought we switched it so that you didn't have to. We didn't switch it yet.

408
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:23.730
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know.

409
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're out of your out of medicine. I don't know. I don't keep track of it. All I do is send a message to the doctor saying, hey, so and so showed up.

410
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:38.280
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, I have I have enough medicine until, until Monday.

411
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, then you're fine. You're fine. Yeah, good. Yeah, cuz that's what you wanted, and

412
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So we

413
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.860
Daniel Guerrero: Got away because my insurance was they were not wanting like they were making me wait

414
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:56.970
Daniel Guerrero: Okay. So whenever you guys would send me a script, say for example you sent it today, it would let you tomorrow.

415
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's probably because you still have some left is my guess. Okay.

416
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.060
Daniel Guerrero: So,

417
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be really key is that you take the exact dose that's prescribed. If you take too much of run out the insurance won't want to pay for it, etc. Right now, you read every week.

418
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And that will stay that way. As long as your sort of showing up for for this part where you show up for these appointments. Okay, so just keep doing what you're doing. We had a little glitch today, but that's the first time really that's happened so I'm not worried

419
00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's schedule another time.
