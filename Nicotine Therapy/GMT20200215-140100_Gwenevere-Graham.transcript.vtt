00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.190
ATM.

2
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
Can make a note, hopefully, Cindy and Scott will be here.

3
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning you there.

4
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning. Morning. Morning.

5
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see you.

6
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.470
Are you there.

7
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not in a car.

8
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.650
Nick Graham: No, I'm in my office. I'm actually trying to join the computer so

9
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I

10
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.540
Nick Graham: Can you see

11
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time. I'm going to go open up a note. Don't feel hurry.

12
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.860
Okay.

13
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.830
Nick Graham: 765806

14
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, you're going to probably get a BP sound. If you have two devices next to each other just prepare yourself, it'll really

15
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.280
Nick Graham: So I don't know if you see it on your end, or how, how, exactly. I don't really know.

16
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll see two logins, that's what I'll see when I when I see a second one, trying to get in and then you're going to want to get off of the one that you don't want to be on because it'll be about you. So your piercing

17
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I you'll know right away.

18
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.530
Nick Graham: Oh,

19
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.800
Nick Graham: Yeah, it says it's asking. It's like logging and now I don't really know. So maybe it's

20
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, maybe I don't see you yet. I'll see two entries

21
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see to have your names pop up over in my little weight area. I only see this one at this point.

22
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.080
Nick Graham: 765830613 to

23
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Add it

24
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alternatively, you could log out of this one and just login this other spot.

25
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.280
Nick Graham: I think it might be, I guess I'll just have to do not computer because this computer sometimes fails to

26
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.060
Nick Graham: Like launch zoom interviews, because I do interviews at work and stuff to it was. Uh huh.

27
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.620
Nick Graham: I don't know. It seems like it's not working.

28
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.920
Nick Graham: Because if you're not seeing it now, then I don't know when you ever would see

29
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.380
Nick Graham: This

30
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.970
Nick Graham: Movie.

31
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.940
Nick Graham: Yeah, Sunday, we'll get there.

32
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But you use that app for interviews as well the zoom

33
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you know when it's not working. And when it is

34
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.830
Nick Graham: Correct to be just not be now.

35
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're just on your phone and today.

36
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.210
Nick Graham: I'm still gonna try with it.

37
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.750
Nick Graham: Let's see. But in the meantime, I can just do it this way because

38
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.500
Nick Graham: I'm not very good at doing this stuff.

39
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the technologies, it's not a perfect system it's dependent on you know a lot of factors here. I don't think it's it's you.

40
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.540
Nick Graham: Yeah, I wonder. Also, you can only get certain

41
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.400
Nick Graham: Meeting IDs associated with when it wouldn't make any sense. I don't know. I don't know how bright heart tracks like

42
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.750
Nick Graham: When

43
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, for example, I work with families and I'll work with a spouse and they just grab a login. They have an app on their phone. I just got it and I give them my my number and they just log in. It's, it's, yeah, it's pretty seamless so so might be just something going on.

44
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: With that particular computer somehow but you try once you try it one time. Just take a deep breath, log out here.

45
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And they start from scratch on your computer. We might like the just do one more big push to see if it

46
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.130
Nick Graham: Works.

47
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or no pressure on you. You just just

48
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.160
Read

49
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.640
Nick Graham: Again computer they tried to

50
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a little bit of a cushion because my next next appointment cancelled. So, you know, the back to back isn't quite happening. So I've got a little bit of breathing room. Okay.

51
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.880
Cool.

52
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to want to get off in this other device.

53
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.590
Okay.

54
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go to add our connection.

55
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's nice about this is I can use the light on this one. And we don't have to rely on on these objects, but we do need to set the distance again.

56
00:06:48.030 --> 00:07:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I guess it's probably going to strain your eyes a touch. So you may want to move back about, I don't know, maybe three five inches. Yeah. Probably be like that. So let me. I did open up a note, while you've been kind of getting everything ready

57
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But why don't we come to just present time. Just, just do a quick little observation about what came up for you over these last couple days.

58
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.510
I'm

59
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.530
Nick: Really nothing. Nothing much. I guess it was Thursday since then.

60
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.650
Just

61
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.550
Nothing like I don't know. I'm trying to let me let me like to reach for it.

62
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.670
Nick: I've been like working like really long days. So I haven't really like how old

63
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.750
But it's time to like reflect. Uh huh.

64
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, that's good. Right. We want someone who's not in

65
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good thing. Yeah. Um,

66
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And sort of looking on an emotional level, how has your irritability, Ben, how has a quick sleep.

67
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been refer your inability

68
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.290
Nick: Yeah, that's been

69
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.990
Substantially

70
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: More like President. Okay, so, irritability, has been there.

71
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.650
Nick: Yeah, it's been there.

72
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a

73
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.300
Nick: Little things like like you literally witness three minutes ago.

74
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, something right some frustration with with the self, like you should be going fast or this should right yeah

75
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.040
It comes from

76
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.930
Nick: Be a little things like like that.

77
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:51.570
Nick: Like yesterday I specifically happened when I had like we had to deliver a bunch of stuff to the mayor's office. And so I had like 20 minutes in this deadline to meet

78
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.620
Nick: And like I handled it well, but I was like everyone who's trying to talk to me. I was like, just don't talk to me right now. Like, it's just

79
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:10.800
Nick: So I was feeling like frustrated in like angry and that's that's the thing that happens to me like sometimes too outrageous.

80
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.220
Anger for no reason.

81
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So now what you just described. You're labeling it outrageous anger. But what I heard in the story was just don't talk to me right now. So what now is that what outrageous anger is. I mean, let's see.

82
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.250
Nick: I feel inside. Yes, like the anger is like, like how

83
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.940
Nick: See those papers on the floor.

84
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

85
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:46.650
Nick: I like was trying to figure out the printer. In addition to putting like without having any printed thousand petition pages. I like

86
00:09:48.180 --> 00:10:01.560
Nick: Just like papers would print out. Nothing was on it. No, just like throw them like angrily on the ground. You know, like, like, I don't know how normal it is probably normal to be upset, but sometimes like when I'm in that moment, I'm just like so mad.

87
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that that gives me a better understanding

88
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

89
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how far into it, do you catch mean there's lots of different ways to do that. I think I'm getting frustrated is a normal human reaction. How far into it, do you catch it. Do you stop. How long does that last that

90
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.730
That

91
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.440
Nick: Depends on

92
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:40.530
Nick: Like what's happening, like so, like for example yesterday there was no time to stop and think about anything because I had

93
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.920
Nick: So much to do, like, well, let me think. Hold on, I think there was a point, let me try to

94
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.960
Okay.

95
00:10:50.280 --> 00:11:00.840
Nick: So there was a point when I like stopped and said like no matter what, like this will get done. Let me think of the creative solution and I wound up like having to email.

96
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.170
So I did think about it.

97
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing.

98
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.680
Probably

99
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Three to five minutes in. Okay, like panic mode.

100
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm imagining. You can picture there are people that it takes a lot longer and that could have spiraled into yelling at people right and you, you know, you end up getting written up or canned or even worse, arrested. I mean, it can get can go pretty far where you

101
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know your your sense of urgency and importance of turning this in

102
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The media is blown out of proportion. Now, I'm not trying to minimize whatever it was this task and how how much was contingent on it.

103
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did catch it after three or four minutes and you use sort of that rational mind which is I know this will get done. I just gotta kind of be creative with this.

104
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.190
Nick: Yeah, the thing that I guess like anytime I think about any kind of

105
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:25.290
Nick: Stupid like just use a different word anytime I think about sometimes when I'm like acting irrational air reminds me of the times when I like actually freak out. And so it's like, I don't like that.

106
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.290
Nick: I don't like that same feeling of like

107
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:37.440
Nick: blood rushing to my head like short like shallow breathing and it's like even, like, though, that wasn't a big deal. And I believe I handled it well like I

108
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:49.080
Nick: Compared to like a lot of people like that might be in our again like current leadership in my office like this you know someone who's like ridiculous and yelled at me for not ordering the correct pizza. The

109
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Day.

110
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.110
Nick: For her that I'm supposed to. So

111
00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:02.580
Nick: I believe that I didn't like take it out on people, but he reminds me of times when I do okay people. I like care about that too I mainly freak out.

112
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe we can do a little discovery around that and some change around that.

113
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's it's it's not the direction of depression response. It's a direction of sympathetic nervous system, which is elevated heart rate and I'm guessing right they

114
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The rational mind the executive functioning, you're not thinking straight. You're really in that emotion and that's it. You're all limbic

115
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you probably. Yeah, you're probably thinking of some image or some memory that just really embodies or constitutes one of those just embarrassing or like

116
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I just can't believe that was me i can i just regret what I did. Maybe tell me that one. And if you don't want to tell me if it's so embarrassing for you, then you just have to think about it. Maybe we can do some desensitisation around

117
00:13:59.640 --> 00:13:59.760
But

118
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell it, whatever. Okay, go for it because it can feel good to cut

119
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.190
My hiding, you know,

120
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.430
Nick: Yeah, yeah. Well, for example, the other night like when I freaked out on my ex, and then

121
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:28.350
Nick: That was one and then the time before when I freaked out on her and then the time before. And, you know, like many like countless times I've done similar responses.

122
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's most. A lot of them are to to Sydney

123
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:43.500
Nick: And others like yeah, also to like I've done it to like I've looked for data. My mom as well because I get it from her, like, well, I probably I get it from myself but she has taught me.

124
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.320
Nick: Like the ways of speaking horrible things in anger, you know, so

125
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: She modeled it, it sounds like

126
00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A better word. And so she may not have been, I don't know, may not have also or maybe she has maybe you can scan some history. Has she also modeled sort of that temperance. NET Ability to

127
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Channel those intense emotions somewhere else and to have thought it through managing sort of impulse control does she model, any of that seemed really

128
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Convenient because anybody else model that where you know you can kind of look to it in your in your imagination and sort of picture. Oh boy, I'm looking at this person. And what I would have freaked out. Look at how how they're handling that that's

129
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.730
Like

130
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.110
Well, I'm kind of thinking a personal setting when that when that happens.

131
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:58.020
Nick: I don't know. Yeah, I mean, somewhere that I could scour my brain for 10 minutes but

132
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't you go maybe it is easier at in the workplace. Has there ever been someone that you sort of admire kind of how they maintain their composure with grace. No pressure.

133
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.290
Used to

134
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:23.910
Nick: They used to work. I guess like no recent a guy used to work here. And he would, he would do that he would like step would be like burning down around him and he would just smile through it.

135
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.440
He was like,

136
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.800
So that those that's pretty solid for him to be able to do that.

137
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And burning down. Now, if he had to hurry on a short timeline to get something printed. Is that an example of burning down and he would have handled it in a without you. Thank you.

138
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Could have handled that. Like, like, well, I think, like, ultimately, I feel as though I handled it well, but

139
00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:07.890
Nick: whatever was going on inside that that that was like the internal like frustration. That's what I'm like, like maybe everyone has that or maybe people can like really just breathe through stuff and they're fine with it. I don't know.

140
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so, because what you did mention about this guy. Is that what you saw was in smiling, but you don't know what he was going through inside. Right, exactly.

141
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

142
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you more interested in a less distressed internal experience.

143
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.220
Nick: Because that's what leads to the external is like a like a tea kettle. You know, like

144
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:47.580
It comes up inside and then it just goes on. Usually, whoever I love is who I like shower with like

145
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.890
Nick: Pence. Yeah. Terrible things. Yeah.

146
00:17:54.150 --> 00:18:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, those are the people that unconsciously. We know love us and aren't gonna leave. It's a weird thing that we do.

147
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But normal nonetheless. They do leave until, until they do.

148
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll, we'll leave the the analysis aside for for a while. Why don't we get a little bit to

149
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do with doing the work. So let's go back go back in time to you know how he were saying

150
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to your own recollection of meeting.

151
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: A frustration is what it is like it's a I can't, I can't either immediately solve something I don't have the resources, the information the skill set.

152
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can go back to the earliest event that might take time. So don't hurry it it's most useful if we can find that one and all, all sort of go along with you. I won't be staring at your sort of do it myself where you you couldn't couldn't couldn't

153
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Get this this solution and you ended up acting out right. That's an acting out to tossing of papers or breaking an object or

154
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.410
Or

155
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: yelling at someone right we're acting out I didn't solve the problem, probably worse. And it but that's all that was left to you as a solution. So try and go back. I'm going to shut up.

156
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can find the earliest one

157
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:18.480
Nick: I can remember like times when I would like punch through walls and like, stuff like that. But I cannot remember the circumstances surrounding them as

158
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. I think that's a pretty profound act out to punch through a wall disregard for your own physical well being. It's property that's that's a real sense of

159
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Of helpless to solve this in any other way. So let's go to one of those just one of those images seem like a pretty intense one

160
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, I would think so. Okay, and what he does that put me up.

161
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.960
Nick: It was like maybe 15 but I guess like I don't know. I used to like

162
00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Act down much more strange way. So I don't know if it'd be worth mentioning, like let's let's see what she can split my family like laughs

163
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:08.070
Nick: At but like not I'm thinking about. It's like I was in New Hampshire visiting my dad when I was like seven or eight

164
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:17.310
Nick: And I, something came up like my mom would always like, call us when we were with her dad and get us like mad.

165
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right ruin the whole thing. Yeah, and

166
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:36.810
Nick: So I don't know, I, you know, I guess I can't specifically tied to that. So that's just like a general blame for no reason. But so I got mad at like my dad for IT SOME KIND OF IT WAS ALWAYS issues surrounding like

167
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.640
Nick: Whatever him like leaving in. And so we got mad and if I and I like I like ran off into the woods.

168
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.320
And I like

169
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:57.030
Nick: Covered myself and berries like like it like a Native American like like in a weird, like I like smash berries and like covered myself and then like

170
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:10.650
Nick: I kind of just acted out in like a really crazy like strange like they were like on a walk like my dad and stepmom to like walk off whatever. And I was like, following them through the woods like with berries like covering me like it was like

171
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:21.150
Nick: They like it was like funny. And I think at a certain point, I was like, oh, let me just like this is like funny. Let me be funny about this, but I'll probably be the first time. Okay.

172
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um let's lift labels of it and see what's there without the labels of funny. Strange. So let's lift those because I certainly don't have them. Okay. Yeah, this is a very young boy I'm

173
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to communicate something

174
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.060
Nick: Yes, I just covered yeah just made berries all over myself and like ran through the woods. Yeah.

175
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the picture I originally had was that you are visiting your father.

176
00:22:54.390 --> 00:23:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And that your mother was remote and only could reach through sabotaging made me through a call to disrupt the meeting, but then all of a sudden they were walking together. I didn't know how those two things went together so

177
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.930
Nick: Well, she she would frequently do that when we would like go out there like sometimes

178
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:18.540
That's like one time she like like the time and my brother punched her it was after a call. You know, like, like punch my step mom.

179
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.680
Nick: Because she would like call and say stuff like that sometimes, but

180
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.860
Nick: I the anger, I cannot pinpoint it originally like directly originating from a call.

181
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and they're not okay. No, I was just maybe I got mom versus step mom next next

182
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.360
Nick: step mom and dad were walking up

183
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

184
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you. That's all I just, I'm in Denver long since divorce, like maybe like a few us. Okay.

185
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So again, if it's okay we'll lift yeah will lift the judgment about it. I certainly don't I have a very deep curiosity about

186
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How that was helping you adapt.

187
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To them paradox was going on.

188
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't know that.

189
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: coming at it with sitting here, analyzing it is going to get us there. So I do want to do the stuff that you can have that distraction going on and just let

190
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let let information come in just nice and easy, without hammering at it and forcing it and which is what sort of cognitive behavioral therapy does

191
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's be gentle. Let's really be gentle. Because I know I'm having a really strong reaction to that really feeling for that little boy.

192
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

193
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: For you right now as you as you you know how I do. And I say, well, let's bring up that image and

194
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And the worst part of it, you know, whether it's

195
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere with that call. And I don't want to guide you in any way of where that is. But the worst image of that experience.

196
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That picture.

197
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you feel it. Now I want to do a check in and how distressed you are and you know now about those sides that 02 hundred where you have to pat

198
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.290
Nick: Yeah, like I don't

199
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Digest probably like 20 like 2020 ok so maybe willing to work on it. It's not going to overwhelm. Yeah.

200
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.460
Nick: Yeah, no, not, not, not at all. Okay. Okay.

201
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.060
Excellent.

202
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, if it's more intense. It'll. I just want to make sure I'm taking care of you. Okay.

203
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got a tight chest and you can hold it there and let's label, it's important we get all of the parts of the brain communicating with each other because the problem was, in some ways, they weren't. Okay.

204
00:25:53.010 --> 00:26:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get a label. Let's use the language. And let's see if we can label is seven year olds emotion.

205
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Around that imagery would be

206
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.110
Are probably like a frustration is an emotion.

207
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.540
Definitely frustration.

208
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.770
And

209
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.640
Some kind of intense sadness. I don't know if I

210
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly an intense something and sadness and frustration.

211
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.570
Yeah.

212
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.790
Nick: It was like always, like, a

213
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:53.970
Don't think yeah so there was like always an underlying feeling of like betrayal that was like a thing that was ever present

214
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just taking some notes.

215
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's go there and let's do one more piece.

216
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a

217
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Little guy.

218
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can tap into what the belief about yourself is

219
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And of course, you find it through the I Am.

220
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling worried. We've covered that as that.

221
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you can get there.

222
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.940
I would say

223
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.810
I am

224
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.340
I would say misunderstood.

225
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.640
That was a unique expression like

226
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels really true check on your chest. See if there's real congruency there I misunderstood, see if that's the

227
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Betrayal frustration intense sadness and. And here, this, this, this is how I'm going to address the frustration.

228
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:51.930
Well, I think.

229
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:53.880
I might want to

230
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.250
revisit that because

231
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I think misunderstood would be like how I view it from my current lens like okay

232
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.570
Nick: I doubt back then. I probably felt well I probably felt like there's something not being communicated

233
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can go there again and and what's ok but what you notice now is I'm I misunderstood.

234
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's. Why don't we actually go without and see, see where this takes us. Okay.

235
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

236
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to know ahead of time before we know

237
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to share the screen with you and these these first iterations. I'd like to do some desensitization. So don't be surprised if

238
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: The distress increases before it decreases, but the ultimate goal is desensitization. Okay. And then we can move into the more positive ones.

239
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I know you've, you've really benefited from the positive ones. I don't know that we've done a lot of this desensitisation part. So let's let's give that a try.

240
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: They're a little faster. Whoops. You can't see this yet how to share my screen there. A little faster with with the negative of a little slower with the positive installing so that's a bunch of em Dr jargon.

241
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget about that.

242
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let me know. It's a little faster. All right, let me share the screen here, clunk, clunk, clunk.

243
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, people have seemed to like this little blue light. So I've been sticking with this one.

244
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.430
Share

245
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Screen.

246
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so let me, let me first take a look at your eyes. And so I can see if there. They've got a nice comfortable movement left and right.

247
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not straining

248
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's fine. Okay. Alright. Cool, cool. So

249
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Start from and notice how it's kind of fast right a little faster than normal. So this is the exercise. What I want you to do. I want you to pull up the worst image.

250
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that walk right of that that imagery and

251
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm misunderstood.

252
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'm gonna ask you to breathe, and then I'm going to briefly check in and be very careful to catch what's coming up, you'll share it with me and we'll probably do a few more. Okay.

253
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So worst part of that picture and I am misunderstood.

254
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just looking at for this left and right.

255
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together, inhale through the nose. Nice belly breath.

256
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

257
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling letting it go

258
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

259
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:54.960
Nick: It really does like

260
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:56.910
Nick: I remember like

261
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.830
Taking off like ran out the front door into the woods like

262
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.870
My family like they were like kind of looking for me. And I remember just like

263
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:14.070
I took my, I think it was like my clothes off like my shirt. My under my shirt my pants off. And I was like in my underwear.

264
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:15.930
Nick: And I just remember like

265
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.000
Watching them walk and like feeling this like like angry like

266
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:31.380
Nick: Like kind of super sad like just staring like out of them like walking up this hill somewhere in New Hampshire.

267
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So feeling angry super sad. Yeah, it really angry and like I'm

268
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.240
Like I wanted to like walk out there like in like

269
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.270
See like talk to them, but

270
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.360
I didn't even I finally did a host like

271
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.590
Like running like making like

272
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:05.130
Nick: Like Native American war cries kind of sound like indian war cries.

273
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold down. I wanted to have walked out to them, but I didn't. And then later.

274
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We presented in that way. Hold that worst image.

275
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, the most distressing piece of that the most intense and I misunderstood.

276
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's watch this.

277
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Bilateral

278
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Awareness.

279
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly breath. Breathe it in all the way down the bottom of the long and the exhale

280
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go

281
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And share. When you're ready,

282
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.840
Yes, just them.

283
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.610
In I think most distressing would be

284
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.950
Like pulling the

285
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.270
Nick: Foliage apart and, like, just like watching them like walk up the hill.

286
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're pulling the foliage and they're walking up the hill.

287
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the most distressing.

288
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.350
Nick: Yeah, I think so.

289
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.940
It can't remember the root of what happened though.

290
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And

291
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I am misunderstood.

292
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for sure.

293
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do this again. Let's go with that.

294
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: First part Western contents image there, and I misunderstood.

295
00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together.

296
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

297
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

298
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch that awareness as it passes by can be in the body and emotion, a thought for a belief. I think they probably walked,

299
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:29.430
Either I believe they walked to like like went on the walk to like find me probably

300
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.500
Only thing I can think of right now.

301
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.150
Super like emotionally charged or anything.

302
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How's the chest.

303
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:08.700
Nick: Chest is fine. It's kind of like expanded like whatever was going on is like dispersed between like chest and like down to like stomach.

304
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's expanded. Now, it kind of like moved

305
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.400
Nick: Yeah, like, move but like like

306
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.030
Disseminated

307
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.850
And intense like an intensity. It was like one little tight area now it's kind of like spread

308
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Mm hmm disseminated and spread

309
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To not just the stomach.

310
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.260
Nick: At a way lower magnitude

311
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, lower okay well let's let's go with fat, pay attention to that attend to that awareness tuning into it, paying attention into the viscera.

312
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding that worst thought that worse image. The Worst Picture.

313
00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I misunderstood.

314
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a nice deep breath. I wasn't too far off, we only had about 510 seconds left.

315
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So just pay attention. It's okay. Just pay attention to you. Well, that's life. It goes on. There's interruptions. It's the way it is. Yeah.

316
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to you to see what you notice, including the call. It's okay.

317
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.650
Nick: Yeah, it's like it kind of seems like

318
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.110
Nick: As like a wave of

319
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.410
Calm like washes over me. It goes like

320
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.630
From, like,

321
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:43.050
Nick: Like test like a chest ball like and it's feels like it just goes lower like like washes down, sort of, uh huh. That's like a

322
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.960
Kind of released a physical

323
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.310
Characteristic that I'm like noticing. Okay.

324
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What emotion that you're feeling right now.

325
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.440
I don't know what a

326
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.950
Nick: So so emotion is like, I'm kind of

327
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a small amount of one or another. So just

328
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.070
Nick: Yeah, calm calm.

329
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And your body is it also relaxed or the muscles relax or the viscera is there.

330
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

331
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what about in the stomach, what's what. Is there any charge in there. Now, it kind of like

332
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.840
Nick: Like, I guess.

333
00:41:51.540 --> 00:42:05.070
Nick: As it goes away. It feels like like drinking warm tea and you know you can like kind of feel it, like, just like go all the way down. Yeah, that's kind of what happens like whatever the feeling like the tense feeling

334
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.620
Like goes down.

335
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.760
As though. It's just being like

336
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:25.500
Just like washed down in like a not intense sort of way, just like goes away. Like it just sit down and like my like a lower like abdomen. Okay.

337
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's go with that in lower abdomen.

338
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's pull that image up again worst part.

339
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I misunderstood.

340
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding it in your working memory right now.

341
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding it there as long as she can.

342
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathe in together. Nice. Inhale.

343
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

344
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

345
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to turn to yourself.

346
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me what shifts changes. What's your awareness is

347
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.880
The word like

348
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.160
Mistrust like comes up, like I don't know in what context.

349
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:10.860
Or in one sense, but

350
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.170
That word is like

351
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And are you noticing, it's, it's also there's a charge in the body with that word.

352
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:34.290
Nick: So whatever that this is kind of like

353
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:38.700
President in like

354
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.270
Like tight stomach lining of the stomach like like working its way back

355
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok now.

356
00:44:52.650 --> 00:45:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that feeling. And I want you to. Now, see, see if there's another memory. You can earlier even more intense of mistrust and that that stomach sensation that stomach being charged

357
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.040
Nick: Chronologically I can't really

358
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: nothing's coming up specifically knows particular nothing I can like, think of earlier like

359
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:12.780
Nick: I remember like my former stepfather that like I remembered not trusting him. He was like a giant dig.

360
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And how old were you at that time, and even around the same age of seven.

361
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:37.680
Nick: Okay. It was like recent think very soon after my parents divorced my mom like remarried. This guy because she wanted us to have a father figure. She says, and married him like very quickly. Any stuff. Okay.

362
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And what emotion goes with this one.

363
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.220
Probably

364
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.950
Nick: At this point, probably

365
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:19.290
Confusion like

366
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.830
Nick: Yeah, like, for some reason, they're like,

367
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.980
Nick: Kind of triggered like really fucked up memory.

368
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so something you've got some memory effective shit that I like, forgot existed. Okay, so we got unthinking age seven ish

369
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:45.240
Nick: Yeah yeah my. Oh, fuck yeah.

370
00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You can choose to tell me or or just hold it. What do you want to do.

371
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.710
Nick: Yeah. No, I'm cool with telling, it's just

372
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

373
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Us let your body know that that's in the past.

374
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not now. Okay.

375
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a lot more resources you're you're with someone that cares about you.

376
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:32.850
Okay.

377
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But that energy that fucked up shit yeah can still be running some of the decisions about your current life and and maybe our work together, we can we can change its meaning we can put it in the past and leave it there so it doesn't have any influence or intrusion on your current life.

378
00:48:58.890 --> 00:48:59.970
Yeah.

379
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.650
So I'd have to like

380
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.750
Probably put it to words.

381
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.320
Nick: So,

382
00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.020
Nick: I was probably

383
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.030
Six or seven and at the time I had

384
00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.870
A step sister. She was one year older than me.

385
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.770
Nick: I just didn't brother who was two years older than me.

386
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.730
Nick: And an older stepbrother it was maybe

387
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.720
Three years older than me and

388
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.330
Nick: Wow, man is a bunch of shit so

389
00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.000
Nick: My sister. Sister at the time.

390
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.130
I remember my like brother like called me in and he was like

391
00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.730
Nick: Hey, like, look at this and like

392
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.190
She was like, he like he was like

393
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Was he hurting her. Yeah.

394
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah Oh honey, I'm so, so sorry. Oh, that's so confusing.

395
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So hurtful to everyone.

396
00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:29.310
Yeah, she's probably

397
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: She's probably affected by that, too. Oh, yeah. I hope she's getting some help.

398
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.110
Us like encouraging like

399
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.570
Nick: He like he like calling all the brothers and he was like, hey, like, look here like

400
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:58.950
Nick: That's your whatever it was, like, oh, like, my heart is like like obvious saying like, what the fuck

401
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.950
But also, like,

402
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.870
She's like probably

403
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.100
If I'm old enough to remember she's old enough to remember

404
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But she's just she's getting care. Okay, we're taking care of you. You don't have to feel for her. We're going to take care of you. That was fucked up.

405
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And so confusing for a little boy.

406
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: He's bigger than you.

407
00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you to do. Yeah.

408
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you did you get to tell anybody. No, I never did ever. I like

409
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.100
Maybe fleetingly thought of it.

410
00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:04.230
Nick: I would probably wager to say like whatever this is, you know, like therapy stuff you're trained to do, like, I don't know if that's like a thing that people like repress things and like under certain circumstances, they come out but

411
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is normal. This definitely

412
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

413
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you noticing me because you're not doing this alone. Can you tell that I care. Yeah, okay. Okay, good.

414
00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:21.690
Good.

415
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to your tummy goes there, Nick, just go there.

416
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And feel that I care for you.

417
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And that you're not wrong, what was going on around you was wrong.

418
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Illegal wrong and should have been stopped immediately and everyone in that room needed professional help.

419
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone was crying out and saying there's something really wrong with our family system and all these kids.

420
00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Were smearing berries on themselves just trying to make sense of an absolutely crazy confusing life.

421
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, young people just try to solve the problem. The best way they know cow.

422
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be utterly confusing for you.

423
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No one to tell

424
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, how do you weren't that to a mother.

425
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How to word that to a stepfather, who's a deck. This is right, just where do you go to not go crazy.

426
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's your refuge.

427
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.100
Right.

428
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:52.170
Good question.

429
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:54.780
Yeah.

430
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:56.670
Yeah.

431
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's bring in, let's bring in these positive images with this. Okay, let's have some some good stuff get into this network that hasn't been visited maybe for a long time, or very rarely

432
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you, do you have access to pulling up those those positive images. Those your figures you bring them into your mind or do you want me to go in and note remind Jeff.

433
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:33.960
Nick: Yeah, got it.

434
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Now this this iteration is going to be much slower. Okay, they're going to be, it's going to be a slower movement and I want to add something else to

435
00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do it after let's first get all the yummy and the and the safe nurturing and wisdom present. Okay, let's do that first. Then we'll go into this other cognitive stuff.

436
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And what just stress level are you at right now.

437
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably a good 90 yeah okay so let's let some let's feel better.

438
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.780
Yeah yeah

439
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It is the past. And you can think about it, it's not happening. Now you're with someone, it's telling you that's wrong.

440
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's wrong. And I would have

441
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotten everyone immediately to safety. Every one of those people every one of them recording. Okay, they all needed help, and rescue

442
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Me Utley

443
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so bring up that that sense of that inner, inner connection with with protection and

444
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing some wisdom, but do this scary stuff this hard stuff and pulling that imagery. If you can do it.

445
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's let's see what happens with this.

446
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and short. Let's breathe in together. Breathing into that belly.

447
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling

448
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

449
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me when you're ready, what comes up to you.

450
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.700
It just like

451
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.270
I think like

452
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.180
Nick: As I was a child like growing up.

453
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:22.200
Nick: There was like generally like chaos in one form or another happening.

454
00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.370
And I think that

455
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.140
The reason that my protective figures are like

456
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:37.530
Nick: Spirits of forest mountains is because I, being able to go outside.

457
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.310
And like

458
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:42.930
You know, I mean,

459
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:48.120
Into the woods to like play yeah like

460
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.400
Like going through like

461
00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:53.550
Like to narnia you know like

462
00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:55.920
Nick: The word job almost

463
00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, yeah.

464
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Really different than your reality. Yeah.

465
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.660
Nick: So yeah, that's really all the further I gotten

466
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we go with was that go with that. That Narnia.

467
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Access to that that portal. Okay.

468
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: With that worst image. You're doing great. Hang in there for it. Okay.

469
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold these two experiences together.

470
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice inhale into the bottom of the alarm big belly breath.

471
00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

472
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling letting it all go

473
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:48.120
It's good to think that

474
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.500
I don't know, I guess if like back then I was able to escape it then like

475
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.040
Escape is like, you know,

476
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.710
Probably possible from any challenge.

477
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

478
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Escape to safety.

479
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.880
Escape to safety escape to distraction.

480
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that connects you. I don't know. It's pretty big. But let's just go with that. Let's go. Escape to to safety and destruction are possible.

481
01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And won't be doing this one too long to kind of go short on this.

482
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope that Worst Picture.

483
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And there is escape to safety.

484
01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I bet I'm not sharing. I'm just staring at about myself. Right.

485
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Was doing the therapy here. Yeah, I'm like I was thoroughly enjoying it all about you.

486
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling me all your childhood experiences as

487
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, that's a nice looking at the time. And no, it's 10 seconds.

488
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you're looking at it and let me make it full screen.

489
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice, nice giggle.

490
01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's hard work.

491
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring that WORST piece. Hold it there be present without sense of all that quality and maybe even in that Narnia and I always have the ability to escape into distraction.

492
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All together.

493
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Share when you're ready.

494
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:36.690
You know, think of like a positive like

495
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.690
Like outlook.

496
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:55.320
Nick: Which I guess is the goal, but like I can't think of when I think of escape. I think of the fact that out of the four boys present three of us became drug addicts and one well two of us during the Navy me and AJ joined the Navy.

497
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:03.510
Nick: Myself and to have the other brothers also became drug addicts, so

498
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.110
Nick: Like I think escape like

499
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:08.640
Like

500
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a negative opinion about that word, so

501
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What I would invite is this other word which is it safe.

502
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's different. That's a different experience. So that distraction word was risky. Maybe we won't continue to do that one. Okay, well, we'll do, we'll, we'll put in the safety idea. So let's, I want to be able to see here. So let's look at each other for a second.

503
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: In that in that negative that WORST piece for you.

504
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know, in a sense, what the belief about yourself is in that, you know,

505
01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.600
Nick: I would probably say that like

506
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Being a trial. Okay, let me try to explain. I am I am

507
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.820
Part of a really shitty thing that happened to someone

508
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm shitty

509
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a part of something shitty

510
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Shitty

511
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes. Yeah, definitely. Alright, so now

512
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time on this. Okay, here we go.

513
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see this imagery on some little boy, five, six year old and you know you're, you have this sense of good, bad, right, wrong about that time you know something's off. I'm guessing.

514
01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm a part of something shitty I'm part of this.

515
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: watch very carefully what comes up.

516
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you want to believe about yourself.

517
01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the I Am. That wouldn't been ideal.

518
01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

519
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The belief about you. What would you like to have believed about yourself.

520
01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can walk me through it and I can help you if it doesn't come quickly we can kind of wander through your free association here. Yeah, I think at that point, like

521
01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.240
Like wanted to not

522
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.290
Do that and I wanted to like

523
01:05:50.670 --> 01:06:01.620
Nick: Like not be there for that. And I wanted to tell, but I was told, like, Oh, we can't tell you know you can't like, Tell. And so I probably wanted to be honest.

524
01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I am honest. Yeah.

525
01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you would like to have been thinking, Yeah, okay. Okay, so we're gonna we're gonna work that one. Okay, so hold down one up. We're listening to snap this negative network you have visited in a while. Okay, so I am honest.

526
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And that worst image.

527
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold it in there. We won't go along, if this is last if they last too long. I can shorten them. Are they lasting too long for you.

528
01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I stopped sharing a better not.

529
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.290
Do that to you again.

530
01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm honest.

531
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the valley.

532
01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:35.790
And

533
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it go

534
01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.210
Nick: Surrounding that event.

535
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:14.880
Nick: I was like a child like a like a six, seven year old kid and so

536
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.730
Nick: I probably say that like I was kind of innocent.

537
01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you were

538
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I am innocent. We're going to go with that.

539
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:33.150
Well,

540
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I am innocent.

541
01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale, I had to mute myself. I've got a trombone player in my house.

542
01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.320
Nick: Saturdays, probably not used to

543
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being able to do on Saturdays.

544
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Practicing I think it's great.

545
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like therapeutic. Yeah.

546
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:16.050
Nick: Like a scale or something to

547
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.080
Me like reframe some things like

548
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.710
Yeah, so

549
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:42.270
Nick: I think that, as a result of that experience like

550
01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:55.050
Nick: Like I like I never did that to anyone. Again, like it. It brought like some weird shit up like that it like that like that that taught me to have weird

551
01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:00.150
Nick: Things that I did like later on as a kid, but I guess like that so

552
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.010
Doesn't quite matter as much right now but

553
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.880
Nick: The idea is that

554
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.050
Nick: It's like a child like I don't know anything.

555
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a child I was

556
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I was innocent, and even like

557
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.630
Like potentially

558
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.010
Nick: There's probably like a lot of guilt carried

559
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.000
From that kind of thing.

560
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:36.660
So,

561
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But guilt speaks to that somehow you had freedom to to take some sort of action as a as a

562
01:11:49.920 --> 01:12:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Little guy. You don't. You didn't have it when someone says, Don't Tell, and they're bigger and stronger and you don't have a safe environment of trust in your mother in a stepfather in a stepmother. You had no refuge. You had no wonder trust came up. There was no one to trust.

563
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no one to tell you would have if you knew you could go be an honest.

564
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Honest boy to him at least said out loud, whatever this confusing thing you just saw, to have an adult decide right from wrong but you to vote least uttered it

565
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And then an adult would manage what to do six year old six year olds and supposed to know what to do what kids are supposed to do, is we just we say whatever is on our mind our adults filter it through the belief system of the home and whatever culture dominates we shape.

566
01:12:51.060 --> 01:13:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, what, what to do and here's how we would do it. And we model what to do and we relieve you of any burden of having to wonder, and we keep you safe you had

567
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No choice.

568
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.310
You

569
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.190
did not feel guilty.

570
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There was nothing you could do.

571
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You had no one you could tell

572
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You had, I think, over time, I'll probably hear more and more about how this system could have created people that would even in their wildest imaginations would would want to hurt one another. This way, you know,

573
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a system that's not that one brothers bad either. It's a that's a system. There's something yeah really bad going on.

574
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said, like in like in different ways. Yeah. Yeah. So, and then that goes backward and then his family and his family and the key is, we have choice now.

575
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking at something very difficult now and you were able to bring up words like I'm I'm innocent. Right. And I know you're you're you're you're using this word guilt. But guilt sort of says that you failed to do something, but there was nothing you could do.

576
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Understand, yeah.

577
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:31.860
Nick: Yeah yeah I think like in life. I've carried a lot of it, like, like I guess like that's more like what I'm getting at is, like, I think that Gil has been carried

578
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: As a result, yeah. Whether or not it's true. And, you know, perhaps, that has shaped like certain things later on. And it sounds like you're alluding to some other things that you want to take a peek got

579
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just in terms of like reason that I have a negative self image potentially

580
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah well connected

581
01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's see what charges left. How much charges left in the body right now. See if you can scan scan those those very informing parts of you often that that gut and just see what's going on in there.

582
01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:17.310
It's pretty

583
01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.770
dumb down

584
01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And what negative opinion assessment judgment emotion. What is still left let's let's label that what's still floating around.

585
01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:56.160
Visited guilt.

586
01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then revisit it. So I mean it's guilt. No, I don't. I don't. I don't think I

587
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:12.420
Don't think currently there any like things that are proud of any kind of negative emotions or anything.

588
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there were negative emotions discuss today. They weren't so what I'm asking is that that's okay would be normal. But let's let's let's be gentle and respectful of them.

589
01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If they don't just wander freely. Let's put them in in the box or let's do some distancing from them, which would be better, putting it in the metal barrel with the band around it and we open it up together.

590
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Very carefully and deliberately

591
01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you want to send it down. The tram. My only concern with tram and it always has.

592
01:16:52.650 --> 01:17:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it stops at the bottom. And I always wonder if it just stops there if it stays in body. I always wondered that metaphor, something about it always struck me difficult because

593
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It stays at the base, you know, and I listened to how you talk about how how this energy moves from the chest and then it just stays in the bottom of this gut. So for me, I guess something comes up around wanting something where it really does just drift away so far that you

594
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you can't see it. Yeah, definitely. Like you're insane maybe right

595
01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do, let's do river and whatever maybe it doesn't have a name. Maybe you can picture. It's a blob, or it's something okay whatever the is left whatever the charge whatever the energy

596
01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That it is not your responsibility alone to have to work through this that you and I are doing this together. Okay, you had to go through this by yourself.

597
01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't have to this time. Okay. And whatever it is that you learn in here with me.

598
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Becomes yours. I don't promote enabling so that you're left with no new skills, everything we do in here. You're going to own and you're going to have your own write your own therapist inside. Okay, so I'm not going to create dependency, but for now.

599
01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, kind of nice to have somebody who who's here for you.

600
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's let's do it together. So I'm picturing it myself. For me it was this really black Targhee blob.

601
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's on a log for me when you do your own imagery

602
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And have it pass down a river moving further and further away.

603
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would invite you, as I'm I'm inviting myself.

604
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To be surrounded and embodied

605
01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: With the wisdom of what I know to do to protect myself and keep myself safe and I invite you to do the same with nature and its innocence and purity.

606
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no mixed message in nature. It's not no confusion here.

607
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It is wise and simple, direct and honest.

608
01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.080
Nurturing protective

609
01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are there with it on the riverbank

610
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to witness distance with this imagery of this thing floating further and further away so that you can barely see it.

611
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe not see it at all.

612
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you remain

613
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: With the qualities

614
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Of safety gross and wisdom.

615
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Our sort of closing experience and

616
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You doing okay right now.

617
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, excellent. If something comes up if dreams get get funky because you haven't visited this in a while. I've highly recommend keep a little pad of paper next door if it decides to intrude in your dreams that would be normal.

618
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, if other big emotions come up. Don't judge yourself on it be a witness to it.

619
01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me you can journal it, you can always put it in the container can send it down the river and just say, Hi, this is meaningful something important is happening. I'll bring this to the therapeutic environment, and we'll talk about it.

620
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to if you need a quick outlet. You can certainly text it to me. Also, if you want immediate access to connection.

621
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I have aware of your not too distant experience with

622
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The suicidal ideation. So it's those come up with those creep in. I want to know. Okay.

623
01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And have they been

624
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:42.660
They haven't been

625
01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and really the goal here, right, is to maybe be unearthing some of these unconscious things that might have contributed to

626
01:21:56.610 --> 01:22:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That being a solution and maybe they won't be a solution anymore. You know, once there's no rejected part of the self. There's nothing. There's no longer anything to be afraid of. And then there might be more. I will tell you.

627
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hold space for what you shared today and a lot more. So I'm I'm perfectly capable of hearing more and containing more just want you to know that.

628
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, for sure. Okay, so let's schedule another session, thinking about your schedule and not wanting to your finances to get too out of control here for you. What would you like to

629
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Have something pencil, then

630
01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:45.030
See

631
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.570
What

632
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Done Wednesday or Thursday. Yeah, I haven't penciled in for 8am. On February 20

633
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.150
This Thursday, right,

634
01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This week is going to be when you see, take your time right now. I happen to have Tuesday, also at eight o'clock don't know how long that'll last Oh actually, there's a lot of a lot of idioms open for some reason.

635
01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday has an 8am Tuesday and then Thursday we we mentioned

636
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:31.500
Yeah, let's do you see

637
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:36.240
Nick: I probably I think like

638
01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:49.050
Nick: Maybe Tuesday. Like for me, like obviously like this did bring like weird things up and I don't believe I'll react poorly to it, but maybe sooner would be like

639
01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: A better like make sure like this again.

640
01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:54.600
Nick: Just in case like some weird shit.

641
01:23:55.170 --> 01:24:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And don't be shy about reaching out with even a little text. Okay. Doesn't have to be long winded. You can send me a little emoji if you want

642
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I'm going to erase February 20 I'm writing and next appointment is February 18 at 8am. This was lovely. Being able to meet in here. It doesn't mean we have to do, em, Dr. Maybe we'll, we'll do some different work together.

643
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Depends on kind of what comes up for you. Okay. But I loved it because I love the fact that you know you weren't struggling with the connection.

644
01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And the quality of the video and the sound on my end it anyway was was great. Um, if it turns out you want to play with carving out time really early. If people aren't in the office really early.

645
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:46.320
Nick: Like 7am

646
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.010
Because

647
01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: No one should be here between seven and eight. Yeah. And then in subsequent weeks if you tell me. Yeah, we want to do that, what I

648
01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I have people that typically I could do the following February 27 minutes seven is at this point, I've got sevens booked up next week, believe it or not, it seems crazy but if people do it before work, you know, yeah, totally. Yeah.

649
01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.050
Nick: Yeah, I think, yeah, I would probably even just scheduled at 27th at seven as well.

650
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and we've got lots of time to change it if it just all of a sudden the context of your work and personal life just shifts, we can change it. Okay, it's plenty of time.

651
01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: At least I'm protecting this spot for you.

652
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

653
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You did some really hard work. I hope you're proud of yourself.

654
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for going over time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm honored and I look forward to seeing you again. Okay, reach out if you need to. Please, please, please don't be shy about it. Thank you get to you. Have a good week YouTube
