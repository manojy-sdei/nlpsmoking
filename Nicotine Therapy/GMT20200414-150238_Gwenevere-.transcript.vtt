Shaun W.: You never texted me Glenn without lady called me I'd never got know Texas from he asked you to balls coming

5
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sunday, what that means.

6
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.280
Shaun W.: You never texted me the lady said you were trying to text me yesterday he was coming to the meeting, but I never got none of your Texas.

7
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but which meeting, we're talking about

8
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.760
Shaun W.: This meeting.

9
00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's figure out what's up with that number one, that's my choice. I do it to be helpful. That's a hope I can get it together. The night before, but you confirmed in group so you

10
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.150
Shaun W.: Had already confirmed. Oh they yeah they called me this morning said that you were calling them seeing that I didn't confirm group they were

11
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't control what people say to you.

12
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.480
Shaun W.: I'm just telling you, I'm just telling you what people said to me.

13
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.930
Shaun W.: That's what I'm telling you what people said to me, said that you called them and said that I didn't you text me and I didn't

14
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.760
Shaun W.: See that always come to the group. So I'm telling you what he told me that I was at seven o'clock this morning. I said, Yeah, I'm going. She never texted me. I never got a text from

15
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's fine and but just know I can't control, even though I may say something I can't do. So let's just take the parts of parts that I can control. So this is what I sent

16
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Last night.

17
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.750
Shaun W.: Are you sure you got to make

18
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

19
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your connections breaking up a little bit. Um, so it was sent looks like my time it's

20
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Your time it would be 333 35 is a

21
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.940
Shaun W.: Short initials received because I don't have none of those. I'll show you all don't have none of those on my Texas. That's what will trickle.

22
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Down time we got a slow time down little

23
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Too slow time down

24
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a nice breath.

25
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice how important just someone's wrong someone's right this is about really technology doesn't always work. I've learned that when something's green. Sometimes it doesn't go through. Sometimes it's green, and it goes through. See, here's other stuff. See how it's green.

26
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So yours are like always, green and some of

27
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.380
Shaun W.: Those are old.

28
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Just listen.

29
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Green.

30
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes still means they went through. So I have no clear way of knowing whether someone got a message or not. Do you see that for some people, they'll say to me, I'm trying to learn myself.

31
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, if they're blue then for sure they went through and I'm like, oh, okay. Is that true for everyone. And then I look at yours is a lot like other people's and they're green and sometimes they go through. Sometimes they don't. There's no way for me to know

32
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

33
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell whether a text message went through.

34
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you know a trick.

35
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.330
Shaun W.: Or they switch over.

36
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.330
Shaun W.: I don't, I didn't get texts from you. That's all I got a text from yesterday. See what happened to group.

37
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.250
Shaun W.: You don't have an agreed yesterday. The sound was cutting out. So I put the video like you showed me take the video off. And that's what I did is breaking here because everything was messy. Have you guys kept freezing up

38
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.270
Shaun W.: So I took the video off to see if you'll just play thing. And then I had to call back and say, back in

39
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you sign back in

40
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.940
Shaun W.: Yeah, he let me back in

41
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

42
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's something else. So here's what happened.

43
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard your, your piece of it. Then there's also me as a facilitator, trying to get statements from everyone on the record of kind of what their thoughts content was and I did not know could not see you there. So I thought you were gone.

44
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.280
Shaun W.: There. Oh, I thought you guys

45
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.860
Shaun W.: Yeah, I thought you guys at the very end. I thought you guys told us to leave. That's what I left my guys. I thought you guys told me

46
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.990
Shaun W.: I think I said it was done.

47
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, at the end, it was done.

48
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.640
Shaun W.: Okay, yeah.

49
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

50
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I always want to hear from everyone at the end. It's very rare that I won't have some little statement about a group topic I'll probably want to hear a little something.

51
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.720
Okay.

52
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just we're doing very much logistics of texting very much logistics of group when when I wrote to you what happened.

53
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I probably should have skipped that and just waited to talk to you. And here, but that's what I meant. Meaning, I couldn't. I thought you were gone, and I couldn't get a comment from you about the group topic.

54
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what that was probably should just stick with this is scheduling. Sometimes I deviate from it and I pay the price.

55
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can't go on and on about it because look how complicated is it takes really slowing down and taking each little piece. I'm not going to go in about some green text and blue text. I'm not going to go on into that in itself.

56
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So it does take time.

57
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So there we go.

58
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what was your comment for group was the comment that I can maybe put in that note that didn't get said

59
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.500
Shaun W.: Though I think we were doing was saying, well, we're our addiction was and all that. That's all we're doing.

60
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.790
Shaun W.: All we were doing was saying what we're drug of choice was what

61
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not a nice Frank or that that is definitely not all we were doing.

62
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.210
Shaun W.: That, that's all I think I heard

63
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

64
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.570
Shaun W.: Remember I didn't sign on for

65
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:26.040
Shaun W.: Hours ON THAT THE OFFICE THING from HTTP to in the way in two minutes from the, what you call it when you call in to get the number me 30 minutes to get into your

66
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection in here is not great. Some of what you say broke up. I think he said you took 32 minutes to get into the group.

67
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:44.250
Shaun W.: Or like 30 minutes. Yeah. It took me that long waiting for them to give me the number to get into the group I signed on it.

68
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I would encourage if you notice at the end of a group and you haven't said your thought about the group topic because it's pretty rare that I don't say, hey, I want to hear from everyone kind of want to hear from everyone.

69
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, they want to speak up and say, hey, I haven't shared especially

70
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.160
Shaun W.: What was the topic.

71
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna open up a note. Hold on just a minute.

72
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You tend to make a big fuss about that.

73
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it like we don't celebrate much for birthday.

74
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.070
Not really.

75
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

76
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We are

77
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Reviewing goals.

78
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To prevent

79
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do

80
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to what we do last time we did

81
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

82
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: She who

83
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You are sharing

84
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A significant event that happened when you were 24

85
00:10:51.060 --> 00:11:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I was in a still trying to identify a target to address through em Dr trying to find a really core

86
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of memory around the PTSD symptoms. Something you brought up that happened when you were 24

87
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You put it a distress level of

88
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm guessing that 50 is how you feel about the memory now not how you felt back then I could be wrong.

89
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not. Maybe really as a 50 your worst one the most distressing thing for you out of hundred was the accusation and the incarceration for those four years, the guards beating you up in that false accusation.

90
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it surprises me that your dad did things like my dad chopped me up with a ninja sword.

91
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: He caught my ear, try to cut my finger step my shoulder split my skull. Right. It surprises me that that would be a distress of 50 that it wouldn't reach something higher I'm wonder about that. Does it surprise you. Or when you compare yourself to other people's stories.

92
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.600
Someone else told that story.

93
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.730
Shaun W.: Well, there's a

94
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.370
Shaun W.: Deep other people that are worse.

95
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you think other people have had it worse.

96
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

97
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you tell this story. Often this one with what your dad did you know know

98
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The people that tell you that they've had worse things happen to you or those people in prison or your buddies that have had it worse.

99
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:57.600
Shaun W.: Those people I had seen on TV or do they just know there's people out there. It's got to be worse than what are your brand.

100
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: In your mind, do you believe that because people their body may have suffered more harm or emotionally may have suffered more harm that somehow you don't deserve.

101
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To be really angry really upset that you somehow don't have a right to that response.

102
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.630
Shaun W.: Come on it.

103
00:13:51.060 --> 00:14:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let me check in. We kind of touched on a little bit. I want to pull away from that a little bit. We may come back to the some of that a little later, but first I want to pull back a little, just to sort of start with

104
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that are going on, sort of in your current life kind of pull back a little.

105
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to check on how

106
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How your sleep has been

107
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.020
Shaun W.: I don't know, never released the good work.

108
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.980
Shaun W.: I've been waking up my kidneys hurting real bad.

109
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like kidney. How do you know it's your kidney. Tell me about that.

110
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.090
Shaun W.: My

111
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.460
Shaun W.: Kidneys are

112
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It was

113
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: In slow motion.

114
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It was in slow motion, but I think I heard you say it's in my lower back where my where my kidneys are

115
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.740
Shaun W.: All right, here we go.

116
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.210
Shaun W.: I can hear me know

117
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.840
Shaun W.: When someone calls in it cuts my headphones. Oh.

118
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's what everyone it messes with stuff. Um, I try and say, hey, try and put them on. Do Not Disturb mode on the phone, but sometimes that doesn't seem to even help. I don't know what the answer, wish I knew.

119
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've got some kidney pain. How many days is that's going on.

120
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:31.620
Shaun W.: Well,

121
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.370
Shaun W.: I'll start up yesterday I kept I kept throwing up all the yesterday. I don't know why, but after our Dropbox, you'll find

122
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:51.990
Shaun W.: And I found out to people at my work had a coronal virus and they they took two of our bosses and made them go home for a week or so because they had contact with that person. But they didn't tell none of us at work.

123
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.400
Shaun W.: So everybody found out

124
00:15:53.970 --> 00:16:00.870
Shaun W.: I found out yesterday was like, what, so they leave these two off to go home, but didn't tell none of us if we're the ones working with the person that people

125
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I would feel so past

126
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.160
Shaun W.: Yeah. Should piss me off.

127
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:13.290
Shaun W.: They didn't turn away. Nothing yesterday. He was like the boss was telling me like keep growing like there's two people got coronavirus here like what

128
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels disrespectful, doesn't it.

129
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.360
Shaun W.: Yeah.

130
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what do you do with that. Does that mean you you talk to someone, or you wear a mask. When are you going to do to to address the issue, personally.

131
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.020
Shaun W.: Go to work. I don't wear a mask and go to work and work.

132
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.360
Shaun W.: I figured if I die from it. Then we'll

133
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Connections.

134
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:50.880
Shaun W.: Okay, hear me. Hello.

135
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how you just sound it

136
00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.850
Shaun W.: Watch. Hold on, I'm gonna put in these other headphones with. That's what I used to have to use with you guys this zoom program much

137
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.770
Shaun W.: Better

138
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: also put a note, I just remember you said in in group that you had gotten a car.

139
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That was one of your goals was I'm getting a car. I'll say 20 $500 by May. So you already got a car and

140
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: There was some it broke down a little bit. Do you feel like it's running solid now.

141
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, shoot. Dude, I can't hear you at all. We gotta keep playing with the sound a little bit. Check the little button on your. I don't know if there's a little mute or something on that.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a button.

143
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.740

145
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That you achieve this goal.

146
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: On a car.

147
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting for waiting to hear you can't quite hear you, yet we're waiting for it.

148
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, try it now you've got a good video right this second can hear you yet. Not yet.

150
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want, you could log back out. If you want to do the whole old school thing where we just log back out and come back in and might work. Sometimes that works for people. I'll stay here.

151
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let you back in

152
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I can't hear you.

153
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha, gotcha.

154
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.560
Shaun W.: You're wondering should I try to throw my friend.

155
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.790
Shaun W.: Hey, can you hear me now.

156
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:25.980
Shaun W.: Okay.

157
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure it out. Yeah, it's, we're not sometimes just want to back out can wake everything up. I don't get it. But

158
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:38.100
Shaun W.: Yeah, I turned around. I bought this car and I don't know much about it. So I pulled out the oil stick and I thought it said minimum. So I over filled with oil.

159
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:51.180
Shaun W.: And I'm driving on the street, big or small starts blowing out the back and I was all what the folks I pull over right away my nephew pulls me home. And then that Monday the these Mexican dudes came over to check the car. And then they said, Hey, who put oil in it. And also, I didn't

160
00:20:52.860 --> 00:21:02.670
Shaun W.: Like look its way over filled with oil and so the dream and they say, you look, you didn't blow out your ring. So they said just drive it burn the oil off for a couple days and I did, how it runs great like

161
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.160
Shaun W.: Like a champ. So nice car.

162
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So now, is this a sign that you need sunglasses.

163
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.650
Shaun W.: Yeah, I do wear glasses, but i don't i don't have them.

164
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

165
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I bet that that writing was really small on that stick right

166
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.270
Yeah.

167
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.850
Shaun W.: Oh, I can't believe I did that, man. Almost, almost ruined that car.

168
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.340
Shaun W.: It was on my third day, having it.

169
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what's up, is it just you know making time for yourself to get those bosses, or what's the deal.

170
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:46.950
Shaun W.: It costs money. I just got to save money because I bought this car I save money to buy this car. Now I don't have no money. So I gotta save money again to go get an apartment now.

171
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.500
Shaun W.: Okay, let's start looking for an apartment.

172
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got this one for achieved.

173
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's go to

174
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Save for an apartment. I think I've got find find a place to live. I've already got that as a goal.

175
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.270
Shaun W.: Yeah, that's the next. That's the next one I'm working on.

176
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were starting with zero and savings. Is that right, because he's bought the car.

177
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.510
Shaun W.: Yeah, started with zero

178
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.800
Shaun W.: It took me a while just to save 1500

179
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you realize how quickly you put that together and you say, it took you a while.

180
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm

181
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEIR MONEY IS GETTING DIVERTED all kinds of directions is taking longer. You need to give yourself credit for how quickly put that together. I don't think you give yourself nearly enough credit

182
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.220
Shaun W.: To get it done.

183
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You are and you are getting it done, but you're minimizing that's that's the thing for you not seeing your goal. Y'all know listen

184
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.040
Shaun W.: He's made a wise in his involvement.

185
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

186
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No, this is tangible you set a goal for may

187
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I may 20 or something and you got the car.

188
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Before that, I mean, this is your real I'm making it up, got it done before. Even the deadline.

189
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Most people what ends up happening is they are gambling in a way. Oh, I'm smoking it away, they're putting their is diverting

190
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're not getting it done, you need to take pride in what you did, you're handling it. Okay, you have a lot of reason to get yourself distracted and you're not. You're staying focused

191
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

192
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think. Now this I, I'm going to go get a you said find a place to live.

193
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You originally it was spend less money on beeping. That was one it was going over there. Now we got on 331 told me that we would help me. Okay, so is there money. Are you still a thing. Or if you let that go, says, oh,

194
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.450
Shaun W.: I gotta let it go to save money.

195
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, still wanting to to

196
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:12.690
Shaun W.: Will they gave me a marijuana card but i'm gonna i'm not gonna do it because it costs too much money. So I'm not even gonna smoke and stuff. And it made me feel better. Nothing but I'm not going to smoke it because it just costs too much money.

197
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.430
Shaun W.: So I'm not, I don't even. I don't think I need it. It makes me lazy.

198
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.060
Shaun W.: Okay, so I don't think I'm gonna do that. No more.

199
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.920
Shaun W.: Boxes good enough.

200
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:36.810
Shaun W.: I just, I really want to up my soapbox and to be honest with you, I just don't know why you guys won't do that one strip at ease. Nothing. I need to strip in the morning in the strip at night.

201
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.810
Shaun W.: Once drips really nothing

202
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: One step is nothing, I want to strip in the morning and in the evening. That's what

203
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.520
Shaun W.: That's it. Just one in the morning, one at night. That's it.

204
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

205
00:24:54.630 --> 00:25:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so on March 31 you said a doctor told me that we would help with my post traumatic stress disorder PTSD symptoms. These aren't quotes

206
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You this one was what you said.

207
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Was checking on your own level.

208
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe some contradiction, just check. Hold on. Ready.

209
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, back then, you said, I don't care for it.

210
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: NOTICE HOW THEY SAY IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. So what's going on between I don't care for it. What's

211
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.690
Shaun W.: What are you doing, what we'd

212
00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

213
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.880
Shaun W.: I don't know, I just, it just making me feel like lazy and and

214
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:46.680
Shaun W.: I don't know, I just, I'm not liking it. And so I'm just, I don't know, I like it makes me feel better, but it makes me feel lazy and I gotta go to work and stuff like that. I just, I'm not

215
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.800
Shaun W.: I don't know, I just think it costs too much money.

216
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:57.180
Shaun W.: It costs a lot of money. So I need to get an apartment. I can't afford it. I can barely I'm not stop smoking too because I can't afford smoking here.

217
00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have a goal. Thank you for clarifying that. Um, so I have a goal that you've set and I put it way out into December. Tell me if this feels feels feels like a good date I have December.

218
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Find a good place to live.

219
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And

220
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How much are you thinking for first last kind of thing or

221
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How much do you think in a trying to say for a good place.

222
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.690
Shaun W.: Like 1200

223
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That would cover first and last

224
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:44.790
Shaun W.: Yeah, but it's not. I'm gonna have to live in a war zone because I'm a felon so they don't do first. And lastly, they just deposited in the, the, I can already get apartment right now a two bedroom, but we don't want it.

225
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.400
Shaun W.: You want to escape.

226
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to get a better place.

227
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.050
Shaun W.: Yeah, I just don't want to live in the war zone. That's where I

228
00:26:52.650 --> 00:27:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Live. Oh, but I know we've talked about this and you're so sure that you're you that you couldn't get in in an area where you wouldn't be exposed to that life. You're so sure because you've checked it out or is it just your

229
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Assumption your social

230
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.800
Shaun W.: Just my assumption.

231
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what if there's a place I mean look at what's going on right now. What if exceptions are being made, maybe they're not going to do the same background check, or whatever, whatever. Maybe they'll do a short term lease to get

232
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: A warm body in covering these requirements, because people are writing for all crashing and burning here.

233
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe this is good timing to say, hey, listen, give me. Okay. Okay. Every time you know two days before the first of the month, you know, maybe you can play a little bit with

234
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This you know kind of changing your credit history a little bit saying, Hey, give me a shot. We'll do it. What about three months least you guys probably needed I need it.

235
00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good for it and maybe even being able to have more saved to get ahead and say, let me give you first and last because I mean I want, I don't want you to be in the war zone, either. I don't want to expose that negative stuff you've had that for a long time.

236
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.160
Shaun W.: I grew up there. That's where I grew up. I grew up right there.

237
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So you acknowledge that it may be assumption. Have you been checking out maybe a place that you would like to live, maybe call

238
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:29.400
Shaun W.: Yeah, I have. And once I tell him felon, it shuts down right away. He said, I didn't this lady to give me a list of felony friendly apartments. They're all over the world. I was like, wow.

239
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.970
Shaun W.: I guess I gotta find like a private owners on maybe in a different area.

240
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

241
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So who do you know, or maybe you have one in. I'm just brainstorming. This will get your brain going in, like Facebook marketplace, they have, they do private owner rentals, things like that where you could maybe be in a fancy Fishman say mouse and you can maybe run out of space or share

242
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I told you just brainstorm.

243
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you say I could maybe

244
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at private. What were you thinking

245
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.990
Shaun W.: I'll just find someone that owns an apartment little apartment complex and see it's a rent to me.

246
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.950
Okay, here we go.

247
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know I have a car and you can even go by and say hey,

248
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.330
Shaun W.: Yeah, like to drive around

249
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.720
Shaun W.: You know what I know is I got a car and I don't really go anywhere.

250
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:39.360
Shaun W.: It's cool. The store bag worth, that's it. I hope I don't get this growing awareness is I can't believe that they didn't tell nobody at work.

251
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.200
Shaun W.: Well, I think if they didn't want to cause a panic.

252
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.590
Shaun W.: Because then everybody would have laughed at me like, man, because everybody told her about yesterday with the last one megabyte started trip and all that one.

253
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:58.350
Shaun W.: Well, yeah, to people got Chrome errors in here. These they sent them home but not us, because we need to do the work there. They just stand there and watch us work.

254
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And your belief is if it's my time to go, it's my time to go.

255
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.110
Shaun W.: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

256
00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there, is there more to it than that.

257
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.860
Shaun W.: No there's not. What is your time, it's your time, you know, keeping it

258
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, I'm not going to get into that with you.

259
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.290
Shaun W.: Oh yeah, please don't

260
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like cheese.

261
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.620
Oh,

262
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

263
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so he touched on a little bit of my sleep's messed up noticing this observation of kidney. Have you ever had a kidney.

264
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Injury and

265
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.050
Shaun W.: Ego.

266
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:50.430
Shaun W.: I know your kidneys out they teach you in boxing. So these your kidneys are right here guarded the right here under your ribcage in your back.

267
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know,

268
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.580
Shaun W.: So I know that's where it's

269
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:55.980
Shaun W.: It's right there.

270
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.200

272
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.950
Shaun W.: Last month, a couple of about three weeks.

273
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anything changed. Besides, like anything you're eating, drinking, anything else changed.

274
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.230
Shaun W.: I'm not, I don't really have much of an appetite for

275
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Any weight loss.

276
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:21.870
Shaun W.: No.

277
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.140
Shaun W.: I don't know, I weighed myself.

278
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder, well, you might notice in in your clothes being looser

279
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.280
Shaun W.: I noticed as I

280
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:40.620
Shaun W.: Did I used to eat, and now it's like I don't have an appetite. Okay, nothing like I won't eat nothing. I'll be like one little thing or be. That's it.

281
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:48.270
Shaun W.: And it's usually something not good like sweets don't either. So it's not using on the food. Yeah.

282
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Any nightmares waking up.

283

Shaun W.: Last week,

287
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We got a little bit of time today.

288
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I would like to spend some time doing the wording of it sounds a little weird but it's called installing sounds robotic but it's really

289
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Weaving in some positive imagery are using the the end or

290
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have the two soda cans with the two

291
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.980
Shaun W.: Other right there. I'm just gonna grab them.

292
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

293
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your eyes.

294
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're looking at those objects.

295
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to see your eyes moving left and right.

296
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.410
Shaun W.: With

297
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: how close they are

298
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.980
Shaun W.: Closer.

299
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think so. I think if you get closer. It's going to strain your eyes, and I know

300
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: People are about from their wrist to their shoulder and distance from the object that tends to not pull on the muscles too hard. Does it feel like that's about the distance

301
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.650
Shaun W.: You want to do this. Yeah.

302
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that hurt.

303
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. All right, good.

304
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

305
00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.040

Gwenevere Abriel: Go to

307
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a really specific protective figure nurturing figure and wise figures sort of all in one.

308
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this

309
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure of your grandma, you have a real person that made you feel safe. She took care of you.

310
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: She would talk to you about things all the time she she's deceased now. But when you think about her.

311
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

312
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what I'd like to do today is I'd like you to just for a moment and I can close them with you if you like. So you don't feel like you're being stared at. But I want you to close your eyes and really get

313
00:34:49.590 --> 00:35:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into the imagery of her and having her interacting with you in current day just just see what comes up out of the imagination as far as just being present with

314
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the types of things.

315
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And have your grandma.

316
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Interacting with you.

317
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just bringing it into that workspace in your mind where you're very focused narrowly

318
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just on the imagery, you

319
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of safety.

320
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Essential sense of nurturing meaning her wanting for you, your growth for you to reach your potential

321
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.360

Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of be with that.

323
00:35:52.770 --> 00:36:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And pay attention to where you are with her. Are you sitting, standing eating together you walking just pay attention to what comes up.

324
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to even tell me this is just sort of your private imagery, it's up to you to bring it into awareness.

325
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's deeply personal

326
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's your space you're

327
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: picturing grandma and you

328
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you have that imagery, very solidified

329
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to do an iteration with your eyes open and I'll be doing it quite slowly. So hold that in your mind that imagery. Okay. You can be looking at the tops of those containers pretty slowly.

330
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just catching the pace. Out of the corner of your eye with my fingers.

356
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune into both body and mind and yes it does take concentration

357
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.170

420
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like whether it's cut the rope on it. It's not giving Sean a hard time for smoking. It's well do we need to brainstorm distraction techniques. Do we need gummed we need to patch as you want to try what the trend. It isn't me giving you a hard time. Do you know that

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.950
Shaun W.: Yeah.

422
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.130
Shaun W.: You're just trying to say you set a goal. So

423
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.020
Shaun W.: Okay.

424
00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also are very committed once you say you're going to do something, you kind of do it. So I'm wondering if we write it down by then then Sean's really going to do it.

425
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe he's not

426
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To it yet.

427
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.420
Shaun W.: Yeah, I'm quitting quitting smoking weed though today.

428
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:41.340
Shaun W.: First day

429
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, maybe we'll see. Maybe. Or maybe he would maybe get rid of it. I don't know what kind of commitment would look like would you give it to someone else.

430
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:54.450
Shaun W.: Do it.

431
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's set up an appointment. Two weeks from now make sure that that we're agile.

432
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Changes with your work, let me know.

433
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Further, I know in advance easier it is for me to to move things around. But right now.

437
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't make sure it goes through. I don't, I'm not God, I'm so sorry. I wish I knew I would totally text him first.

438
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:29.640

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:42.990
Shaun W.: Me, I didn't get none of them. I swear that none of those no show you if you want. I'll screenshot my phone and show you

442
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, notice how you said I need to make sure you're more than welcome to confirm an appointment, if you want to call me again.
