Jo Delgadillo: So now that I'm older. And I keep it short. Yeah.

12
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.930
Jo Delgadillo: I put myself on a guilt trip but I'm trying to get past that.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're on a guilt trip.

15
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.130
Jo Delgadillo: Just because we still live in this property trailer like now that we have money saved. We can't find something decent to move into but it's it's nice to be able to be picking you know

16
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.030
Jo Delgadillo: Settle with something just because we needed it so bad.

17
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.470
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so we're trying not to. Even though living in this trailer

18
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.540
Jo Delgadillo: Or next to move. I don't. I want for the kids. If I wanted to be a little bit more permanent

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
Jo Delgadillo: To where they have like their own space, especially Aiden. He's a teenager and

20
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.040
Jo Delgadillo: He's starting to be weird and moody and

21
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.840
Jo Delgadillo: He has attitude. He's like, and he don't even know it just like

22
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.130
Jo Delgadillo: Let it go, because he doesn't realize is doing it. Yeah.

23
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How does Adrian

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.070
Jo Delgadillo: Voice his voice is all squeaky and he's starting to get pimples and yeah

26
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.070
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, the attitude and I don't even know what face.

27
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:55.200
Jo Delgadillo: And everything is just so personal. Like everything but he's, he's a good kid. He talks to me still. So I'm thankful for that. Yeah.

28
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Communication is always being

29
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.200
Yeah.

30
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is important to discuss to me.

31
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.270
Jo Delgadillo: Oh baby showers. This Sunday.

32
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:20.010
Jo Delgadillo: And I got stopped paying for most of it. I was supposed to have help from the step mom and all of a sudden she's not going to go over nothing anymore.

33
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.500
Jo Delgadillo: And the reason we started to plan it is because I was gonna have help you know it's all on me when I called my son yesterday and I was like, what are you gonna do about this and that. And he's. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.710
Jo Delgadillo: He's like we thought you were gonna handle it.

35
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.220
Jo Delgadillo: That's why I needed help doing this because I know you guys are going through it all, throw it all on me and I thought maybe

36
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.810
Jo Delgadillo: It would help. And she somehow out of it. Yeah. Every time I ask, why is she coming knowing gives me an answer and then my son was like, Well, it's because you didn't tell her I'm like

37
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.350
Jo Delgadillo: That's Mercedes talks to her every day.

38
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.320
Jo Delgadillo: I just

39
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.430
Jo Delgadillo: Didn't want to pay for it.

40
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I see that is cycle continues. Where

41
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You, you would

42
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Participate in something or you assist with something and then it ends up being solely your responsibility.

43
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.500
Jo Delgadillo: And then on the bad guy, if I say something. Yeah.

44
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.370
Jo Delgadillo: It's like, Fine, then don't do it like and then he's like,

45
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:38.670
Jo Delgadillo: Well, you are telling me anything about it. So I didn't know what I was supposed to do. And I was like, what, it's your baby shower. You're the one that you guys are the ones who started saying that you wanted to have it this month.

46
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.090
Jo Delgadillo: I just helped you figure out a date, it would work on a Sunday. Most people don't work on Sunday.

47
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.820
Jo Delgadillo: That's the whole reason we did it on Sunday. So it worked for Katie and now all of a sudden

48
00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.800
Jo Delgadillo: My son, he's I don't. He says he loves her. And then last week, he was calling me while he was at work and she was at school, telling me that

49
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:12.630
Jo Delgadillo: He thinks she's, she's with him for money now because he got he gets pretty big checks as it gets paid really good and all of his money's gone and within days.

50
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.680
Jo Delgadillo: He says that she will keep asking for this for that for this and then he'll tell her. No, and she'll get mad.

51
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:30.660
Jo Delgadillo: She, she's 17 she's still a child, but she knows, you know, in his head. He's like, well, she's kind of grow up and I'm like, I get that. But you still have to think about it. She's 17

52
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:45.030
Jo Delgadillo: Was just 16 like she's a child still but he's just like, I just need her to know and we're preparing for a baby, but he doesn't think here. It's not hadn't even hit him yet.

53
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I wonder how plans would have been if you weren't involved.

54
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.720
Jo Delgadillo: There would never happen.

55
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.890
Jo Delgadillo: There was a little

56
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.900
Bit you tell yourself.

57
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:10.290
Jo Delgadillo: I don't think it was because I don't my notifications for my text messages, don't go off and I've tried to fix it. I think I just need a new phone.

58
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:20.640
Jo Delgadillo: And I told them that, and then I go check my messages and I don't know what, oh yeah, the dog place called and said they left messages that are going to check and she sent me like 20 messages.

59
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:35.700
Jo Delgadillo: About this, and that the baby shower and me running her. She's still out and I've told her no all we got for I couldn't take her and she kept telling me, well, this person can't take me for him. I can't take me kitty can't take me so I just I stopped messaging her

60
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:47.190
Jo Delgadillo: Right, so it works on that part only because I didn't see it. After a while, so I figured if I left it alone. But no, it wasn't. And then my son kind of put me on a guilt trip.

61
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:57.240
Jo Delgadillo: And then it was mad at me last week because he'll come up to me and we went everybody went bowling and I told her I don't think she should bow, because it's slippery.

62
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:06.930
Jo Delgadillo: And she got mad crossroads and and walked away. And then my son's like can have money. And as soon as I give him money Peter he disappeared. I didn't know where he what

63
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:14.790
Jo Delgadillo: He didn't come back to after he was out of money and then I was like, why didn't you go I spent $90 on everybody to bowl and you take off and

64
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.540
Jo Delgadillo: He's like, well, she can pull. I can pick up. She's pregnant. I was like, No, you shouldn't let her do that she needs.

65
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:39.030
Jo Delgadillo: To she is pregnant, she's protecting her baby. It's not that I didn't want her to bowl. It's just, it's very slippery, like maybe kept falling. We kept slipping and that's why I was. I see. She doesn't need the ball. All he seen it. Was she can't do it. I'm not doing it just it's annoying.

66
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mentioned guilt. Why, sorry.

67
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.030
Yeah.

68
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where does that come from.

69
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:59.850
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know, maybe my grandma She puts me on guilt trips on like when I do stuff for other people, like a part of it seems like she's jealous. But she tries to make me feel guilty. A lot

70
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:09.780
Jo Delgadillo: Like I wouldn't got my nails unfilled two weeks ago with Mercedes and her cousin, which is transgender, he's a boy he dresses like a woman.

71
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:17.490
Jo Delgadillo: Boy, and he's she just got mad. She was she didn't really get mad. She's like, I'm hurt and I couldn't hear.

72
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:28.560
Jo Delgadillo: Them all. And he she was like, I'm heard that you took them. You didn't take me and you owe me money. And as I told you, tell me how much money you want, I'll give it to you, but she was just like, well you I shouldn't have to ask

73
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.820
Jo Delgadillo: I asked you two days ago, how much money and now you're coming out with, like, kind of like tell us she seen on Facebook. They didn't check in.

74
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:44.370
Jo Delgadillo: She tried to make me feel guilty because I own her money and it did. So I was like, how much money do you want as soon as we got home, my sister.

75
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.460
Jo Delgadillo: She wouldn't give me a number. She won't even tell me she's just like, no way. And I'm like what you just put me on a whole guilt trip.

76
00:08:50.850 --> 00:09:04.620
Jo Delgadillo: When I was at the mall. When I couldn't even hear you. And I kept telling her on a call you back or let me I'll be home and a little bit because we were we stay there on the weekends and she just kept going on. I can't believe you would leave and I needed my nails filled to

77
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.800
Jo Delgadillo: All wanted to get out with no kids, no nobody. I just wanted to get out and

78
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.450
Think

79
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.620
Jo Delgadillo: She makes me feel guilty for like wanting to go out

80
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.420
Jo Delgadillo: If I leave the babies were you at when he came back. And it's not just her it's

81
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:34.440
Jo Delgadillo: When are you coming kids are going to print they're crying will handle it date. Where's the wipes really look for them. Like they'll literally be right next to him and he will call me asking for wipes and

82
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.870
Jo Delgadillo: It's like no one can function.

83
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.410
Jo Delgadillo: Especially with the dog.

84
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:46.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think makes you attract these type of personalities that are dependent on

85
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.340
Jo Delgadillo: Because I do it.

86
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: enable it.

87
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.820
Jo Delgadillo: So,

88
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:08.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's like the question earlier, if this is her first baby. And if you didn't get involved, who would step up the message you played over and over your head is that I have to do it or no one else

89
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:17.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's that all or nothing thinking and that's sometimes where that that power complex comes into

90
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because remember we talked about the drama triangle and you share that you're the rescuer it tends to accommodate and try to save a lot of people. And so in that rescue a role. It also has

91
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The characteristics of power.

92
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And someone that has power. They tend to attract people that want to be well

93
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:49.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There'll be a conflict that there's another leader or another person seeking power that's why sometimes is that conflicts.

94
00:10:50.670 --> 00:11:01.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any people that you attract or in your community in your system that are also leaders that are also rescuers.

95
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:04.680
Jo Delgadillo: Like

96
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.150
Jo Delgadillo: Around me no

97
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.860
Jo Delgadillo: No, no.

98
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.140
Jo Delgadillo: Not at all.

99
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know why.

100
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because, you know,

101
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.950
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. And a lot of people that that are kinda like that they people feel like I'm intimidating.

102
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:34.260
Jo Delgadillo: Because I'm just so used to speak up for everybody in my house and everyone does, though. Like, look at me. And I'm starting up sometimes. So it's pressure

103
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah I contribute to your anxiety.

104
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:48.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what you're trying to work on your anxiety, but the behaviors are working in opposite, we're not working together to help you reduce your and

105
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:58.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What could you do different to allow for victims to transition to a rescue row.

106
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.620
Jo Delgadillo: Help them to show to do things for yourself.

107
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.920
Jo Delgadillo: Or at least help them a few times, help them to do things for themselves.

108
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what happens when you help

109
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:29.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So pride that you try that in the past, you've left your husband alone and you know you thought this well. But what is he dead because you

110
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, and he says something stupid like you said like, where's the white and you probably tell them, it works right here. And this is that, and then cause again a call second

111
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what it does is it conditions him to not have to think on his own. I'll just call Joe should probably get irritated and she probably just come home sooner.

112
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because she'll

113
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just deal with it.

114
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.760
Jo Delgadillo: Ever done

115
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.520
Jo Delgadillo: With everyone

116
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the minute you

117
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Stepped in for the baby shower.

118
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And everyone else.

119
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:15.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They just fell in line. They went back to the victim role because Joe. The Rescuers here.

120
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why I said, what would it because

121
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:34.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have a strong belief that if you had use this opportunity to create that strong boundaries and you decided that you weren't going to do the baby shower someone else would have

122
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even if no one else did well be the worst case scenario if no one can debate.

123
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Over

124
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.580
Yeah.

125
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.710
Yeah.

126
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.830
Jo Delgadillo: Just something that just wouldn't happen.

127
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.740
Jo Delgadillo: I don't really know anyone so I didn't really invite anyone. Everybody knows in Texas.

128
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.520
Jo Delgadillo: And her mom supposedly is coming and her ex boyfriend this cup to her ex boyfriends are coming

129
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.190
Jo Delgadillo: And my first son is like so unlike know and she's like, Oh, don't worry about it.

130
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:24.480
Jo Delgadillo: They're just my best friend. And I'm like, wait a minute. When you were hanging out with Jacob and you had a boyfriend. That's what you were telling your boyfriend in front of my son, and we all heard it. Now my center boyfriend. That doesn't make me feel any more comfortable like

131
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.890
Jo Delgadillo: My son, used to be the best friend and now you're with him.

132
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.590
Jo Delgadillo: Like, yes, I feel bad for him on that part. I haven't said nothing.

133
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:44.040
Jo Delgadillo: He's if I go to him with what she's telling me, I'll be a bad guy and I don't want to be. I want to be there and be like, I want to catch him when

134
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:59.310
Jo Delgadillo: She screws up so my grandma's paint playing bad guy like putting your foot down, stop spending money stop my news and just like come to me and he's been calling me telling me everything but he doesn't know that

135
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.930
Jo Delgadillo: Doesn't go tell him anything we keep it between us do

136
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.270
Jo Delgadillo: Yes need somebody to go to one of us. So, and I was like I mom, I WANT TO BE GOOD guy You're a bad guy. Yeah.

137
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:25.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in that in that situation. I heard that it's hard to let go the rescue around you like appearing like a good person.

138
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.340
Hmm.

139
00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.160
Jo Delgadillo: Cuz I used to be horrible.

140
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:38.370
Jo Delgadillo: I used to be like when I was on drugs. I hated who I was and I didn't know who that person was because I was that person at the time.

141
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:49.590
Jo Delgadillo: When I started to get clean and I was looking at the people I was around. I was like, holy crap. That was me, like, was I doing that. I do that. And I'm like, yeah.

142
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.190
Jo Delgadillo: They were my partner crying like yeah we're idiots treating people horrible.

143
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.990
Jo Delgadillo: will not regret it.

144
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:03.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it possible that that guilt contributes to your needs to be a rescuer yeah

145
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.590
Probably

146
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.810
Jo Delgadillo: Because I used to think my shipping state and oh my god I was

147
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.130
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah so stuck up and hateful and

148
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.950
Jo Delgadillo: Such and I look back, and I'm like, How did I didn't know and kill me.

149
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.140
Jo Delgadillo: I was pretty hateful

150
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:32.220
Jo Delgadillo: And if I if I didn't like someone i'm not i probably sleep with their dad or brother or their husband. Like, that's how horrible. I was

151
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.200
Jo Delgadillo: Sucks.

152
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because not that person anymore.

153
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:51.420
Jo Delgadillo: I'm not and still people still treat me like I'm still that person, and I think it's my fault because I don't give nobody a chance to find out like I'm not that person because it's scary letting people come around us are letting them in our little bubble

154
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.110
Jo Delgadillo: Scary cuz every time I love someone and they do something stupid.

155
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.690
Jo Delgadillo: Like the guy that I'm the one that I said that he says he's transgender

156
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:14.670
Jo Delgadillo: I found out he wrote, he raped Roman which is his second cousin and reminisce a little boy that's my stepdaughters best friend.

157
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.230
Jo Delgadillo: Used to come over here. That's the one that used to tell me all the time that he was gay.

158
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.420
Jo Delgadillo: He he.

159
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:32.250
Jo Delgadillo: He raped him and supposedly cops got involved and they generate kit and they found his DNA when I'm like why isn't he in jail. None of it.

160
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:41.400
Jo Delgadillo: And then I feel like horrible in myself because I was around him and took him to get his nails done with us and we went to the mall. Like, we wouldn't eat.

161
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:50.730
Jo Delgadillo: Now, I'm like, why didn't anyone tell me I would never do that to Roman Roman and I feel like I retreat before it.

162
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was called in already

163
00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:04.920
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, supposedly, I didn't like I heard about the story. When I met Devon Roman all them isn't someone had did something to him, and it's screwed him up a little and that's why he was doing

164
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:12.750
Jo Delgadillo: Therapy at school like talking to a therapist like once a week at school. I knew about that, but it never went any further like into detail.

165
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:25.500
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't push it if she was comfortable enough to tell me what she told me, and then that's cool with that, man. Now I'm just like, holy crap that's what he was telling me about, and it was him. I had no clue.

166
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:36.120
Jo Delgadillo: And then I and it was weird because I was talking crap about pedophiles, when we were at the mall eating after we did our nails and he got this like

167
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.430
Jo Delgadillo: A SHAME THAT shamefaced I can't explain it, but his face. I was like, what was that face like I felt like it thinking about what was that

168
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.950
Jo Delgadillo: What was that face and then three days later, or say this is like, did you hear what why I won't isn't like Danny in our house in her house around Roman

169
00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:00.330
Jo Delgadillo: And I was like, no one in there. I was like, is that she goes, What and I will say, I heard a story about room and something happened to him.

170
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:10.500
Jo Delgadillo: A few years ago, which was a few years ago when I met him. She's like, Yeah. And I was like, I'm was a Danish. She was like, yeah, and I was like I was like oh like

171
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:22.080
Jo Delgadillo: Why didn't you told me before I would have never been around him. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE'S LIKE, SO YOU HEARD ABOUT heard about it and I was like, not tells but I heard about a situation

172
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.230
Jo Delgadillo: She was just like, yeah, it was pretty bad. And he raped him in front of his other brother, Josh.

173
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.580
Jo Delgadillo: And there's there there's 12 and 14 now.

174
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.110
Jo Delgadillo: And that just it hurts me to my core because

175
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.700
Jo Delgadillo: They're my friends kids like I've seen a part of their life. That makes me feel bad for them.

176
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.490
Jo Delgadillo: Sucks. And now that

177
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:51.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

178
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:03.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're going to reiterate a role, just because I think you're aware of it, but I want to make sure that you want as a therapist, whatever you say is kept confidential. But I have a requirement to report.

179
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:14.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If I feel that is the danger to yourself, or if there's any type of abuse, abandonment or neglect in regards to a child. So that's why I asked for this call did

180
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It wasn't then I would need to get the necessary information to call it in. Well, I would have to inform you, so that you could call it in to ensure that it goes to the proper measures investigation and

181
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:40.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just for future conversations when you think of because now is that requirement that I would have to call it in because I'm in another state and makes it a little more complicated about. No, I wouldn't have any information on individuals.

182
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But for you.

183
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you have this conversation. You say the person said he was awake picked on, and the nation. Okay.

184
00:20:51.240 --> 00:21:06.240
Jo Delgadillo: If that they took. They took him to the hospital did a rape kit and then the cop Scott a statement from Josh because he was there in the room, or the one that happened. Yeah, and they should probably detail about so i don't i don't understand why he's in jail.

185
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:20.640
Jo Delgadillo: If all that went down. Why is he like and why was I've seen him in the same like he was he's been outside. He's been a living room around him like, but I've never seen them interact with explained it.

186
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:32.520
Jo Delgadillo: To the store one day, everyone piled in but Roman and I was like why don't want to go, everybody's like, he was like, can you just give me an icy knows I sure didn't think twice about it now. It all makes sense.

187
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.460
Jo Delgadillo: Why would his mom even let him go around and he needs to be in jail.

188
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:46.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And as a mom of young children put putting parameters in place that he doesn't have access to

189
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Files.

190
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.520
Jo Delgadillo: I mean, it was around eight it. Yeah.

191
00:21:51.870 --> 00:22:01.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Kind of files, they will repeat the offenses when given an opportunity is something that's embedded in them and they will continue to repeat until they are

192
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:19.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Incarcerated and they don't have access to it so you can any inkling your body, you don't have all you have to do is call it in your information is kept confidential and he just give them investigators the information we need so that they could move forward.

193
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.620
Jo Delgadillo: I will. I gotta wait a little bit so Mercedes. I don't think it was me.

194
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:31.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah yeah yeah you know the number to report in New Mexico. Yeah.

195
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.320
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I got I got the number one, I called for the neighbor. They gave me for the children and the adults.

196
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So with with all that squared away, um,

197
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:54.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is there anything that I need to do to assist you or to help you have more ease with this situation with with the guy and Roman and add

198
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.360
Jo Delgadillo: He's messaging me he wants. He's having a baby shower.

199
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:09.000
Jo Delgadillo: It's just uncomfortable because I want Roman there. I don't have, I have to tell them no on there. They're the type of people that if when you

200
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.670
Jo Delgadillo: Give me an example. Deb is the cousin and they used to have a neighbor name and I

201
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:23.160
Jo Delgadillo: Got it all because and I he said that she didn't want Danny over there. Danny didn't even live there. She went over there and beat her up.

202
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:33.150
Jo Delgadillo: Out of her own house and beer. I didn't go to jail. Nothing. No. Call the cops cops came because the neighbors, but no one spoke up. No one said nothing. That's just the way that family works.

203
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:52.830
Jo Delgadillo: That's why I'm like, I have to wait until because if they know either do something to my kids, me and they know where my grandma lives. So that's why I had to wait till blows over. But yeah, it's just it's nerve racking because just the way they think is it's twisted. Yeah, it's not normal.

204
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:53.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

205
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.170
Jo Delgadillo: And I know they all do drugs. He told me he's been doing cocaine and crystal meth. That's what he told me

206
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:11.250
Jo Delgadillo: He said he said another word that I've never even heard that's why I didn't understand. And it kind of like went in one ear and out the other. And then he said it again asking me, I guess he wanted me to know if I wanted

207
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:23.460
Jo Delgadillo: To talk to him. He's been messaging me and he even had his mom messaged me and then she wrote me on Facebook on a comment, she commented on Facebook and I wouldn't

208
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:35.700
Jo Delgadillo: I wouldn't even check it, because you can see how it pops up before and I could just see the beginning. She was like, then needs his nails filled and I was just like, meet you, but I'm just, I don't, I can't

209
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.860
Jo Delgadillo: I don't, I don't know if I don't want to confront him because and that's just bringing it up.

210
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.300
Like

211
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:58.110
Jo Delgadillo: I have to say something. I was gonna say some other do something. Anyways, I was just waiting to Mercedes PR guy and maybe he forgot he wasn't around anymore and you didn't want to be around me. And yeah, I was gonna

212
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think it's a bit is definitely wise to call it in

213
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:12.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just to make sure that he doesn't have access to any of the children. He should be registered as a sex offender if there was any conviction.

214
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:31.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If the investigation happened and it was closed and it was closed and you wouldn't need to register as a sex offender. But if, in the event that there was no evidence, but he's still around children and you have an instinct or someone tells you that he's still doing these things then

215
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, call it in definitely to protect the children.

216
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if you want to provide me all the information I could call it in myself.

217
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:51.450
Jo Delgadillo: See, I don't even know where they're at. Yeah. All I seen was at the funeral. I was when I seen that we picked me up from an apartment.

218
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.810
Jo Delgadillo: I don't even think they live there because they're all of them. The whole family never, never have seven kids and they're homeless.

219
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:13.950
Jo Delgadillo: They've got six of them were them and then the rest of the family. There are homeless. They like jumping everywhere. And ever since I've known him for almost three years, maybe four, yeah. Almost four when Jay Jay turn toward and they've all been like that. That's how they've always lived

220
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.450
Jo Delgadillo: In

221
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: India therapy about this environment because

222
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.570
Jo Delgadillo: One time I promise I don't I do not put myself in those situations. I know better, cuz I know me.

223
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm. Yeah. Because now you're in this situation in which

224
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Requires the need to be the rescuer

225
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, to

226
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:54.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: An issue so unfortunate that there's people like business world. And so there's those opportunities when yes definitely necessary to become that rescue

227
00:26:54.570 --> 00:27:01.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm just hearing these common themes. The elderly woman across the street and what she was going through and now

228
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:09.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Danny and just these these people and these different with the lifestyles and behaviors that gets you immersed in it.

229
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:22.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even if you don't want to be a part of it, the rescuer in you, whether a Sharma be taken that has to rise up because now we're talking about one of the people that needs to be protected, but um

230
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's also concerning that these people are so attracted to wanting to to hang out with you.

231
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:36.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So there's different barriers of protection that you will need to put in place so that these people can see that you know what

232
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:56.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can be friendly to we won't mesh well she won't understand us and that might be hard for you to set because I know you want to appear. Good. You want to be like you want to restore all the past representation that you had. But now you're a different person.

233
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:18.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And taken on that mindset that you're different. It's uncomfortable, it's challenging, but you need to move from the past and what people think you're wanting to redeem yourself and being this good likable person to just Jill the sober stable person is trying to do better for myself.

234
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.740
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, that's what I tell people I'm a work in progress.

235
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.890
Jo Delgadillo: Shirt as a work in progress.

236
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.210
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah yeah

237
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely, because

238
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:40.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I remember you mentioning group that you feel anxious throughout certain times of the day. I can't really recall verbatim what you said.

239
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot. Yeah.

240
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.630
Jo Delgadillo: Like when I take her to school when I when I'm going to pick her up when James taking a nap like

241
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:57.960
Jo Delgadillo: Author of the day when she doesn't take a nap. It's when my husband's driving to work. And then when he's driving home.

242
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:08.910
Jo Delgadillo: Like, even though we got a new car. I still worry because he's got a car and there's these little like stuff that goes through here like I don't think normal people think that that

243
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Literally, what are you doing when those thoughts come

244
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are you doing when those thoughts come to

245
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.980
Jo Delgadillo: Me like going to sleep marketing driving

246
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.470
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, it's scary.

247
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:39.690
Jo Delgadillo: And then forgetting. I forget everything and it scares me a lot that I forget. So easy. Like I feel like an old person, sometimes with no memory. Yeah.

248
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:50.460
Jo Delgadillo: Like I don't like it. And when I was younger, a teenager was about 19 they did a test and they said it's because of all the scar tissue in my brain.

249
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.010
Jo Delgadillo: My head that I'm a goner.

250
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.020
Jo Delgadillo: That's scary.

251
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you have a head injury and

252
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:15.630
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, and I had a crack at my school is cracked all the way they say like a y and then it goes down, all the way to the back and then when I got older, my mom beat me and with the bruises on my grandparents found out. So she started to beat me in the head because it didn't leave marks.

253
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.560
Jo Delgadillo: So turn my eyes to blood and yeah

254
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:27.120
Jo Delgadillo: I would get black eyes. Yeah. And then I guess you know it started with headaches like

255
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:34.290
Jo Delgadillo: Just a slight headache, but never went away and then they went away all of a sudden for like a week or two, and then they came back in the room migraines.

256
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.860
Jo Delgadillo: Or I would pass out my nose with lead like and I would hear like the TV like coming in and out.

257
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:49.110
Jo Delgadillo: scary thought I had a brain tumor. And I just kept doing all these tests. And then finally, and they sent me to another doctor and he was like, it has to be

258
00:30:49.560 --> 00:31:01.500
Jo Delgadillo: The scar tissue because it's like her brain. Right. It has to be swelling something he doesn't know. So they did test like every three months they did it like clockwork. I had to go in

259
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.220
A long

260
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.800
Jo Delgadillo: Long time ago in and then all of a sudden the migraines just went away.

261
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:19.110
Jo Delgadillo: like or don't like you would never happen. And then I would get a headache here and there but I already know what to do. What I would get them. Yeah, it was. It was scary because I thought I was gonna die.

262
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.990
Jo Delgadillo: Like, be careful, like, Oh, I can hit my head and it. I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

263
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.740
Jo Delgadillo: Like I could barely hit it scary.

264
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Traumatic brain injury.

265
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:44.340
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know. I don't even remember all that. All I know is they said, just be careful not my they told my grandma all the important stuff. Is it the way I was forgetting was scaring me.

266
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.190
Jo Delgadillo: And then migraine on top of it.

267
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.770
Jo Delgadillo: I was losing my mind.

268
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.320
Jo Delgadillo: And everybody thought I was lying.

269
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, what, what things are you putting in place to help with during

270
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.670
Jo Delgadillo: Staying away from everybody.

271
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.420
Jo Delgadillo: I know it all week. I've been stayed away for the past two, three weeks seven staying away from

272
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.710
Jo Delgadillo: Hold on.

273
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.500
Jo Delgadillo: Let me run in and get my keys.

274
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.990
Jo Delgadillo: Music when I drive

275
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:46.560
Jo Delgadillo: Here we are.

276
00:33:50.070 --> 00:34:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Talking about what you've been putting in place to help managing anxiety and you said sand away from the stressful people. And I think that's good.

277
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we thought about this in steps. I think we're ready for the next step, because that step one was identifying the external systems. So you identified some people

278
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:29.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're hearing information about new individuals. And so you're trying to figure out how do I separate myself now is when we go to the next step. Step two. We looked on the outside. Now do the work with it. What is it that I'm doing that contributes to my inside

279
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.520
Jo Delgadillo: overthinking

280
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:45.060
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah yeah I'm constantly in my head. That's why I can always keep myself busy. So I don't think too much because I go to a bad place and

281
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.150
Jo Delgadillo: I have to constantly say stay busy.

282
00:34:50.190 --> 00:35:00.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can say with anxiety is you want to be aware, aware of it. And there's an acronym that actually helps so that you can identify more steps to help with that and

283
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:08.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So aware that a is starting with acknowledging that the anxieties there.

284
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:17.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you acknowledge that the anxiety is there. What do you do, so we're just going to stay there on that step right now.

285
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:23.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you acknowledge that there have been awareness. So that's catching it.

286
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:31.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that then you can stop the fat. We talked about in the group. And I'm not sure if everyone gets it sometimes, but the thought stopping

287
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is very important in catching behaviors so that she can rewire the brain rewire your body's response. And then, in turn, remove or eliminate the symptom. So the symptom right now is things if

288
00:35:50.220 --> 00:36:06.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We want to catch the five, you have to be aware of it, you're good that you able to tell me specific places and driving my kids to school, my husband's in the car. These are people that you love the anxiety is centered around the people that you love.

289
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:15.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is also the element of that control and that power that comes into because the people you love is also your territory.

290
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where he say a very protective bubble

291
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when I say, you know,

292
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.510
Jo Delgadillo: Very controlling some that are doing

293
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:25.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

294
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.290
Jo Delgadillo: Also

295
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:40.740
Jo Delgadillo: One more. I feel like I am more anxiety again. So I tried to like I have to like for their sake, especially at my nose a teenager myself teenager I don't let them do anything. He didn't go nowhere to be around, nobody

296
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.740
Jo Delgadillo: And now I'm finding out how sneaky us he's telling me now that he's older and I'm like, Really, I screwed up like

297
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:47.970
Jo Delgadillo: I'm going to

298
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.120
Jo Delgadillo: His business but I'm gonna let them.

299
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.110
Jo Delgadillo: Have a little bit of freedom. I asked your he's going to be speaking

300
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.090
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah yeah

301
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:07.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So finding that balance because, as a parent, you need to have some protective capacity that protective capacity warrants needing some level of control and power.

302
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:23.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You need that. But right now we see there's an inbound so we're still on the A and aware be awareness. So when you see it, you recognize that the anxiety is coming in is because by now, when you take care of the body.

303
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:30.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you're noticing you're anxious. Pretty sure you're breathing is probably different. We think about it.

304
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I see your chest movie. Now is there even

305
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:34.620
Jo Delgadillo: There.

306
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:48.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I can see you, uh, you know, exhaling. What we want to do is focus more on the 711 reading. So you're going to inhale seven seconds, it's going to be longer. Exhale.

307
00:37:50.550 --> 00:38:00.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we'll practice it. Right. So inhale 1234567 Excel 123678

308
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:09.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Inhale 1234567 excellent 1234568

309
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:12.150
Is back with

310
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:14.850
Jo Delgadillo: Jordan.

311
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:19.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, well, we were talking before we did the breathing. I could see

312
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I could see it. And when you were excelling. It was short breaths, but with the 711 breathing technique, you're exhaling longer that's telling your body to go into a calm states when we're anxious, we tend to inhale more Excel less

313
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.030
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

314
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when you want to relax your it's hailing more

315
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we're going to try it again, but this time I want you to put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach.

316
00:38:55.350 --> 00:39:13.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when you breathe in, for the seven building your chest. But when you exhale push it all the way out and fill your beliefs. Okay, one more time, inhale 1234567 Excel 12345678

317
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In him 1234567

318
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Exhale 2345678 months and

319
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:33.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Accelerate even slower because you literally want to feel your belly expanding like you're blowing air into that building.

320
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.010
Okay.

321
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.980
1-234-567-1234 567

322
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.530
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah yeah

323
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: overthinking the breathing. Yeah, even though we're thinking the brain.

324
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is fine. Okay.

325
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, what ready

326
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:26.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Inhale smoke to the seven exhale slower. So inhale 1-234-561-2341 234567

327
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.140
Excellent.

328
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, there you go. How does your body feel

329
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:37.590
Jo Delgadillo: Joy.

330
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.960
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, yeah. Even in here. I was like, yeah.

331
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.580
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

332
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:53.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we're right we're taking care for brain because now the brain is acknowledging. There's a variety that's visited

333
00:40:54.180 --> 00:41:01.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now you're preparing your body to release it, because when you have anxiety. You want to discharge it won't let it go.

334
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:13.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That'll be additional steps we work on before right now want you to focus on acknowledging that anxiety when it comes it say, all right, this feels like enzyme

335
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:32.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The awareness and then the breathing to get your body in mind that you're not in distress, you're on a calm state and the more you do it, when those he stops visit the more your body will respond to the situation in a calm state.

336
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:40.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you never taught your body before that your kids want to school is an okay thing to be afraid.

337
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, but when you if you drop them off and your brain always goes into that anxious mode that what if this. What if this and panic mode.

338
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your body will continue to to be tense.

339
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even when you drive a to get that back into your body. You may notice you probably driving tense, we may feel it in your lower back. You may feel it in your stomach or your chest.

340
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.250
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I feel it up here. Yeah.

341
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.250
Yeah.

342
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.100
Jo Delgadillo: So temps.

343
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.590
Jo Delgadillo: Are you driving like that.

344
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:20.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

345
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:28.560
Jo Delgadillo: It helps because it starts to get it hurts minutes drops and I know it's because of stress and I tend to

346
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, we need to work on the catching the thought. And now once we

347
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:41.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will see we're sending that signal to the brain. There is an intruder here.

348
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now you're preparing your body

349
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To discharge that anxiety to tell the anxiety that it can't visit you.

350
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's going to come

351
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:59.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But until you retrain your brain and your body

352
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:10.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's going to continue to come and it's going to intensify if you don't train it because probably in the past. It wasn't as bad.

353
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But probably getting more and more intense.

354
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:23.220
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, the more now the jailers in school and he works farther and we're here and edge would like and now this coronavirus

355
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.940
Jo Delgadillo: Like everyone's going crazy everywhere.

356
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:46.860
Jo Delgadillo: It's no and now three people here in New Mexico have confirmed have it and like, yeah, it's getting bad they're talking about closing everything down. Like all any school activity Monster Jam was this weekend, and a whole bunch of other things. It's all cancel everything. Yes.

357
00:43:49.980 --> 00:44:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it's it's like the epidemic. It's a crisis. And so a lot of things. It makes sense to have to shut down. This is going to be so bad for tourism travel and cities, making money.

358
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Back. Yeah.

359
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:09.270
Jo Delgadillo: People are freaking out there, staring each other. Yeah, yeah, it's just, it's like a domino effect.

360
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.190
Jo Delgadillo: Like there's no sanitizer. You're only allowed to buy one at a time. If you do I sanitizer.

361
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:26.010
Jo Delgadillo: Like their signs everywhere saying, when you buy sanitizer or any kind of cleaning products even additional you're only allowed to buy one at a time or per person.

362
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm not sure because we brought a lot of us stuff like when it was in in another country site come in and be prepared. So I don't know if they put those restrictions on now because

363
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:48.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's bad to worse. You got us up like maybe a week or week and a half ago, could you like it's picking up. We have people here now that habit multiple people everywhere.

364
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.080
Jo Delgadillo: But I'm trying not to go there because that's one less thing. I don't

365
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.360
Jo Delgadillo: Freak out myself out what's, what's it

366
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:14.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any more encouraging whenever I look at it, it's always older people that are have health issues. So their body is more compromised and their immune system is suppressed. So, you know, they're more susceptible to get it.

367
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.720
Jo Delgadillo: With her

368
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So she needs to just make they, you know, away from public

369
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.150
Jo Delgadillo: And I remember let her go nowhere.

370
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:30.570
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, yeah. I'm like, Nope. She can't go. I'll go and everybody's like, why she wants to get out. I'm like, I don't care.

371
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.730
Jo Delgadillo: I'll go to the support

372
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I want to

373
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Play something for you because I want you to really

374
00:45:44.160 --> 00:46:03.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: get accustomed to this this breathing mode and see it because I want to want to work with you more individually one because I think you respond well to the information and having this therapy and having these resources will help in every aspect of your life.

375
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.980
Jo Delgadillo: And they are like I'm taking in. And I'm telling anybody ever just like you're changing only. Thank you.

376
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Good, but

377
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it comes to the check and I see some

378
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:33.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People without the April, they get so anxious when the medication check in the more therapy, you have the anxiety isn't even there as much because you're like, you know what I really don't need medication at a high bills to function I have more skills under my belt to help me.

379
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.790
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, and I think I'm good at it with the whinging like tapering off.

380
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:47.580
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, scared me to death. And I was like, kind of mad, like, Oh, she just wants me off. She's in here and now i'm glad like really

381
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are you at now.

382
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.770
Jo Delgadillo: I'm at seven. But I think the less than that.

383
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.760
Jo Delgadillo: I'm not sure because I suck at the whole measuring thing.

384
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

385
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.090
Jo Delgadillo: It says on there, seven, eight, sir. I don't even know how to say it, but

386
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:19.860
Jo Delgadillo: I think I'm taking less than seven because I just I tear a piece off of it. And I think it's more than seven. I had to break it in half, it would be for another piece and it would be at least six, I think, yeah, I think I might be on six but she said seven so I'm like,

387
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.010
Jo Delgadillo: If I can get down to four. I remember her telling those other people that there's another thing that she can put them on and

388
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:27.540
Jo Delgadillo: I'm

389
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.950
Jo Delgadillo: Like in my mind. I want to be off for the summer when I'm not going to push myself.

390
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:33.840
Jo Delgadillo: Because I do this.

391
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Place you

392
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:42.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Could you could get some more excuse me about to help out with all domains with your life with the anxiety.

393
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:51.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then be able to say I'm on a very low dose of the Suboxone I don't need medication to function in life. I have the skill to have the tools.

394
00:47:51.690 --> 00:48:06.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To function in life and you teach your kids this these resources and helping them manage their anxiety. It's as a parent, one of the most rewarding things where you not only can protect them, but you can help them and how to deal with everyday life stressors.

395
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:16.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Share this with you because maybe seeing someone else. Still, it will help the group.

396
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:30.150
That will do a demonstration of dive chromatic breathing.

397
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:40.470
But I'd first like you to do is put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach and we're gonna take three deep breaths just normal deep breaths.

398
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:58.350
Good. Did you feel that top hand really moving as you breathe.

399
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:09.360
And when we're stressed that tends to be the type of breathing that we engage us is that chest breathing, where the the shoulders rise and fall. And there's some tension there.

400
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:20.280
So when we do diaphragm matic breathing. We're going to push that breath down lower into the stomach and instead of that chest moving. It's going to remain nice and steady.

401
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:30.930
While your lower hand rises and falls with your inhale and exhale. So as we take a breath in and out. You're going to breathe in through your nose.

402
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:42.240
And then out through your mouth slowing that breathing down and letting that air fill your belly as it goes down through the chest and expanding the belly.

403
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:58.380
And then as you exhale completely your belly is going to let go of all that air and completely exhale out. And your breath in, will be about four seconds and your exhale will be a little bit longer at six seconds.

404
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:06.750
So we're going to practice and I'd like will do about three breaths with me guiding you and I'll say, inhale.

405
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:27.150
234 exhale 23456 that exhale is a little bit longer than the inhale, so that we're getting all of that byproduct of our breathing out the inhale will be nice and steady and a nice steady exhale

406
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.040
So you can close your eyes and get comfortable.

407
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:38.730
And when you're ready, we'll take that first inhale breathing in through your nose.

408
00:50:39.780 --> 00:51:27.630
Inhale 234 exhale through the mouth 23456 and inhale 234 exhale 2345 sex. Inhale 234 exhale 23456 and I just like you to fall into a steady pattern of breathing continuing to breathe deeply

409
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.180
Filling the belly.

410
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.780
Exhaling out completely.

411
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:41.220
You may envision that there's a balloon that fills as you breathe in.

412
00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:58.140
And then as you exhale out all of the air from the balloon is release breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Maybe beginning to feel your shoulders relax.

413
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.700
Your jaw relaxes to

414
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:08.160
Have in your stomach begins to feel more comfortable.

415
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:14.880
Nice heavy limb some warm relaxation circulating throughout the body.

416
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.960
Just continue to breathe in a rhythm that's comfortable

417
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:32.910
Yeah.

418
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:38.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Could you imagine being able to do that, the next time that anxiety, visit

419
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.420
Yeah.

420
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.130
Jo Delgadillo: I could

421
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You could relax your body immediately.

422
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.280
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I feel, relax.

423
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:56.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relax. Yeah, yeah. So that's the first step will be working on additional steps, but I want you to practice that during the week.

424
00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I'm sure the the anxiety visits throughout the day. And so you want to identify when that anxiety is coming. Write it down. You already identified some things, but there's some other things that you're not aware of that's coming. And you practice those that really

425
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:23.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if there's people around, and you feel uncomfortable with your chest in the practice it at home so that even if you're in a public place you can be able to do it.

426
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so

427
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Does that work for you.

428
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.000
Jo Delgadillo: What we

429
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.410
Jo Delgadillo: Just got a message from my grandma. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, what time

430
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sorry. You came a little earlier. So do you want to do.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Five o'clock or seven o'clock.
