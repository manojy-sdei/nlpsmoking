00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's official. We are meeting.

4
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to meet. Yes, yes.

5
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to open up a note.

6
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you are, you have something to maybe a glass of water you're comfy.

7
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.470
Yeah.

8
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty good. Right. Okay. Excellent.

9
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I do right now is I'm just going to open up a note.

10
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm set like I'm propped up on something, I can tell. You've got me sort of set stationary

11
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.580
Samantha Scott: Yes, I have like three books to get my computer at the level

12
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it.

13
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go.

14
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There.

15
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we could kind of ease our way into this and maybe sort of transition from hey what has it been like to attend group and you start there.

16
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
Samantha Scott: It was, it was really good. I

17
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.770
Samantha Scott: I've never done that obviously talks. Well, I mean, I've never really talked honestly about my addiction.

18
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.860
Samantha Scott: I've always tried to be really honest about like my mental health struggles, like in general.

19
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.620
Samantha Scott: In public, you know, because I feel like it's important to

20
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.380
Samantha Scott: Normalize it you know

21
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.540
Samantha Scott: But

22
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.770
Samantha Scott: That said, like I've been talking like on the surface with issues that have to do with like addiction. I've never really been honest about that.

23
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.390
Samantha Scott: I felt different

24
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.530
Or

25
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the feeling when you caught yourself. Oh, I said a word. I can't believe I said that phrase. I can't believe I said this thing. What, what was the emotion when you were saying, You're right before you were saying it.

26
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.570
Samantha Scott: Mean shame but rapidly followed by pride, I guess.

27
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

28
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.390
Samantha Scott: Like the one that I'm programmed to feel and the other one that is like you know the real me, I guess.

29
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.150
Samantha Scott: Like oh, we're talking about all the beliefs and stuff. I mean, I feel like I've got a ton of those that maybe I'm not even aware of consciously, you know,

30
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's

31
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some, I believe.

32
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment as far as the psychotherapy. Right. Yeah. So when when you heard me say cognitive behavioral therapy. You're also familiar with DDT.

33
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: dialectically so you're actually you have some familiarity with addressing underlying beliefs, the feeding thoughts that we

34
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Have and of course then the the emotion that follows that that is one model and it is a powerful, powerful model. It's not the only way to view what we're up to.

35
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a useful one.

36
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.930
Samantha Scott: Especially in terms of like changing behaviors right i do i do kind of look at a CVT the cognitive behavioral theory as

37
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A technique I don't look to it as the etiology. The origin of early trauma. I look to attachment theory I look to object relations when I'm looking for a groundwork. In order to understand where we formulated this conditioning like

38
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: How could. How come I can't even remember how come I feel like I've been like this forever.

39
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then I will go more to psychodynamic perspectives there. So I do, I love, I love CVT, but I don't go to it for like my understanding of why people have been this way for so long.

40
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.520
Samantha Scott: Trauma so yeah yeah

41
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

42
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're probably on the same page there.

43
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.790
Samantha Scott: I think so. Seems like

44
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you were

45
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: talking earlier about. So was this feeling of shame. Did you notice shame.

46
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right before you're about to say something. Or maybe, did you notice Shane as Oh she's that blend. She's going to call on me soon I hear other people talking. Did it come up, then

47
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.900
Samantha Scott: Yeah, and the wall. I mean, it was more like I'm like dry I'm catching myself like being

48
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:35.580
Samantha Scott: Like, as I was saying it and like, I'd say it was more when I'm like waiting for the reaction. Maybe that's how I relate to the world's. You know what I mean.

49
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.430
Samantha Scott: Like, like where you're like,

50
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.530
Samantha Scott: What are they gonna think

51
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.600
Samantha Scott: Is that okay

52
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nice.

53
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Yes. So, so I want to go a little further back and you're giving me really good information. But I still want to be play detective here for a minute.

54
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Still see if you can remember what it was like to be listening to other people and almost being were you thinking

55
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to share this piece or I'm thinking, Oh, she shared that I'm going to

56
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: My piece and

57
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.320
What

58
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:22.470
Samantha Scott: That all sounds really familiar. Like I'm one of the when I was in college, like, one of the things that, like, really holds me back was like

59
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:35.700
Samantha Scott: A fear of saying something and not like the fear that, like, I'm not like I've read all the materials or whatever. Right. And I've collated the information but like

60
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:58.680
Samantha Scott: I still just feel this. Like, I mean, I guess it's like a fear of talking or fear of being judged or fear of being judged. I guess I kind of look at like my interactions with the world. Like I feel like I have to like think out all the different possible ramifications of everything.

61
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.520
Samantha Scott: Before I do it, which is not really possible, you know, but I try

62
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do one more thing. Can you let me just see something

63
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.920
Can you

64
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Push me back about three inches or so just pushed me back just to touch. I'd like to see more of you. Um, so I, yeah, I can see more of, you know,

65
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, thank you. So now we share about the same amount of body.

66
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Body. Yeah, a little

67
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.660
Bit more

68
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And similar. So I'm hearing

69
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me check in on how does your environment respond to this style of interacting with it. In other words, if I'm trying to look ahead and predict how how how is my environment going to respond to me. And then I'm okay well

70
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.440
Samantha Scott: never able to be fully present

71
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:12.570
Samantha Scott: Because I'm constantly like right like I'm constantly trying to either like deal with the last decision I made know the ramifications, or like the one I just made and haven't acted on yet, but it's still, you know,

72
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's your experience. I'm not selling cousin, this question has to do with how do people respond to that.

73
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.460
Samantha Scott: Oh, you mean how do people respond with me not being fully present

74
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's, that's really analytical let's go really, really simple. How do people take you. How did they respond to you.

75
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.460
Samantha Scott: I mean generally well

76
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:54.840
Samantha Scott: I because I'm just, I think it is because, I mean, I don't know what the right term is it for, but like empathetic or something like I'm really good at like mirror. I feel like I'm really good at mirroring people in like the real world. You know, I'm still not used to this.

77
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:14.460
Samantha Scott: To the, to the world. I'm getting used to it, but like I think it's more i don't know i think it's i feel like it has more to do with the fact that I am being really present and being aware of everything, then it does just me, you know,

78
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so when I heard you, Santa just want to clarify people receive you as

79
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're empathetic to them and you stand them. They're like, hey, look. She understands me. So, Samantha fans. So they're enjoying the fact that you care.

80
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.870
About

81
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.900
Samantha Scott: Yeah, totally.

82
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.940
Samantha Scott: But maybe I mean I guess it's hard to be like one of the things I really want to be in my life is authentic.

83
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:56.220
Samantha Scott: Like I'm i feel like i mean definitely all this, like in my head nervous.

84
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:05.070
Samantha Scott: To certain degree. It's fine. But like I feel like it is definitely preventing me from like being present in the present.

85
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.720
Samantha Scott: Okay.

86
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:21.030
Samantha Scott: You know, and to have real authentic interactions, because if I'm constantly analyzing everything. Like, I mean, I know I have to, to some degree, but like, you know, for safety or whatever but like I feel like I

87
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:28.170
Samantha Scott: I would like to to be able to express myself more without like so much fear of what

88
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.530
Samantha Scott: You know, is going to be perceived

89
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.680
Samantha Scott: That's beautiful. So we don't even need

90
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To pull out anymore. This what you just shared today is a lot. I think we could work with just that today. So I'd like to take what

91
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.730
Samantha Scott: We didn't have any of this in mind whenever we started our

92
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.510
Samantha Scott: Good and authentic.

93
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, oh, I forgot I have, I have to remind because people think I'm making fun of them or something. I haven't your condition. So I have to tilt my head, you'll probably acclimate to it and

94
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You can laugh at it every time. Some of the time. So when I do this. I'm clearing my air. Just do your best.

95
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.610
Samantha Scott: Okay. Okay, good.

96
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm glad I remember to say it again because people have gotten offended and and it really throws therapy off. I'm like,

97
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, it's not you. I have this condition. So here's but then it comes right back. I'm so sorry if it's disruptive. But my gut was

98
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.270
Samantha Scott: Telling me

99
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

100
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is over time you'll stop seeing it most of my clients. They don't even. They're like, I only remember you doing it anymore. It'll be that frequent

101
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's right now I'm looking at your goal. So let's see if we can tether what we just talked about.

102
00:11:46.980 --> 00:12:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Which came up authentically and you just informed me on that. Let's also see if it's connected to some of your goals that you said earlier. So one of the things, walking in the door with me was I want to successfully use medication for time ready to get the proper skills.

103
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to heal from childhood wounding oh

104
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I want that for you to I want more healthy coping skills and ability to interact with an imperfect world amen to that sister.

105
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.480
Samantha Scott: It's, it's, it is imperfect.

106
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.710
Yes.

107
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

108
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: coping skills. I wonder if that's the one right there.

109
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:40.230
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I mean I feel like I'm not even I'm not even sure what my unhealthy coping skills are besides like

110
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:48.990
Samantha Scott: Obviously using drugs. That's probably that's probably one of them. Definitely using opiates. That was like a coping.

111
00:12:49.560 --> 00:13:02.430
Samantha Scott: I mean, it was, it was a relief, but also it was more about like getting stuff done every day and being able to be on the level that I feel like I need to be at, you know, or whatever, it gets

112
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

113
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I got

114
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, I just love what you're saying, I'm going to put that in here so

115
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what you said earlier, I want my in headedness, I'm thinking that analysis.

116
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That prevents me

117
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: From being present.

118
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So what if it's what if it's over analysis. What if it's paralysis from analysis thing.

119
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.510
Samantha Scott: It is, I think, I definitely have some analysis paralysis.

120
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, those are fun phrases you know

121
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it calculates a lot, so we don't you know what I mean. Because you right

122
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.350
Samantha Scott: Yeah, totally. And headedness, I definitely i'm going to be using that one.

123
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That was yours in headedness, I've never heard it before. I don't

124
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how to spell that is on the thing just invented

125
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.470
Samantha Scott: I know. I think it's totally made up i i don't know maybe

126
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:15.090
Samantha Scott: It is a thing. You know, there's a thing where like you, you come up with a thing. And like, then somebody else and like another part of the world comes up with the same thing like

127
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.630
Seek

128
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.040
Samantha Scott: It.

129
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: out somehow. Yeah, I like it. So if we say I want more healthy coping skills.

130
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And so just now sort of organically. You said, Well, I don't know what unhealthy is. But then you answered yourself and you said, Well, I was sort of problem solving. I was solving was with a mood altering substance.

131
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to reach this expectation for myself and in order to reach this expectation for myself I deemed the solution is a substance, right, whether whether the expectation is a reasonable one or not. You and I don't know each other well enough to find

132
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Out I am curious. So over time, I'll get to know that.

133
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also identified before we review the goal. It's my in headedness that prevents me from being present. I want to be more present

134
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.570
Samantha Scott: You want

135
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: To be authentic. You also mentioned something earlier, which was

136
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're empathetic to other people.

137
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.290
Samantha Scott: Right and

138
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where I'd like to just focus on for just a quick second. Okay.

139
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to throw out some phrases he which one stick which ones don't.

140
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

141
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't my ears when you. Um, have you ever thought, Ah, I'm a people pleaser.

142
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, floor. Yeah, okay, or

143
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I care so much about other people. I kind of like haven't been refueling myself.

144
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.810
Samantha Scott: Yeah a lot. Okay.

145
00:15:49.470 --> 00:16:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's where when you were saying earlier when I said, Well, how, how does your environment respond to you. You said, well, they find me quite empathetic and, you know, yeah. So what if that skill you have which is empathy. I'm so glad you have it. A we need it to be a civilized

146
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Creature and community. We need to care about others to sort of resonate with others so that we don't take advantage of them. We don't kill them.

147
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.510
Right, right.

148
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:32.850
Samantha Scott: You know, there's a lot. I mean, it's particularly hard right now when like the person who's supposed to represent the entire you know country is like not modeling that behavior at all.

149
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll compartmentalize that for just a moment and come right back to it, we're on the same page so we don't have to even we're on the same page. No worries there same. So let's go to this adaptation

150
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You developed probably over time and adaptation

151
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Of caring about others.

152
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And it has served to

153
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You a lot like oh they stick around. We stay station. I feel rewarded by caring about others, you've gotten some some benefits from it.

154
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely it's an adaptation. What I wonder is, if it's been over adaptation

155
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:24.180
Samantha Scott: Probably. I think so. I mean, when I try to be conscious. I know. Like you're raised in the South.

156
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:40.950
Samantha Scott: You are raised in a different way than a lot of other people in this country and like just sort of belief systems, whether it's a really well. They're mostly mostly unhealthy ones. There's a little bit of charm. But there's a there's, you know, racism and

157
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.380
Samantha Scott: It's. I'm sorry. I kind of got off track there.

158
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good at that.

159
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.800
Okay.

160
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.950
Samantha Scott: Just remind me what I'm

161
00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm what what you had a response to and and I interrupted it a bit with the wanting to maybe talk about President for a second and you went to the south.

162
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then right. And what I did was talk about over adaptation. It's a phrase most

163
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.200
Samantha Scott: Views, right, because it's like we're trying to adapt adapt.

164
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.330
Samantha Scott: I'm not

165
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going further back.

166
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not even saying the South. I'm saying

167
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: In your home.

168
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.680
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

169
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.430
Samantha Scott: My home. It was not a healthy environment.

170
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's, let's just see because little people like you and I, we register, what's going to work on what's not going to work. We figured out pretty quickly.

171
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to get

172
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Our resources. What's going to get attention.

173
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.010
Samantha Scott: Right.

174
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to keep this parent figure around

175
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.730
Samantha Scott: Positive yeah with my mom, especially

176
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

177
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.560
Samantha Scott: I mean, yeah.

178
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Me just ask this pointed question.

179
00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This adaptation that you develop the one where you care about other if I care about other parent maybe mom oftentimes it's those um how early. Do you think

180
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You develop that I better care about the feelings of my caregiver or else

181
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.670
Samantha Scott: Guessing. I mean, knowing I don't know but

182
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm not

183
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.000
Samantha Scott: Really early like you know

184
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Mechanics came to mind just now.

185
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.830
Samantha Scott: Baby. Yeah.

186
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.410
Samantha Scott: Like looking at it's mom, you know, good.

187
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do analysis that you can let me do all that. Believe me, I got

188
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I got that you don't have to pay any of that.

189
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:53.700
Samantha Scott: Honestly, what came to my mind was an image of me looking up at my mom or if she was holding me and trying to like make her like me.

190
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

191
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay image.

192
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Of my mom holding me and I'm trying to make her like me.

193
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.090
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I'm like, looking up at her like that.

194
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get a sense of whole

195
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.330
Samantha Scott: Months.

196
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, you get a sense that you were months old.

197
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

198
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.520
Samantha Scott: like seven or eight months maybe

199
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.260
Samantha Scott: 10

200
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:43.530
Samantha Scott: I mean, definitely doesn't feel like one, but it gets so weird when you try to think back to like early on because it, I have this experience where like I feel like what I experienced wasn't real.

201
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, let's just sit with that for a little bit.

202
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you.

203
00:20:52.470 --> 00:21:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It was real and your body probably remembers it and the reason why you can't, it's this. Like, I can't quite give you an exact is because you didn't have language.

204
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

205
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.030
Samantha Scott: So that makes sense that makes

206
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense that part of the brain wasn't wasn't there yet, but our limbic system was going, and we were responding to our environment and trying to figure out who am I, where's this there's no sort of differentiation between self and other

207
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:21.900
Samantha Scott: Right, right.

208
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.550
Samantha Scott: Over a little bit about that. Yeah.

209
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

210
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what the emotion is you have right yeah what is

211
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.710
Samantha Scott: Sad.

212
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:40.650
Samantha Scott: Yeah, yeah. Well, not even just sad but like I feel sorry you know I feel sorry for me.

213
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That little baby.

214
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep.

215
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.190
Samantha Scott: The image of me. I feel sorry for the image of me.

216
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can turn to look how adaptive we are

217
00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yes, we can, we can feel an eye to I'm getting teary to it does I that's why I'm in this profession, right, I want

218
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I want the baby to have all the the healthy attachment

219
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And the truth is,

220
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Our parents

221
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Fail to do the necessary 30%

222
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.960
Samantha Scott: Right.

223
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:25.800
Samantha Scott: Right, everything. And I mean, I know you know you when you hear that you're like yeah and everybody else is coming from trauma that's in their lives and stuff but

224
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.140
Samantha Scott: But it doesn't

225
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.880
Samantha Scott: See right it's still there.

226
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what I'm going to do right now is I'm saying it's a both. And so, yes, it's sad to be with that feeling and how sad that maybe didn't get and it was you.

227
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.740
Samantha Scott: Were

228
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And there was this the sadness was there.

229
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But where I'm starting from this is where we get to play with the cognitive. This is where we get some changes. We get to say

230
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.980
Well,

231
00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that adaptation thing Bitcoin was talking about was she talking about that baby. Not only is she wired for a tournament and attachment and she was trying to do the right

232
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.880
Samantha Scott: Right, just a very natural thing. Yeah.

233
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

234
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is instinctual. Okay, we are social creatures. That's why our eyeballs are up here. That's why we have all of this and we'll go. I'll go into the Vegas system. Some other time but

235
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: My point is adaptation. So at a very, very early age you unconsciously sound like you had the words to describe how to adapt, you will naturally adapt to your environment, and you did it.

236
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.300
Samantha Scott: Right.

237
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So this adaptation adaptation of empathy caring about others will get you the resources of attention that you need.

238
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.290
Right.

239
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.660
Samantha Scott: Now,

240
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.910
Samantha Scott: Is that is a that is a good one. I mean, I feel like

241
00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.790
Samantha Scott: I feel like I've been thinking about all this stuff in my head, but like, it is really not possible to put it together by yourself, you

242
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's not. And here's the thing, and this is what's

243
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Been interesting because I've been doing this.

244
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well over 20 years and and you know I've done lots and lots of reading on my own. And I'm like, Why does it not feel the same right

245
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, why is it, why have a therapist watch us go read a self help book.

246
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.430
Samantha Scott: Right, right, right, right.

247
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.320
Samantha Scott: But I didn't. That is, that's

248
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:41.100
Samantha Scott: I mean I feel like I've done. I mean, I have done a ton of reading. So I feel like I am definitely at the point where I don't need to do any more reading right now I'm just going to try to be authentic and listen and interact authentically

249
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this is the piece that I think is

250
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's intuitive. Oh, it feels good to talk to a friend feels good to talk to a trusted otherwise I feel better after I shared

251
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.450
Samantha Scott: Or anybody in this situation.

252
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And there's that's for the same reason you were talking about as a baby, we are wired for connection.

253
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And the simplest explanation is if the trauma was interpersonal

254
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If the rupture was an attachment rupture or failure to develop and the healing is going to be in a personal

255
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:21.960
Samantha Scott: Right.

256
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can do that with a book.

257
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.650
Samantha Scott: Right, no totally

258
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.980
Samantha Scott: Right, especially when you've got in headedness

259
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So what they'll probably be the overarching approach with us.

260
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Will probably be this healing around what comes up for you in here. So they'll probably going to be some

261
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Some transference where I will take on some of those attributes of that caregiver. And so you might end up being angry.

262
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:59.250
Samantha Scott: Right. But I know that anger is a thing I can get through.

263
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

264
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're doing a lot very quickly right now, let me first. Let's take a deep breath, let's let's let's get in touch with body here real quick just nice inhale and let that air go deep into the long, not just a pie on the shoulders. But, but, inhale, expand that lower belly.

265
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, it all out. Just let it all go out the mouth.

266
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:34.560
Samantha Scott: I'm really need to remember to breathe. It's funny, isn't it. Oh, like humans. It's like, it's like the automatic breathing, but it's not

267
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go. I've got a lot to tell you about that. Lots and lots to learn lots to share

268
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's stay sort of narrowly focused on a couple of things.

269
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're not broken.

270
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing wrong with you.

271
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.540
Yeah.

272
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe that

273
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.110
Samantha Scott: I believe that

274
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And what may may happen in here is you may notice you may not want to show up to an appointment or you may notice resentment or you may notice a dynamic happening. And you may ask yourself.

275
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, why is this happening. It's not fair. And that may happen.

276
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I strongly encourage you to show up any way in here with me. Yeah.

277
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You show up angry.

278
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.190
Samantha Scott: Right, right.

279
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can sit with I'm angry and sit with sharing with me.

280
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking this, I believe this. I'm afraid of this, you said this. This is the meaning I made out of it. You can hang in there long enough.

281
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear another's perspective mine.

282
00:27:50.550 --> 00:28:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it could be someone else. But we're the only two interacting. So it'll be someone else's perspective. And you might be that that interpersonal work that you and I do might make the difference because right time. The other object.

283
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:16.380
Samantha Scott: Right. Right. And it's impossible for me, just as a creature that is oriented, the way I am to interact with myself in the same way.

284
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's this is one approach, you could you could come at it from from another approach, but I've watched this be effective and then over time. This that happens here well will happen in you and you won't need a therapist.

285
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't need any

286
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.750
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, that's cool. I mean, I'm not there yet.

287
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.140
Samantha Scott: But I'm excited for that to possibly be a say that I am

288
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So beautiful. So

289
00:28:50.550 --> 00:29:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting to learn just in this sort of organic conversation this this dialogue kind of getting to know kind of words, you already know I'm getting, you know, kind of your beliefs. I already know a little political perspective, right.

290
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To know you know some bigger things that

291
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That will will really inform where we go. So let's let's tether back. Let's turn it back to your goal.

292
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm

293
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.760
Samantha Scott: The author

294
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.240
Samantha Scott: The, the one about being present.

295
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.530
Samantha Scott: Right.

296
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what you what I have written is I want more healthy coping skills.

297
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we'll see to interact with an imperfect world. Can we talk about the second part of that for a second ability to interact

298
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And our imperfect world. And that's that political conversation. So there it is, right, it's, it is very imperfect. It's selfish, it's it's narcissistic it's greedy, it's self serving and it can be on empathetic.

299
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.150
Samantha Scott: Yes, absolutely.

300
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And there we are again to our original conversation. It's you interacting with this world and this world interacting with you. And so there we are, again, but there it is.

301
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So how am I hearing you say you want to maintain this authentic self with this world.

302
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.540
Samantha Scott: Yes. Okay.

303
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.980
Samantha Scott: That's really important because we're going to be here. Like, it's not

304
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:39.870
Samantha Scott: You know, hopefully, right, and it's not going to change and and I feel like one of the things I've tried to do in the past is like overly mystify and like over plan and stuff like that. And I want to

305
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:58.680
Samantha Scott: I do feel like that's important. Like, I want to bring up my authentic self. I want to bring empathy. I want to bring all these things to my interaction with the world, and whoever I interact with, but I it's hard because

306
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.930
Samantha Scott: Of all this personal stuff, you know, and so

307
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me say back to you a little bit of what you said.

308
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:27.510
Samantha Scott: Okay, yeah, I can see I don't even have an idea like I'm like I said it. This is a really interesting experience for me because I am I'm trying to be like totally authentic not plan out what I'm going to say, and is not comfortable, but it is important.

309
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you uncomfortable right now.

310
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.500
Samantha Scott: No, I mean I'm just, I'm just

311
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:40.680
Samantha Scott: Trying to like know that that I generally if I don't plan. What I would say in advance. I feel uncomfortable saying

312
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's take a deep breath together. Let's do belly breath Breathing in and have that belly expand that air going deep into the alarm.

313
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: An exhale out.

314
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it was also. Okay.

315
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are uncomfortable with your therapist. What if it was okay.

316
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.730
Samantha Scott: It is okay.

317
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.340
Samantha Scott: Alright.

318
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune in

319
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know.

320
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Tune into you.

321
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And see, let's label how you are actually what emotion.

322
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You would label how you're feeling

323
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what label, do you give now.

324
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopeful yeah

325
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.060
Yeah.

326
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not uncomfortable.

327
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.060
No.

328
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.150
Samantha Scott: Honestly, right now, I do not feel uncomfortable.

329
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.840
Samantha Scott: Talking about feeling uncomfortable, but I do not like

330
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so here's I'm going to reflect back a little bit of when I heard you say, and I love words, by the way, so I'll think playing with words, a lot, a lot, a lot of

331
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.580
Yeah.

332
00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Yes. With your, your, sort of that that profession, you're in

333
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have some fun with it. But it might, it also might be uncomfortable because you have a meaning that you have accumulated over time, those words have meaning that I wasn't present for when we

334
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Learned them.

335
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have those memories I have my own. So all have one thing that I grabbed over time it will have these little things attached to them. And so we'll, we'll bump into some that we don't have shared meaning and will overcome them, and we'll, we'll learn

336
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I heard was

337
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Your adaptations have been to people, please, aka empathy that has an adaptive it's gotten you friends and fun and some things

338
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And also I'm

339
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Control.

340
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:07.980
Samantha Scott: And and i know that that was there was something I was going to bring up a few minutes of a few minutes ago, the

341
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:17.280
Samantha Scott: See I'm over planning, I try so hard for me to talk like without plenty. When I say I'm

342
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.290
Samantha Scott: I'm

343
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.310
Samantha Scott: Well, I'm I

344
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can help.

345
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.880
Samantha Scott: You, yes.

346
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So for people. Right. You have this, this, you have this beautiful mind that has all these cool pieces of information.

347
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then you have choices. Well, is this the right way. Is this the right word. And how do I want to say. So there's a lot that might get in the way of the spontaneous.

348
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so my invitation to you is, and you'll hear this a lot. It'll be interviewed you'll hear it in group and you'll hear it just all kind of come at a different places.

349
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And it may seem on the front end oversimplified

350
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you don't push back at me and fight against it, you might like it isn't. It's a simple little technique and yes

351
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel an emotion word, and that's it.

352
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Start they're

353
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Not like this is the temptation our language will do this. We're used to saying, I feel that you will be going into a story as soon as that third word comes out of your mouth, where you're gone. Your

354
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Glory, so that third word can only be. This is where it may artificial unconstrained but there's actually freedom in this this simple structure.

355
00:35:48.300 --> 00:36:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel angry disgusted repulsed Excited, hopeful, optimistic paranoid jealous afraid, insecure exuberant you know you've got lots of fun words.

356
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if you can go there and just slowing time down to a nice slow three word beat. I feel

357
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.370
And start there for

358
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotion word

359
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.680
Samantha Scott: Anxious.

360
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so now, see if you can find a thought. Just one.

361
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm slowing it down by talking slowly on purpose. Okay.

362
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can find a thought.

363
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That follows that that feeds that so it might be this.

364
00:36:54.930 --> 00:37:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel anxious when I do to do or I feel anxious when when you need to.

365
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish that sentence.

366
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.850
Samantha Scott: Um,

367
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.530
Samantha Scott: I feel anxious when something comes out of my mouth that I haven't planned.

368
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:35.430
Samantha Scott: I feel anxious talking I feel anxious about trying to be authentic, you know, I feel anxious about

369
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.750
Samantha Scott: About about trying to engage with the world on

370
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.810
Samantha Scott: A real non analytical basis, um,

371
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.090
Samantha Scott: And I guess I I feel more

372
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.640
Samantha Scott: Anxious about

373
00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:13.260
Samantha Scott: Interacting with myself without with being like real and authentic and spontaneous because that's the one you know I mean like, I mean, I'm not like somebody who's scared to cry. I actually enjoy, you know, a good, a good cry but I

374
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:20.640
Samantha Scott: It's just, it's just this constant fight against trying to like overanalyze what I'm, what I'm saying, I'm working on it.

375
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So what was your experience and we're not going into any of the somatic stuff right now. The only thing that I've done in your in the body work is I just kind of tethered you back to the breath here and again and again.

376
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done a couple of times. But there's going to be some invitation to do quite a bit more of that. And so you're going to have a chance to get out of analysis, you'll run straight into there's nowhere to go but I just gotta, I gotta feel

377
00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's typically how I can go to imagery and there's lots of other places to go. That will give you a chance to be in

378
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That uncomfortable.

379
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like she right at the edge of this is I don't what huh. So there's going to be moments for that right now. We're still sort of staying up here. Okay, and

380
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be a place for you to

381
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stay here.

382
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the

383
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like for you to be to conform to that artificial structure that I asked you to do in here. I said, just say I feel and finish the sentence. What was that experience like for you.

384
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard. Yeah.

385
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:48.750
Samantha Scott: It definitely doesn't come naturally. Um, you know, but I'm I wanted to do it i wanna i want to be authentic, I want to push past all these weird

386
00:39:49.950 --> 00:40:07.260
Samantha Scott: Protective or whatever they are mechanisms, you know, to make sure my argument or line of thought is six lines during six jumps down the way. You know, and just be real. So

387
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you measure authenticity.

388
00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:18.750
Samantha Scott: I guess it's just going to have to be a feeling because I don't know how else to do it.

389
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check just to be

390
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:26.940
Samantha Scott: Honest, and to be like, and to be like, Am I, am I being authentic or am I still playing

391
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

392
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: When

393
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel anxious when I don't have

394
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a planned out, I feel, I feel anxious because I don't have planned out what I'm going to say was that authentic to me.

395
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.790
Samantha Scott: Yeah yeah

396
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

397
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:43.920
Samantha Scott: I think so.

398
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And that didn't take six months.

399
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:47.670
Right.

400
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.110
Samantha Scott: Right.

401
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.480
Samantha Scott: pregame and

402
00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, yeah. So

403
00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get some surprise experiences from things in there sort of simple state, I feel that seems like I could have done that. Well, why, why do I need you therapist for that nonsense. Okay, well,

404
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You want things authentic. What's more authentic than what that vessel that body, mind, which is all in the same skin out. Right, right.

405
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How much more authentic. Is it, then, what it's going through in the moment. Yeah. So what your emotion is is one way to know itself how the viscera has a stomach is doing, how the breathing is doing, how the hearts doing how the muscles are doing

406
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another way. That's the soma. So you're going to be hearing about

407
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Bits about awareness. Those there's going to be some maybe there's some messages coming from there too. And then there's the mind.

408
00:41:53.130 --> 00:42:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind that wanders, and what's the opinion of the mind that were soul is and what is the mind and who am I, am I my thinking brain Am I accountable for my actions with just my thoughts and it can go on and on and on and on.

409
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But

410
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say you identify, to the best of your ability, your emotion and you did to the best of your ability, what the thought was

411
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe had something to do with that emotion or that experience of it was an absence of of sort of this control and predictability and it brought some anxiousness that was an honest experience.

412
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:45.510
Samantha Scott: It's like cure. I feel I guess another word that goes along with it is like I feel like I know we all do, to some degree, but like I feel like I want to less cure rate my thoughts and and

413
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:54.810
Samantha Scott: who I really am in terms of especially in terms of this process. But in general, but, you know, especially in terms of this process.

414
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing it.

415
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, are you curating.

416
00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.580
Yes.

417
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's look at language. Let's have some fun with this. Notice that I was kind of giving a heads up that we do our storytelling quite a bit. Notice you said, I feel like

418
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.270
Samantha Scott: That's a story right

419
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it like for you to be a curator, even in here, which is about

420
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your growth. What is it like for you. What's the emotion as a curator.

421
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:32.670
Samantha Scott: It's scary.

422
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't it

423
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.360
Samantha Scott: Yeah, like, I mean it's

424
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.080
Samantha Scott: A while not being a curators scary.

425
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

426
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.190
Samantha Scott: But so, and I mean I guess that just plays into it because I'm like

427
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:59.460
Samantha Scott: Just so, uh, but I mean it's just going to be a process. I'm just gonna have to keep, like you said, right. You gotta show up, you feel uncomfortable and

428
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.520
Samantha Scott: You know, and just keep doing it. And I do want to do it. I want to do the work I do.

429
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.470
Samantha Scott: So,

430
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.200
Samantha Scott: We just keep going.

431
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think

432
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the worst client one's ever had. What if you have that time. Ah.

433
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.630
Samantha Scott: Do I think I would have that thought.

434
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now try that. Sometimes my audio doesn't work perfectly well.

435
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What if you thought, I'm the worst client when have you ever had. What if

436
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:38.760
Samantha Scott: That would be a horrible.

437
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I phrase it the way I did notice

438
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: As I said, it is

439
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going to be incorrect.

440
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's exactly where you need to be

441
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.840
Samantha Scott: Right.

442
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A hot mess and

443
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a very controlling person I got oodles of it. I got time measurable time framed quotes I got going on as far as control.

444
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.190
Samantha Scott: Birth

445
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And analysis. That's what you're paying me for insurances or whatever.

446
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You just got to do you

447
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You've

448
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Been you've already been doing and taking care of another object.

449
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO TUNE IN. TUNE IN. Doesn't matter what I think.

450
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Doesn't matter if I think and I threw out the worst thing that could possibly be your mind worst client ever

451
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:36.240
Right.

452
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.310
Samantha Scott: That's pretty bad.

453
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't exist like that, that that's a paradox. It doesn't exist. The

454
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:52.230
Samantha Scott: Black and white thinking like, it's like if you aspire to be my favorite

455
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't get there. You won't get what you need.

456
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.110
Yeah.

457
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.010
Samantha Scott: I promise I won't try to be

458
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it happens.

459
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:18.660
Samantha Scott: It'll happen on call. No, no, I and I am. I mean, because that's I'm a people pleaser. And like, like I was saying earlier, when you're raised in the South. I feel like it's very different from being raised. Well, maybe not. But in the American style like it's very

460
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:23.880
Samantha Scott: You make people happy. You know, and you're good. Nice, especially if you're a woman.

461
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, it's going to be different. And I have to say I probably look like and I have to overcome a lot of sort of bias. I think people have made up their

462
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.120
Samantha Scott: Bond. Yeah.

463
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That I drive a convertible. And then I was a cheerleader. And I have to overcome a lot of things.

464
00:46:46.020 --> 00:47:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've tried it the other way, cut my hair off died at Brown. I've done worn a suit. I have tried to fight this concept of transference and it doesn't matter what I look like I will be your grandfather or your father be an abusive.

465
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:13.530
Samantha Scott: You know perpetrator with this case, my mom, my mom and my dad, but like, I've already talked like a ton about my dad. I've never talked about my mom.

466
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

467
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, I gotta say you you

468
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Can come at me with whatever is coming up, but I'm trying to give some some little like bumpers, you know in a in a area. It's like

469
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bits to give you some idea of the room in which you can

470
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.810
Play an explorer.

471
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And some of those boundaries are. You don't have to take care of me.

472
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.050
Samantha Scott: Right.

473
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:49.950
You're being

474
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The good client will rob you of the work, you may need

475
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.330
Samantha Scott: Okay, I've got it right.

476
00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

477
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:15.510
Samantha Scott: You're right in it, and I have to be aware of that, because I know it's a concept. I know it's a part of my personality and I know that all that good feeling that I like sometimes associated with my mom is all

478
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:29.700
Samantha Scott: About me just like mirroring her back to herself, as she wants to be perceived so I definitely need to be cautious about I want you to like me. But if you don't, it's okay.

479
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Easier said than done.

480
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:40.320
Samantha Scott: Though it's definitely, definitely. But I'm going to, but that is the mind frame that I'm gonna that I'm going to put myself in

481
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And all I'll bring it up here and there. When I see it.

482
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:46.590
Samantha Scott: Right heavy

483
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: heavy handed, but I won't always bring it sometimes it just you're you. You're going to have to feel the self betrayal. I will be out of it. You'll have to be like what just wasted frickin our

484
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know,

485
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.300
Samantha Scott: That'll be on your right

486
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. So this stuff is subtle, it's your only job is to do you

487
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Change.

488
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: From this second to this moment. Now this is emerging. Now this is coming up. Now this I'm irritated with you when I don't want to talk

489
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just want to run out of here. I'm calling out of my skin. Well, I'm excited. Oh, I feel so smart. I'm smarter than you. I don't care what it is.

490
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't write I care about you not i'm not hung up on an expectation. I have about it, but my guess is based on just the little bits that you've given me these these these spaces that that you you kind of set yourself up for I'm going to just be intelligent again and I'm going to

491
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just do what I always did.

492
00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Adaptation and

493
00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody is to say we're not going to lose that you're not going to lose your ability to connect with people.

494
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because

495
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You get irritated in here.

496
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

497
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to lose this i'm not going anywhere.

498
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.360
Samantha Scott: Right, okay.

499
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.350
Samantha Scott: Knowing

500
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:22.500
Samantha Scott: Definitely knowing something is different than feeling it, but I know that

501
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.000
Samantha Scott: So,

502
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll know it when when you probably get offended.

503
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:41.310
Samantha Scott: Right. Well, I mean, the thing is, like, I feel like I mean obviously I'm not super experienced but like I feel like the nature of this relationship.

504
00:50:43.650 --> 00:51:08.100
Samantha Scott: I mean in terms of I feel like this is the right fit for me because I am I have to. I'm doing this thing of being authentic and being present and you are going to be here for me to help me and to facilitate it and I am going to work. I am going to make it a sincere effort to

505
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.070
Samantha Scott: To not please you.

506
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.050
Samantha Scott: Mean

507
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:16.770
Samantha Scott: You know anyway.

508
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I do be my worst

509
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.740
Samantha Scott: Yes, I

510
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:20.280
Try

511
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.160
Samantha Scott: I will try to not please you, unless

512
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.820
Samantha Scott: Simply who I am. Does

513
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be an interesting navigation, but that invitation is there and when you bump into it. And if you have to go to your journal. First, if it's like, Okay, I'll just, I'll just write this stuff down. Let me see it on paper. First, you know, and it gets some distance from it.

514
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

515
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the direction in general that I think I'd like to go and I will get your consent along the way.

516
00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

517
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The next time we meet

518
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'd like to teach. I teach everyone I typically even in the first session. I didn't today. I really just kind of wanted to wander around and see kind of where your mindset was, I'd like to teach formally

519
00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: My version of the building breathing box breathing the die for matic breathing. I want to teach it sort of my version of it kind of watch you do it with me. Yeah.

520
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:37.890
Samantha Scott: I have a real that's going to, I mean in terms of, like, can I take a breath. Yes, I can take a breath, but like in terms of

521
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:49.770
Samantha Scott: It. I think it all has to do, it's all tied in with that like authentic presence thing and control and curation and what we've

522
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so might my guess is so the plan right now will probably be to do that, depending on what comes up for you the next time we meet

523
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so that is a coping skill.

524
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's so much more than that.

525
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can go into as much theory as much of the poly bagel theory as you want.

526
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We can take it could take the whole session like that's like taking a breath.

527
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is that important.

528
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:30.720
Samantha Scott: It's definitely something that I'm interested in. I have a little bit of knowledge about it but not very much compared to

529
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll just, I'll say that. And then so, because again, I'll be doing that. Take a peek at kind of how that's received how it's practiced and then we'll, we'll kind of go from there.

530
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: When you want to meet again.

531
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:57.180
Samantha Scott: Well, this, this time was I'm generally a lot better in the in the later in the day, but it depends on what your schedule, what you have

532
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't see why her health plans. I'm

533
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: An afternoon. Yeah.

534
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:08.400
Samantha Scott: Okay, so what would be a late time for you or it's a convenient time

535
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking, I'm a old school.

536
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:22.020
Samantha Scott: Like even like in terms of like 10 or 11 is better than eight or nine

537
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And your group one more time.

538
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.620
Samantha Scott: It is Tuesday at noon.

539
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:32.760
Oh,

540
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.720
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that was a really good group.

541
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that was fun.

542
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's I'm going to kind of tell you how I anticipate this going

543
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.150
Samantha Scott: Okay.

544
00:54:51.330 --> 00:55:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it'll be a transition period where we may have net one week or two, where we're kind of still clunking around trying to get a spot that works well for you because I'm booked. But once you get it. I start protecting that time.

545
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah. So there's these next couple weeks might still be a little inconvenient as I

546
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: As I work out some consistency for you.

547
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.290
Samantha Scott: It's all good. I am in it.

548
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

549
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I will say,

550
