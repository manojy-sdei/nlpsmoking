12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.290

Michelle: No, no.

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.240
Michelle: It's been a pretty quiet week we kind of just

18
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
Michelle: Been watching the news a lot and just kind of like a little bit of shock and I guess you could say.

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

20
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.000
Michelle: You know,

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be careful where you get your information from like you want to get your information from like the CDC website or you know what I mean. Cuz you can hear so much stuff you know that

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can just cause anxiety and stress to go through the roof. You know,

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm. Definitely. So I always just go check the CDC website because I know it's facts. I know it's true. I know it's not like doctored up in any way and you know they update their information daily so

24
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.130
Michelle: Kind of just watch a lot of the Fox News.

25
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any word from your dad.

26
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.500
Michelle: I talked to him.

27
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.710
Michelle: yesterday and the day before.

28
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.740
Michelle: Yesterday,

29
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:31.890
Michelle: But that's according to him, everything's still planned up here to got the storage unit. It's already been purchase he's supposed to come by. Not this Friday with the following Friday and we're supposed to load a U Haul truck.

30
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.900
Michelle: And

31
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.140
Michelle: He told me for right now all the coronavirus is going to going on. And just in case they do it like a state lockdown or a city lockdown or whatnot.

32
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.780
Michelle: We may be able to stay at my grandmother sounds. If it gets to that point.

33
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.790
In because

34
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.700
Michelle: I don't know.

35
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.620
Michelle: Pretty scary to be I've heard actually that they've closed down a lot of the camping sites, you know,

36
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
Michelle: Because of what's going on. So I don't even know you'd be able to find again it's not

37
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

38
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.780
Yeah.

39
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't know that.

40
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.320
Yeah.

41
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.260
Michelle: But I would they would keep them open. You know, Kim campgrounds or campgrounds people are

42
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fresh air,

43
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.660
Yeah.

44
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.240
Michelle: But, you know,

45
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:47.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It. Regardless, it's still if if that happens, it still works out in your favor because then you don't have the stress of having this data campground. But then you're able to stay at your grandma's you know and have a roof over your head so

46
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:59.940
Michelle: And I just trying to get this little driver's license things situated and figured out and I'm having a hard time doing that. So I don't and that's scary, too, because if I don't get my driver's license. I don't

47
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.620
Michelle: Think he's going to give you the band, you know, because it's still unsure under his name still registered in his name.

48
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

49
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.080
With

50
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything you know it was closing and no one's in the office and you know all of this stuff. Definitely. It's going to be more of a struggle to be able to

51
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, get that handled and I'm not saying that's a, that's a good thing. But I'm saying, in a sense, it might have worked out in your favor. Only because there's the that it's out of your control.

52
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And he knows that you know if nobody's in the office. You can't, you know, do anything if you don't you the underlined is if you don't have the money to to handle it right now. Anyways,

53
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost like a breath that it's kind of working in your favor a little bit

54
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.930
Michelle: Yeah.

55
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, one way to look at it.

56
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.330
Michelle: Yeah.

57
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.900
Michelle: That's just my family's really really weird. It's hard to explain, really, I just like they just put my great grandmother in

58
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.210
Michelle: In an old folks home where I used to work.

59
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.750
Michelle: Me in

60
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:27.090
Michelle: Her house is vacant right now. And I guess she's my great grandmother her daughter Megan mama.

61
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.780
Michelle: Yes, um, they put her in a home and I guess they're already box in her house up

62
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.820
Michelle: And I'm like, oh, I

63
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:45.270
Michelle: Couldn't help take care of her, or, you know, while the form down. Why can't we, you know, live there for a little bit so we can you know

64
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See

65
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I love that I'm

66
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.310
Michelle: Talking on the phone.

67
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She said, This is my time doing it.

68
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:36.060
Michelle: So that kind of irritated me you know a little bit like it's not like she doesn't have the room. There were like we could stay there and I could you know look after her because her Alzheimer's was

69
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.190
Michelle: You just arrived home.

70
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And even with putting her in a home, they still won't let you stay at her house.

71
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.090
Michelle: No, my dad said that cherries box and stuff up so that they can get it on the market to sell it.

72
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.100
Like well

73
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With the economy and with, you know, all of this going on. It's going to be a while.

74
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.450
Michelle: It's like I said

75
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.050
Michelle: I mean,

76
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.720
Michelle: And it's

77
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.890
Michelle: Pretty messed up situation. I feel like, you know,

78
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.490
Michelle: Because when my grandmother went over the, you know, when she lost her mind there for a little while.

79
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.840
Michelle: We were living you know we weren't living there, but I was commuting back and forth. They were letting me drive her car.

80
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:39.450
Michelle: Back and forth because I lived here in Crescent City, you know, and then Brookings so let me drive her car and I was, you know, it was basically like a job, you know, take care of all Naik on home at night.

81
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.550
Michelle: But

82
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:49.440
Michelle: I just thought it super weird. You know, like, that's, that's my area of expertise. You know, if you will.

83
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

84
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.270
Michelle: To say, but I don't know.

85
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well maybe when you get up there. You can go visitor. You know what I mean and see

86
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean how how bad she is. You know what I mean and get some comfort.

87
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

88
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.250
Michelle: Not even asking

89
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:20.640
Michelle: You know, it's, it's not about, you know, because I thought about flying there. They used to work there. I thought about, you know, asking, Jerry. If

90
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:30.330
Michelle: You know, if I'm working at CBL, you know, I would be down there, you know, could be state you know grandma's house. I just don't see it happening.

91
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:37.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your dad said no because they're already packing it up, but you are going to ask Dr. You're trying to talk to her, and

92
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.120
Michelle: Mm hmm. Yeah. Her and there's there's

93
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.260
Michelle: My grandma, my aunt sherry and Darlene.

94
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.740
Michelle: And Uncle Bob. There's four four kids and of all, you know, and

95
00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:03.510
Michelle: My grandmother, my father's mother removed herself from the world because she didn't feel like she she needed any of it you know she's set for life.

96
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.020
Michelle: As far as like financially and that kind of like, you know, and then so she left it up to

97
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:23.490
Michelle: Darlene removed herself, because she's set financially for the rest of her life and didn't, you know, and sherry and Bob are the ones that would needed or whatever, you know, sure he's got kids and grandkids and bobs

98
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.040
Michelle: Bob

99
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need you're gonna say that.

100
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:43.590
Michelle: And Bob actually lives in an RV on grandmother great grandmother property next right next to the house. So before they put her in the home. He was there, like, you know, to take care of, like, not

101
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.540
Michelle: Hearing her but

102
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:56.520
Michelle: Just there on the property like she was taking care of herself. She was showering and doing everything yourself. He was just kind of there to just be there and you know

103
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.380
Michelle: Yeah, before her.

104
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.680
Michelle: Alzheimers started progressing.

105
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.090
Michelle: But

106
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:16.710
Michelle: So Sherry and Bob don't get along and they're fighting over who gets what, all I mean they've been fighting over who gets what for less five years since great grandma has health is

107
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.260
Michelle: You know she's getting older and her health is going down.

108
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:32.130
Michelle: So I probably for the bull. I mean, I don't think they would both be able to come to agree sherry probably would want to help, whereas Bob's like I want that money. Yeah.

109
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.180
Yeah.

110
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.590
But

111
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they're putting your house up on the market before

112
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What if, what if we find it here in the next month or so of Alzheimer's and she she's looking at home to go do

113
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, but

114
00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:04.830
Michelle: Yeah, no, I agree I it's not like grandma's dead yet. You know, I know. I completely agree. And I think it's really messed up. I, I don't understand it myself, but I don't know. Maybe she has it in her mind grandma's gonna pass away.

115
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:13.920
Michelle: Because she's apparently she's been like destroying the room, destroying and breaking stuff just really mean, nasty and angry.

116
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.540
Michelle: And

117
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.590
Michelle: Apparently she's not doing too good. She

118
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:40.530
Michelle: escaped the first home. She was in a wheelchair lost control going down the hill and bashed her face in the back of a car and they wouldn't operate on her I is that she didn't. They didn't think she would make it through so i don't i don't know what kind of state of mind. She's in now.

119
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.480
Michelle: Yeah, you know,

120
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.160
Michelle: But

121
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.800
Michelle: Prior to that, she was just kind of

122
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.450
Michelle: Repeating stuff like

123
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:55.350
Michelle: Kind of like more. So like in the late evenings, like when they when their son downing you know like

124
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.190
Michelle: She would just kind of be like, oh, I need to go see the doctor.

125
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:09.960
Michelle: She would call my grandma like over and over again. I need to go see the doctor. And it would just be the same repetitive you've already seen the doctor you saw the doctor. Two days ago. You're supposed to rest and stay home and

126
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:22.770
Michelle: Take it easy. And, um, no, but I need to go. I need to see the doctor, you know. And then, okay, we'll take you to the doctor, just to kind of appeaser and like loving drop it and try to move on from something to something else and

127
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.070
Michelle: She would just call back again. I need to go see the doctor and

128
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.630
Michelle: That's when

129
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.690
Michelle: I guess stuff really crazy in

130
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:39.510
Michelle: Which is weird, because when she was in the rehab facility after she had surgery on her hip. She was barely normal

131
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.390
Michelle: And then when she got home, it's like

132
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.240
Michelle: I don't know.

133
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, just got worse.

134
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.870
Michelle: Yeah. Within a matter of like two months, a month.

135
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.910
Michelle: Which is bizarre to me.

136
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:54.900
Yeah.

137
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.800
Michelle: Yeah.

138
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is crazy.

139
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.660
Crazy because

140
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.360
Michelle: They wouldn't have released her from the rehab facility you know if she

141
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.940
Michelle: Lupin

142
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:12.960
Michelle: Yeah.

143
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.950
You know,

144
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:15.900
Michelle: But

145
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would think

146
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:27.990
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. Well, they're not just a rehab facility you know there there's different sections you know the end the rehab the the assisted living and then the

147
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.720
Michelle: Dependent living you know we're

148
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alzheimer's in it.

149
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.070
Michelle: Yeah yeah

150
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, so things have been mellow this week and good and you guys are keeping to yourself and just

151
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.240
Michelle: Oh, yeah, yeah. We haven't really gone anywhere you know

152
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:55.920
Michelle: I'm scared. You know, I look at a lot of stuff, you know, but then you know the stuff has been spreading around since December and you can have it and not sure it's

153
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:12.960
Michelle: Not scary in itself. And it's not just the elderly, it's anybody any. It doesn't matter whether you have underlying. I mean, it makes it worse if you have underlying you know conditions or low immunity or whatever. But it doesn't matter.

154
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:13.710
Yeah.

155
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.140
Michelle: Yeah.

156
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:31.710
Michelle: I'm not scared of getting it necessarily I'm more scared of you know how as it progresses, as it gets worse. How the public's going to react and how the people and how that's handled because there's a lot of Trump haters out there and there's a lot of

157
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.410
Michelle: Weird crazy

158
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:36.840
Michelle: You know,

159
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:43.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yeah yeah people react. You know, when things like this happen and people react in ways that

160
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are just amazing.

161
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's, it's quite

162
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.460
You know, it's

163
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.780
Michelle: Yeah.

164
00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:01.380
Michelle: No, I, you know, I'm not. I don't you know as much as I have, you know,

165
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.210
Michelle: You know, because they say you can't have faith and have fear that just doesn't work.

166
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.030
Michelle: But

167
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.640
Michelle: As much as I have fear, I do have

168
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.410
Michelle: You know, Steve, I have I have what little faith, I

169
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.340
Michelle: It's, it's hard. You know, but I do believe that, you know, we are going to a better place. And, or at least

170
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.350
Yeah.

171
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.460
Michelle: Saying it. I do believe that I've got, I've got to believe that

172
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Jesus, I think that

173
00:15:46.800 --> 00:16:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Having a healthy, healthy dose of fear. There's nothing wrong with that. And you can be, you know, have faith and have that healthy dose of fear. It's when you're so crippled with that fear that that's all you get stuck in you know where it's unhealthy. So you can have both.

174
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

175
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.590
Michelle: Right.

176
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm afraid of people's reaction overall

177
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I have faith that

178
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, whatever's gonna be there's something else in control.

179
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:23.250
Michelle: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, you know, in the long term, long, you know, everything will be all right.

180
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.440
Michelle: You know, but

181
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.190
Michelle: It's definitely going to be, you know, it's rough, it's gonna be hard. You know, I don't know.

182
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.980
Michelle: The people. A lot of people are still in kind of like the denial phase, you know, like

183
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.540
Michelle: You know, you know. Yeah. This is America but

184
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:59.100
Michelle: America has its limits to, you know, like I feel like as far as Italy goes you know we're, we're just a matter of weeks away what you know i mean it.

185
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.380
Michelle: When you have

186
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:14.070
Michelle: People who don't show sometimes and they're spreading it around, you know, but even then it takes, like, what, three to 10 days before you can maybe possibly even start to show symptoms.

187
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I two weeks, like that.

188
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.580
Michelle: Something like that, yeah.

189
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:22.080
Michelle: Yeah. So that whole time period, you're still spreading it around.

190
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.970
Michelle: You know, unknowingly, you know, unbeknownst to you, but

191
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.720
Michelle: I i'm I'm

192
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:43.860
Michelle: You know and like I said, the stuff that realistically has been spreading since December. I mean, because people have been flying back and forth, since it was up until the last month at least

193
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, couple

194
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.290
Michelle: Few weeks people been flying back and forth all over the world.

195
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.080
Michelle: Yep, it's scary to think about it and

196
00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is scary, but it may be you know it. There's also a piece of it changes always scary.

197
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but

198
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think, you know, and this is again my opinion, in my perspective of it is that maybe it's a reset that society needs a little bit right and you know there's always going to be those people that

199
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: underplay it that don't think you could happen to them until it does

200
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like all the Spring Breakers over in Florida that are just still partying up, Keith.

201
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I thought that was kind of ironic. They're like, Oh, no, you're not messing up my spring break, you're

202
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:52.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: like whoa, dude. But you know what I mean, it's going to the great part about it is that we don't have control over what's going to happen in society itself, you know, out through this whole thing, but

203
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm hoping that they find a cure for the flu.

204
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through this whole process.

205
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:07.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of being a year behind with flu shots that don't work. The next year. You know what I mean.

206
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we've we've just been consistently behind you know the strands

207
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:25.560
Michelle: Since 2011 when I was pregnant with my son and I had no clue. I got the flu. There was like a 24 hour FLU BUG. When I was pregnant with him.

208
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.080
Michelle: Uh huh. And that was the last time about this live and I've never had a flu shot. Since he

209
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was kind of

210
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crazy, huh.

211
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.380
Yeah.

212
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I haven't had him for quite a few years, either. And I haven't gotten sick, either.

213
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:51.540
Michelle: I mean I've gotten sick like just not too. Not too long ago. Just recently I mean I had that it was a chest. It was a chest cold, then you know sinus cold in it, but

214
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.870
Michelle: I didn't have no like aches and pains.

215
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.330
Michelle: Nothing like that it was

216
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Rest of it.

217
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.270
Michelle: Just sinus you know

218
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:08.160
Michelle: But it was, it was pretty rough i right, got it, too. And she she had a really bad sore throat.

219
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.980
Michelle: Mine started out like it was it felt like it was gonna hurt really really bad, but you

220
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.210
Michelle: Know the ibuprofen did its job, or whatever. But I didn't feel like my throat hurt that bad, you know,

221
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

222
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.210
Michelle: It didn't at least

223
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.450
Michelle: Didn't progress.

224
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's because you have a strong immune system to, you know, you think about that.

225
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:44.970
Michelle: I don't think my immune system is too strong know and I know my lungs are terrible because I'm, I'm a heavy smoker. My lungs are terrible. I mean, I'm constantly coughing up nasty.

226
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cough cough it up a nasty.

227
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.090
Michelle: I need to cut back I really really do.

228
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.740
Michelle: It's just

229
00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:01.140
Michelle: It's kind of like a anxiety kind of thing to it's, it's, I had

230
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:10.350
Michelle: I feel like I have OCD as well just certain like I don't know if you want to call it like rituals, if you will.

231
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:21.330
Michelle: But like certain things when I do certain things I do them a certain way with certain, you know, it's kind of hard to explain. I guess that's kind of a form of OCD issue.

232
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me know

233
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:35.220
Michelle: But I do. I feel like I do. And because of my anxiety. I mean, it's like biting my nails. I can't even tell you how many times throughout my life. Stop writing notes, you know,

234
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. Yeah.

235
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:42.000
Michelle: Long time I've ever not been able to bake bite my nails is when I have like the fake acrylic nails on

236
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.200
Michelle: A second there off anything that's grown is gone.

237
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:56.130
Michelle: I mean I literally all my life. I mean, my dad when I was younger, you know, statement got sauce catch it and

238
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.200
Michelle: Nothing ever worked

239
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nothing worked for work.

240
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.950
Michelle: The nail polish stuff, you know,

241
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:14.610
Michelle: Nick bite or whatever it's called. Nothing ever worked and it's not something like, I like to do or want to do. I hate it. I hate my nails looking like they're just

242
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:22.950
Michelle: knobs and dry. It's something that's, you know, self conscious, you know, I'm super self conscious about

243
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:30.270
Michelle: It, but I just like, like, it's like a nervous habit. It's an anxiety thing or something like say

244
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.950
Michelle: I performing anxiety anxiety or whatever anxiety.

245
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.900
Michelle: Now one of the symptoms of high functioning anxiety or something like that.

246
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There it is.

247
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.160
Yeah.

248
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There it is.

249
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.190
There's literally

250
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like a soothing it you know when you develop it throughout your life. It's like a

251
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:17.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like a soothing almost like a soothing technique in reality you know doesn't really do the job well it must if you keep doing it. It's, you know, there's, it's super something, you know what I mean. And it's a learned behavior to and learn behaviors are in, you know, they're hard to

252
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.110
Michelle: You know, it's funny.

253
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:31.260
Michelle: Because apparently my mother was a nail biter. I don't remember it or ever seen her biting her nails, but apparently she was a nail biter she quit, but

254
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:42.210
Michelle: My daughter, I've noticed a riot, she's constantly at least got the one finger in your mouth like and I'm trying to like break that habit. Every time I see appears in a mouth. I'm like,

255
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:49.260
Michelle: You know cuz I don't want her to grow up biting their nails like I am, because as far back as I can remember, like,

256
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:56.430
Michelle: Four or five years old as far back as I can remember, I've always been

257
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:58.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Been you now.

258
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well you another piece of it is not putting them you know you being conscious about not doing it in front of her to

259
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:09.600
Michelle: Right.

260
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:17.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the tough part because, you know, you think about it, it's like you don't even have to have a thought when you're used to doing it. Your whole life.

261
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right before you're doing it right.

262
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just about being conscious, you know, and aware when she's around yeah you know that

263
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She doesn't see you do it too, you know.

264
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's that's the tough stuff right there.

265
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Yeah, I feel really bad, too, because like you say it's learned behavior monkey.

266
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.190
Michelle: See monkey. Do you know my grandma when I was younger.

267
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:58.320
Michelle: And I think it was like 1213 my grandma said the same thing about smoking cigarettes to my uncle. What about his kids because broken Chris both smoke cigarettes.

268
00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.370
Michelle: And they knew

269
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.270
Michelle: They didn't work. So they were home all day, both, you know, the kids and

270
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.530
Michelle: More likely, you know, grow to be smokers to, you know,

271
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:21.480
Michelle: My dad didn't smoke when I was growing up, he does now. But my mom always my mom, my grandmother's smoke like

272
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.020
Michelle: I mean,

273
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.530
Michelle: As far back as I can remember, I've always

274
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:29.910
Known

275
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.690
Michelle: That I didn't start smoking cigarettes till I was late.

276
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:40.530
Michelle: Maybe 1516 and then I stopped and didn't start

277
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:49.500
Michelle: Till I was about 18 and then I stopped again and I didn't pick it back up close like 23 and I've smoked it since.

278
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ever since yeah yeah i think that you know it's a there's a piece of it. There's a cool factor in the beginning.

279
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And then I believe that

280
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once you are in the habit of doing it on a regular basis, you're, you know, you're mentally and physically addicted to it, it takes like three days to get

281
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:24.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before your nicotine free for them to continue to come out of your system. But then you've got everything else, like the cravings and all of that other stuff, just like you do, you know, a lot of other addictions.

282
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you still have to change that mindset. And I also believe that smoking is one of the hardest things

283
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To stop. Yeah.

284
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know definitely and. Is it doable. Yeah. But when you're in a time of stress or you know what I mean, yeah, chaos or unsure D. It's like, who wants to stop it feels like it's a

285
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: An anxiety reducer. You know what I mean.

286
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.910
Michelle: Yeah, yeah, these five minutes.

287
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say

288
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At least that's what it tells your mind right

289
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm stressed, I need to go smoke.

290
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.920
Michelle: But

291
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in reality, it's a it's got a stimulant in it. So it's we think that a it helps with anxiety. You know what I mean. But in reality, it has that underlying current that happens to you, kind of amazing because a lot of substances are like that, you know,

292
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I think that when you're ready to quit. You'll quit.

293
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

294
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.980
Michelle: And definitely going to be quitting here in the next couple of years, for sure, at least at least

295
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:49.230
Michelle: Probably end sooner probably sooner, you know, because I I do at least need to like cut back. The problem is we roll our own buy packs of cigarettes. I can

296
00:27:50.310 --> 00:28:11.760
Michelle: So I buy a big bag of tobacco or two and it usually last me quite a long time. Like even let me because I am kind of a chain smoker and I do, I do smoke a lot and we go through more papers than we do tobacco and the papers that we buy the Bueller's there's like 152 in one package.

297
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.670
Michelle: Not all last us the two of us.

298
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.230
Michelle: As we both smoke. The last maybe two, three days.

299
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.930
Michelle: In the papers.

300
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.860
Michelle: So that's part of the problem, too, is we're not like oh dwindling down, looking at the box, you know,

301
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I only got three left, you know, or

302
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.300
Yeah.

303
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:43.260
Michelle: I mean, I said, I'm like, it doesn't. I don't have that, like in my brain, like, oh, I've only got like this much left I should wait a little bit longer, or

304
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.960
Michelle: Yeah, always, you know, or what I don't

305
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.270
Michelle: I don't have that, you know, so that, yeah, maybe I should buy smaller bands.

306
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crazy when you go to Oregon, you know, there's no taxes and things are cheaper.

307
00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

308
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in Oregon, for sure. Yeah, for sure.

309
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.410
Michelle: Most definitely.

310
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.270
Definitely

311
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

312
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's, you know, you've got to like consciously. When you're ready, you'll know. You know what I mean.

313
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But until then, I wouldn't give it a second thought I would just especially right now, you know, with everything that's getting ready to happen you're getting ready to move

314
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Going into the unknown. You got all these things happening. You know what I mean. And you're sober and you're doing all this other stuff.

315
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know. Yeah.

316
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.010
Michelle: One thing at a time. Right.

317
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One day, right. One thing I did actually you're doing like two or three things at once. So, you know,

318
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't add more to that plate right now.

319
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.670
Michelle: No, I was

320
00:29:52.140 --> 00:30:03.450
Michelle: Just feel bad because sometimes like she's she'll come in, you know, and I try not to smoke around or, you know, and she'll want to hug Sheila you picked up and I'm like, you know, sorry mom smoking.

321
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.590
Michelle: Sees most fun you know soon as well done, and sometimes she just doesn't

322
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.070
Fit.

323
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.740
Michelle: Really well.

324
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just give me a minute just

325
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One minute, you

326
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, I know that one. I got to there definitely

327
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what are your, what are your plans for this week.

328
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:37.110
Michelle: This week I have a lot of I have a lot still to finish, I have a lot still to finish, but I have to finish it by my

329
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:50.040
Michelle: Have to finish it. It has a choice. You can't procrastinate or meandering do my own thing any longer. I need to get it done.

330
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.450
Need to get it done.

331
00:30:52.950 --> 00:31:04.860
Michelle: I need to. I need to get my driver's license handled. I need to figure out how to because I call their zone and I left messages on three different people's messages and answering machines and I have not received a phone call back

332
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.290
Michelle: Like, I need to know

333
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.460
Michelle: Where to send what and

334
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.680
Michelle: Is it easier now, it probably wouldn't be

335
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:25.710
Michelle: Because I would still know I'm gonna have to get Norton drivers, because I don't think they'll just be like, Okay, here's the fine.

336
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:33.930
Michelle: Pay it your driver's licenses bat because I'm pretty sure they would have to take a new picture.

337
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.190
Michelle: Just kind of

338
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.240

340
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just remember though if if they're closed because of this whole virus thing, then it's out of your control. And you can only do what you can do. You know what I mean. And

341
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:58.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just remember that a lot of places are close a lot of county buildings are close, you know,

342
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. You know, so

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was not updated.

354
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:56.370

Michelle: I as far as like, I mean, for right now because of like like everything's all crazy with the virus and everything. I was just me. My California insurance and I wasn't going to switch it over to Oregon just yet because it's

358
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:42.420
Michelle: A because, for me, it's an income that I know I'm getting monthly for right now and i don't i'm just it worries me like you know the buildings are closed down or you know if the mail ends up stopping for a little while to or what you know that

359
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.180
Michelle: I'd rather just for right now at least

360
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.530
