00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.240

Should I cancel February 27 at 7am individual therapy.

3
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.530
JESSICA G: Sorry about that.

4
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.380
JESSICA G: I think I'm getting sick.

5
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really,

6
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:10.650
JESSICA G: Yeah, I'm getting sick. And then I had like a lot of phlegm in my chest and it was coming on.

7
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sounds like you got something like a cold is it just the congestion and a sore throat.

8
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.280
JESSICA G: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

9
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.650
Yeah.

10
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, and there is a sore throat or there's not

11
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.150
JESSICA G: Yeah, there's a sore throat. Yeah.

12
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are hanging out with little kids that you don't normally hang out with. Right.

13
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.620
JESSICA G: Mm hmm. Those little

14
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Bug carriers.

15
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Are cute, but they're all incubators

16
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.220
JESSICA G: Especially those kids.

17
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.670
JESSICA G: Run around a lot.

18
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've been taking the six milligram that's I'm not making you anything in particular that's not contributing to the tired feeling

19
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.250
JESSICA G: No one actually last night, I took a

20
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.230
JESSICA G: What is it called

21
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Quantity.

22
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Quantity a whole tablet.

23
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.130
JESSICA G: No, just

24
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:54.060
JESSICA G: Just to have because I'm not a medication. I was had been having a hard time at the pharmacy, like the day when I called you guys like yeah I'm one of the pharmacy tests. He was like trying to make it impossible for me to get thing medication because I went like at night.

25
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.030
JESSICA G: Because I was already out and I told them.

26
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:05.130
JESSICA G: You know who's like, I spoke to you over the phone. And then he was like, I thought I told you to come tomorrow.

27
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.250
JESSICA G: Just have to go pharmacist, the

28
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:24.660
JESSICA G: Pharmacist or something like that. No, it's like, well, yeah, I know. I'm sorry. What time is the pharmacist given. And he was like, We're open 24 hours. And I was like, okay, but what's happened is a person like he's like there's there's one here. There's always one on on

29
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:45.570
JESSICA G: On the floor and then I'll say, Well, can I talk to him and he was like, Sure. So the pharmacist was like okay you know your your Medicaid is gonna deny it, but I can sell it to you which that other dude was like, I can't even sell it to you, since it's a controlled substance and

30
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: They can sell it for cash right for Direct Pay. I mean, it's expensive. But yeah, do that.

31
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:03.090
JESSICA G: Yeah, well, that guy. And then whenever he heard about that guy. He was standing there whenever he heard that that that was gonna sell it to me.

32
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:15.840
JESSICA G: He started like doing the math, like, Oh, well, it's supposed to be this merging and she's not she wasn't supposed to run out yet. And I was like, it's because the label is off, it's supposed to be.

33
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:30.000
JESSICA G: It's supposed to be six milligrams, not for and so like I was just trying to make it impossible for me and I wasn't, I was reaching him over the phone because I'm

34
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.320
JESSICA G: I called and he put me on hold and then it rang, and hung up.

35
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:43.680
JESSICA G: On. So I was like, well, you know, like this is pretty important to me. I got put on hold. Are you gonna be able to help me.

36
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So here's

37
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The thing.

38
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know about the formula. Grab that part that information is confusing. That sounds like an old order.

39
00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I wonder is, if maybe you just needed to have ignored that maybe the doctor should have canceled that and maybe you should have picked up a six instead. Is that what happened.

40
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:14.970
JESSICA G: Um, I'm not sure. I don't know what happened. I let. I let them know that you know that it's supposed to be six milligrams brings a little bit of a mixed up with the

41
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:27.870
JESSICA G: With the dose aging. Um, so I waited there for the for them to get my medication and then under said take it under your tongue. And so it was 71

42
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.500
JESSICA G: And so

43
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:33.540
Yeah.

44
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.750
JESSICA G: Okay.

45
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that seven is now i'm i'm really more lost than anything but so February 21 doctor every all rights a 60

46
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.760
milligram

47
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like she gave me 333 of the six milligrams. Right.

48
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.320
JESSICA G: Now, I was, um, I was seven of the two milligrams

49
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.640
JESSICA G: So I had to put three under my tongue.

50
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I see seven films.

51
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To milligram

52
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so they were two milligrams. So 246246

53
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So if they're two milligrams and makes sense. You wouldn't put three under there.

54
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

55
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

56
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here's my thinking regarding that regarding the pharmacist when a doctor writes an order.

57
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What a pharmacist doesn't know.

58
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is whether. Notice how we went up a dose. We went up.

59
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The pharmacy this tech doesn't know that he's acting outside of his role.

60
00:22:52.080 --> 00:23:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: He's trying to act like a treatment provider where he's doing what the doctrine. I do, is we're watching your dose to make sure you're not self medicating and things like that. He's stepping outside of his role but pharmacist doesn't do that.

61
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't do that that's not their role they stepped outside their lane.

62
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So something you might say, of course, we want to say it very politely, because these are people are going to be interacting with again. So we don't have piss them off, but you might say,

63
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it ship just does it show a new order my doctor and I are in close coordination every week. Sometimes twice a week regarding changes in my prescription that isn't something

64
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sir, you would be aware of. Right. You wouldn't be aware of that. That's between my doctor and I, is there a viable order.

65
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, I mean, you don't want to say it rude, obviously, but their job. There's a whole database to show whether your doctor shopping

66
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to another pharmacy, they're going to be able to see a doctor, Solomon, Dr. Aubrey I'll review them Dr elements great at he does it every single time he meets with the clients in group. They can see whether people are doctor shopping

67
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's a database that keeps an eye on that and Dr brielle and I kind of touch base. I left. So I kind of check in on what a dose your app, but she that's her job. She doesn't

68
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Count out the strips. That's what this tech is supposed to do. He's supposed to read the script and follow what the doctor said

69
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that help at all, not to piss him off not trying to get him in

70
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.140
JESSICA G: Trouble.

71
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.000
JESSICA G: Trying to empower you see

72
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That a doctor gets to decide, he she could decide right now. I want her at 24 milligrams and put in an order right now.

73
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: She could do that.

74
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what is this, what is this tech going to do

75
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Well, he's going to look as

76
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Old, why were you at Fort he had started for him to decide how much you have left, he can decide whether the insurance will cover it. Yes, that's in his training.

77
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That, that makes sense. But for him to decide whether you run out. That's none of his business. He went outside his lane. We were there the insurance will cover it. Yes, that's a conversation appropriate that man needs more training.

78
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he would have heard it for me. Don't you

79
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do not want to get a conversation with me.

80
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.940
JESSICA G: Yeah, well I just did. I stayed quiet because I tried. I tried talking and

81
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.050
JESSICA G: They just blew me off. So I was just like, you know what he's doing. I'm not sure to walk away. Yeah.

82
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, that was in person.

83
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.870
JESSICA G: Yeah.

84
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the pharmacist did did the pharmacist behave a little bit more professionally.

85
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So when you have ignorance with ego.

86
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a drama about to happen. This man doesn't know enough and isn't humble enough to get information. So he blocked.

87
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And made it about blah, blah, blah. That is business.

88
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not. It is business.

89
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:13.710
JESSICA G: Yeah, I figured I figured I was like okay you're sitting there counting down the days to the pharmacist, the pharmacist just looks like whoa.

90
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there was a little bit of validation, to your point.

91
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, who

92
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.530
JESSICA G: I hate when that happens, and because

93
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you guys have to keep going there, week after week after week, and I don't like to think that

94
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be you know disinterested and

95
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have compassion for the ignorant. It just doesn't know. And unfortunately, right. We don't have to point it out, but

96
00:26:48.150 --> 00:27:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just ask for the pharmacist. Hey, you and I tend to have a little confusion. Let me just talk to the pharmacist don't even start with them, then you start to say, I know. I'd rather talk to the pharmacist about my medications really importantly, don't even talk to him.

97
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be sweet and you could you have the right to do that at a pharmacy. Just ask for pharmacist.

98
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, good text will say, do you want to speak with the pharmacy about your medication. Right.

99
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.930
JESSICA G: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

100
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.220
JESSICA G: Yes.

101
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.480
JESSICA G: We have question.

102
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. And you do so you might as well just started. Yeah, I got some questions for my pharmacist and she was. See if you could get ahold of them just bring him over. You don't even have to chit chat with that other fella.

103
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm hand. So, how we doing on how you're doing emotionally. What's the dream life like kind of tell me a little bit about that.

104
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.410
JESSICA G: It's just been awesome.

105
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.790
JESSICA G: It's been I'm

106
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:02.040
JESSICA G: Like okay, except for a little while ago when I fell back asleep.

107
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:18.390
JESSICA G: And I started dreaming that I was, I was in, I was somewhere. I don't know exactly where it's been a lot of traveling dreams lately and I get stuck or I get in trouble or something.

108
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.590
JESSICA G: Um, so, so we were at like this.

109
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:40.290
JESSICA G: It was like a zoo type thing, and where you get to like in this isn't the first time I've had a dream where I'm like, in some kind of enclosure with the animals and stuff. And like two people are allowed to view them, but then all of a sudden the animal start getting out.

110
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.630
JESSICA G: The animal start getting that and I'm like finding a way to get like get away from the out animals and get you know all over

111
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.120
JESSICA G: The place and

112
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.750
JESSICA G: And it's just weird.

113
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Remind me because i i i might be

114
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean to be insensitive but I wanted to ask you something.

115
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You can just say not ready to talk about it, but that that time in in Mexico was that purely that you went there for for drug use or was there something sort of traumatic that that brought you to Mexico.

116
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:39.690
JESSICA G: Um,

117
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.040
JESSICA G: I was just riding along with

118
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.100
JESSICA G: My boyfriend at the time.

119
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:56.760
JESSICA G: And like we'd be we drive around like do illegal stuff and then take the

120
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.200
JESSICA G: Legal merchandise across the border.

121
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:03.510
JESSICA G: And

122
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:17.100
JESSICA G: Then we ended up getting stuck there and they just like a bonded us in the motel room for like four days.

123
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:24.300
JESSICA G: And it was it was me, it was us and ammonia couple, but I wanna fight with the girl.

124
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.740
JESSICA G: Yeah, I can show you what the girl like in a physical fight. And then, um,

125
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:40.110
JESSICA G: So the other guy took her to took them to his house because obviously he knew him better and

126
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.070
JESSICA G: We stayed at that Motel and

127
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:50.310
JESSICA G: Like they weren't able to get any we didn't get any

128
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.120
JESSICA G: So we had money but we didn't have drugs.

129
00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:05.250
JESSICA G: And now that area that guy who'd like right around that area didn't like that specific drug getting like that drug and he found out using

130
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:23.310
JESSICA G: You know, get rid of you. And so they had to drive to what s, which is like two hours away to go pick up. And finally, that dude that we went there with was like okay well I'm that he actually went to the motel room where we were already like and

131
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.690
JESSICA G: You already like in day for withdraw.

132
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, miserable. Good. Great.

133
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.200
JESSICA G: Thanks for withdraw.

134
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.630
JESSICA G: In a motel room in Mexico. It's so hot.

135
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.700
JESSICA G: Cold water.

136
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not fun.

137
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: On the spectrum fun that is way up there on the not fun.

138
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:56.520
Yeah.

139
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.880
JESSICA G: Okay. Okay, so let me

140
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:08.610
JESSICA G: Make it short. We ended up getting the drug day we stayed there a few more weeks and I don't know why. And then

141
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:15.090
JESSICA G: He ended up trying to cross the border and I stayed back and they took him to jail.

142
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.280
JESSICA G: Because he had a warrant. And so I stood by myself there.

143
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: In a hotel by yourself.

144
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:30.300
JESSICA G: No, no. So by the time we were already in this dude's brother's house who worked for the cartel.

145
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:31.020
Okay.

146
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it. Okay, so you're there. Hi, I'm assuming you still have a decent supply it was heroin at that point.

147
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.540
JESSICA G: Know,

148
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you doing at that point.

149
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, mercy.

150
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.620
JESSICA G: Um, so we ran out. So that's why he wanted to cross the border.

151
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.560
JESSICA G: Okay, um,

152
00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.790
JESSICA G: He was taken and

153
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:05.940
JESSICA G: Luckily, luckily, God, putting me has always put me in like the

154
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:16.890
JESSICA G: Like decent people in my, in my way. You know, and they offered me a bite to eat. They offered me, you know, a dream.

155
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.440
JESSICA G: I'm using know so it wasn't bad people.

156
00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:39.000
JESSICA G: The two guys who worked for the cartel had a big house and both to the girlfriends whether when other ladies was older and so she was doing. I was like looking out for me. And then the other younger girl. She was looking out for me to like she was cold and everything that

157
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.550
JESSICA G: They were both just really nice people. You know, I've got remote control.

158
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:58.290
JESSICA G: And so I called my mom and I was like, Mom, I'm stuck here in Mexico, and I don't have money. I don't have anything. And she was like, well, the only way you're going to be able to leave there is, if I can pick you up. Otherwise, I'm not going to help you.

159
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.810
JESSICA G: I was like, okay, that's what I kind of wanted to do anyway.

160
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.160
JESSICA G: Right. Come pick me up. Yeah. And so she went and picked me up.

161
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.890
JESSICA G: That's in Columbus, New Mexico. So we went through them in Toronto.

162
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.650
JESSICA G: And I was like, so like withdrawn, this whole time and

163
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:34.500
JESSICA G: Then we went to Albuquerque through from Roswell to Albuquerque. And there I was able to get some like

164
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.590
JESSICA G: Like I couldn't get you some some Suboxone to help me with the

165
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:53.820
JESSICA G: With the withdrawn and they wouldn't they just wouldn't let me she want my older brother and my older brother, you know, he got in his aggressive mode and

166
00:34:55.050 --> 00:35:06.570
JESSICA G: I was just like, Please, just like I'm like I'm doing really bad right now like right. I need you know I won't leave. I'll come back. I won't leave. And I guess they didn't believe me and

167
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:12.930
JESSICA G: So we just left and I just did it. I hadn't heard I try and

168
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:25.920
JESSICA G: Do tax about that Tuesday, because I know because the other day. OK, so my brother went to California. They were recording. They were driving up in the hills.

169
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:35.940
JESSICA G: They were recording his girlfriend and on one of the parts when she was recording. I could hear my mom in the background talking about that day.

170
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:48.630
JESSICA G: Like saying like, you remember when we brought Jessica all all crazy, she was acting all CRAZY. And she was crying and screaming I just told her you know Monica.

171
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:58.380
JESSICA G: I can be mad at you because it's my own fault because I did it. I did it. And it's true. And I just, I ain't hurtful. The way you are saying

172
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:07.860
JESSICA G: She got so offended. In a few days ago. She was like, I just want you to know that I'm hurt you hurt my feelings.

173
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.510
JESSICA G: hurt your feelings, because you are talking about me.

174
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah yeah so

175
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica.

176
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.490
JESSICA G: Sorry, I tried to

177
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.380
JESSICA G: Do all that

178
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You run across that term yet gaslighting

179
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.790
JESSICA G: Is that what she was doing. I've heard it before, but

180
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me tell you something. The people that if they've never really understood what it is, it can be really liberating for the client, because you finally get i'm not i'm not the crazy one

181
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This other person is doing this behavior to make it seem like to always have me off balance.

182
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be kind of a nice feeling to finally get what what someone's doing to you. Um, do you want to know more about it.

183
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.090
JESSICA G: Sure.

184
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.400
JESSICA G: Yeah.

185
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't, we don't really have time to do any of those sort of, you know,

186
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychotherapy interventions, but

187
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, what's your last girl.

188
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.160
JESSICA G: Is it is

189
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming.

190
00:37:53.670 --> 00:38:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me find it. This I have this good video. Let me, let me see if I can just find it quickly. Okay, I have it bookmarked. I just want to make sure show all type in, if not, I'm sure it's still up

191
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The nice thing about it is if it does resonate with you. I can send you a list of, like, five things to do.

192
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The completely

193
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: cuts it off like

194
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's done.

195
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you know, there was things that you can do to not get hooked anymore. I'm not saying happens overnight, but let me just make sure this right one scott brown hair. This is it.

196
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's 12 minutes long. Let me see what of that someone we may not be able to get all the way through it. She talks kind of slow. Let me just switch. I'm going to move it maybe

197
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple mess. There is confusion.

198
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything is upside down.

199
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Reality is being cancelled and nothing means anything

200
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The term gaslighting refers to when someone manipulates you

201
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: In questioning your own sanity.

202
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a term we are hearing a lot of right now.

203
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a term. I'm very familiar with.

204
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: People are perhaps confused with how to manage and to cope with the situation. And that's where I can help.

205
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was in my mid 30s.

206
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I had a meeting with my editor and it was my first major journalism assignment for the Sunday Times magazine.

207
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I gone to meet him for a drink and I was feeling hopeful. I was feeling like things might work out.

208
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: As I was leaving another writer arrived.

209
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This writer recognized me from when I was a child, and he said, Are you so and so's daughter and I replied, Yes.

210
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And he'd been against at one of my mother's dinner parties.

211
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: After I left this meeting my editor told me

212
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That he had said how I always wondered how that little girl would survive. I had thought her only chances or suicide or murder.

213
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When you told me this line. I felt validation, because here was this person who had actually witnessed what I knew to be true and it confirmed

214
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.980
What I knew

215
00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So he had said two options suicide or murder. Why would he say that and

216
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.510
JESSICA G: What does this have to do with

217
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.200
gaslighting

218
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I grew up in an environment that from the outside, seemed

219
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.730
JESSICA G: No, no, no.

220
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:03.780
No.

221
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I made sure you're falling right

222
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.370
JESSICA G: Sorry, yeah.

223
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: She grew up in a pretty middle to upper class kind of environment right

224
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.320
JESSICA G: So she's starting to tell her story.

225
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit. So you heard what this

226
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: editor said right he had this guy had seen this, this woman as a little girl in her home environment had been to, you know, a dinner party and saw this little girl. And this man says I had always wondered if that little girl.

227
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: would survive for only options. Murder. Murder right or suicide. Like, that's how miserable and crazy making

228
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Even just outside of this guest at a dinner party looking probably doesn't even know this little girl as had assessed how toxic how confusing.

229
00:41:51.300 --> 00:42:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she's telling your story. So enviable so upper middle class, whatever. My mother was a very glamorous poet and an artist, and there were always very interesting people around.

230
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The bohemian world.

231
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: She loved entertaining and there would be raucous parties on weeknights I would be in my bed trying to go to sleep, and I would be woken up with trunk and laughter noise outside the bedroom.

232
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes these people would come into my room to escape from the crowd and they would sit and they would smoke and they would use the bathroom.

233
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And other times I would get up in my nightgown and open the door and shout desperately. Please, can people be quiet. It's a school night I have to go to sleep. I have to get up tomorrow.

234
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: My mother would reply Ariel kind of during the party or she would say after the belly dancer. Everyone will go home.

235
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It was total bombardment.

236
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So the following morning what happened.

237
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To her about the situation and it was as though this disruption had never happened.

238
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What I thought had happened, I was being told had not happened right there.

239
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened.

240
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.460
JESSICA G: I was thinking did

241
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Not happen.

242
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where the child aka you

243
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Can either I either go crazy. See what my reality is being denied. That's what's happening here. Okay.

244
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

245
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If I confronted her with the facts. They were bad in a way

246
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I was sprayed with words of adoration and words of content.

247
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You're stupid idiot, and I wish you had never been born

248
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When I confronted her about having said this to me. I was told I was making it up and that it was a lot

249
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So it wasn't just that my reality was canceled, but my perceptions of reality were overwritten.

250
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality.

251
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: being denied what you have seen with your own eyes, and you know to be true being denied an experience that you have had and you know is real.

252
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, the ratio of the abuse was worse than the abuse.

253
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So it can make you crazy.

254
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are not crazy.

255
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I developed more strategies they helped me and at the time I didn't even know they were stressed, so listen closely. I'll be making

256
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: These uncertain times going to share them with you and maybe they can help you to

257
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one is to remain defiant

258
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was a little girl. I wrote a story about running away from home and when my mother saw the story. She said it wasn't true, and demanded that change it and I didn't change it. I actually yelled out, I am not changing my story I not

259
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This defiance was key because I was trusting my version of reality and not allowing it to be altered on. Yes, that's the first thing for your list of four things. The first one is remain defiant, it doesn't, it's not what it seems like as a teenager. It just means you won't

260
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't change your reality.

261
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.240
JESSICA G: For anyone

262
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how you remember it. Right.

263
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is real. This was your perception. These were your feelings. First thing remain defiant

264
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This anger protected me. I knew what I knew and it couldn't be erased.

265
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So the person gaslighting you will often try to bully you

266
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But being defiant is something that does not make you difficult it's being resilient.

267
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now recognize that you will never get accountability.

268
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: In my late 20s, I tried to confront you'll never get it.

269
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother.

270
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If this is if we're onto something in my consciousness is true. She'll never say

271
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I need to take responsibility of how I deny the reality that will never get there. She will always make it about her feelings, never about

272
00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Your feelings. She will always be redirecting it to the self. Oh, poor me. How could you. I'm so angry. They'll be no responsibility. I'm so sorry. I need to work on myself.

273
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to see a professional. I need to do some self healing some self growth really key. And this is where you know you can say to yourself.

274
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: There will be none. My mother is who she is. If this is real. If this is what's going on. She will very likely always be that way. The truth about what happened in my childhood.

275
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I was sitting with my mother in a Japanese restaurant and I said the words, child abuse, for the first time out loud.

276
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I said it playfully so she didn't feel like it was an attack on her and immediately her response was, what about mommy of us.

277
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:37.980
JESSICA G: Nobody ever talks about now.

278
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:39.690
Can you imagine

279
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.230
JESSICA G: Awful.

280
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Awful.

281
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: For little girl.

282
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

283
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have much time. As soon as

284
00:47:52.380 --> 00:48:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The robot. Let's see if we can get as far. So what I've learned in that moment was that she would never be able to take accountability for our actions, she would never get it. She would never say, Oh, you're right. You have a point

285
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And that acknowledgement was not in the cards.

286
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Asserting myself was not just useful, but it was harmful.

287
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the person gaslighting you will never be able to respond to logic or reason. And so if you notice if you assert yourself it's harmful notice you spoke up to your mom and she got pissed off, it doesn't work the regular rules for engagement don't work.

288
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Think that you can apply logic and reason you're going to feel let down

289
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: With this recognition. You are no longer powerless.

290
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go of the wish for it to be different. This is a big one for me because the wish for it to be different is very powerful inoculates you to the tumult

291
00:48:51.930 --> 00:49:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It allows you to continue to believe that logic and reason will prevail. So, and after task and this is letting go of hope, basically, that that is gaslight or will change.

292
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's distressing to the client. It's distressing to her. Maybe you the person who keeps thinking, well, maybe someday.

293
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: she'll show that she cares about me. Maybe someday, but she got a lead go particularly bad episode. My mother would reassure me that it would never happen again.

294
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It would happen again.

295
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Promises were broken. And I realized that I could not rely on her work.

296
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: With gaslighting the person gaslighting you makes you feel as though the ground is always shifting beneath your feet. Okay, so, um, my next clients here but

297
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica. I wanted to know, just at least a little bit of how you're doing as you're watching this, probably for the first time, what you're thinking about

298
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.440
JESSICA G: I know we've seen this before, haven't we

299
00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope so.

300
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.140
JESSICA G: It's a good well we have

301
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.680
JESSICA G: We have, um, but, like,

302
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:16.740
JESSICA G: I felt like dead and I didn't really know what she was talking about like that. And now that it applies to me and now it's like a completely different story. It's just

303
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:34.320
JESSICA G: More than my mom like with my mom, I'm already past the point where I've accepted it already. Okay, but what what messing with me right now and it's like I i end up like mentally exhausted, like at the end of the day is with my son's dad.

304
00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

305
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.570
JESSICA G: I feel like okay

306
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So this might be happening. They're very common in romantic relationships. Okay, so let's confirm a set your alarm so that you can get in here.

307
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Next time. Nice and loud.

308
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's make it for like set it for like 1045 or something. So you

309
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.200
JESSICA G: Better for 10 O'clock usually

310
00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The last one I got you from March second. Okay.

311
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.260
JESSICA G: Okay.

312
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, my dear. All right, I will talk to you in group.

313
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.670
JESSICA G: Okay, can you ask the doctor, she can push me something till tomorrow, please.

314
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You bet. I'll do it right now.

315
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:16.500
JESSICA G: Bye.

316
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

317
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:34.680
Bethany Shadid: Oh,

318
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta send a quick message to the doctor.

319
00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Much for everyone may need a vacation. So let me just do a quick message.

320
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:18.990
Alright.

321
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

322
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Male I was I'm

323
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm confused about it. I'm probably behind a few steps regarding okay your insurance and the frustration involved in that. I'm just assume I know very, very, very little that I saw a little message come through that you were saying something about

324
00:52:50.280 --> 00:53:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's not let's just cut to the end part. Do you feel that there has been some solution to being able to have individual therapy and group covered either more so or completely through your carrier

325
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:11.940
Bethany Shadid: No, there's no resolution.

326
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been trying to get in touch.

327
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:28.710
Bethany Shadid: With me for billing for quite a while now. I'm all, I called her back. I just told Jamie when I checked in to let her know that I'm available all today because

328
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:40.530
Bethany Shadid: I was told she contact me on Monday. Um, I'm actually going to have my friend helped me with this because she works in insurance.

329
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:54.600
Bethany Shadid: And see, because there's gotta be a way if they don't offer services that cover all this from somebody else and make sure the paid for this.

330
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

331
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:56.640
Like yeah

332
00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Right.

333
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:09.510
Bethany Shadid: That's what I'm trying to get worked out. In the meantime, and I'm like, I've just been paying out of pocket for the visits. I've been to, which is why I only

334
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:14.730
Bethany Shadid: Have been kind of able to go to one thing week. Yeah.

335
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just finish this. I'm trying to start a conversation. Who's the person in charge of billing. I thought it was Krista beginning, I am hearing from a client.

336
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That a person because I don't know. India named

337
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:35.460
Bethany Shadid: Nick is he and he he is turning he

338
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the

339
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.160
Bethany Shadid: And the reason

340
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Person for billing, please.

341
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Please, please, please, please, please, please direct me so I can add vocation for my client. Let me just get descent. Okay.

342
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:04.440
Bethany Shadid: Otherwise, then be here with no help here. Okay. From my clan.

343
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see where this gets us because while we're talking, she can be working to try and figure out who's a good person and this will

344
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.890
Bethany Shadid: Re

345
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Really starts a conversation where they say, oh, I'm available. Or I can say, real quick, would you please email. Please check your inbox for

346
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Me so it can move it much faster. Once I kind of get my nose in there.

347
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:40.530
Bethany Shadid: Okay I. The reason I reached out to her just, you know, is because I went back in my emails and found she was the one who additional initially emailed me about the insurance stuff.

348
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, might be just a care navigator or something and really

349
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.400
Bethany Shadid: I heard it was I heard it was her and the one you're talking about Krista

350
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Krista beginning

351
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've worked with Chris

352
00:55:54.150 --> 00:56:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've worked with her several times she presents very confident. So my guess is it has a lot to do with, I don't know, but I don't know who he is.

353
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's

354
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: See, let's see what the pushback is here. Okay, okay, okay. So let's get to it.

355
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.610
Bethany Shadid: Think about it, right.

356
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your time. This is precious stuff for you. So let's just think

357
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

358
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Lease parents

359
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

360
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That wasn't

361
00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got an event at work. All of these your life continues to present challenges.

362
00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpersonal challenges, think, think about look kind of into the future. It's an hour later, how you want to feel

363
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How you want to feel when

364
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:46.590
Bethany Shadid: You sleep.

365
00:56:48.750 --> 00:57:01.230
Bethany Shadid: Right, I actually feel pretty good today. Okay. And I think using the time I should update you on a few things, but

366
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:11.610
Bethany Shadid: How would you say

367
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.540
Bethany Shadid: I need to be able to

368
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:32.280
Bethany Shadid: Leave this section and work on, you know, stuff for me, that doesn't involve work and stuff and

369
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:35.850
Bethany Shadid: I think I need

370
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.930
Bethany Shadid: I definitely realized that my internal reflection about things.

371
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.290
Bethany Shadid: Take contributes to my ongoing

372
00:57:53.640 --> 00:58:02.040
Bethany Shadid: anxiety and stress, like, and I've been trying to stop at, um,

373
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:10.050
Bethany Shadid: So, and I still been waking up with migraines every day. I'm a little

374
00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:22.200
Bethany Shadid: Or I should say a little I'm a way of whack. Because I have not gotten my birth control refilled for this month yet and so

375
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.270
Bethany Shadid: I've already emailed my doctor about it and everything, but

376
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:37.620
Bethany Shadid: I'm it's been too long. I'm just gonna have to go without it this month, but that definitely causes a lot of other things. Absolutely.

377
00:58:38.820 --> 00:59:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so let's look at this again, there's a sense of both wanting to fill me in. Just make sure you check in and see, is this because of an old need right for validation check in on it because I already you're already the good guy here. Okay, I'm gonna, I'm on your side. That's a given.

378
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.320
Bethany Shadid: Right.

379
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have to justify it.

380
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is there something going on with one of these things that are happening that it's going to be very useful and we can take that story, and we can sort of apply

381
00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been, will you call internal reflection I might say is it rumination. Is it obsessive thinking, Is it staying in the negative neural network is it

382
00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Worrying about what other people think. Is it some of those things we've already identified and you're just over

383
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Using an adaptation that you developed a long time ago. You're just over using this thing and we really just need to shift you over to this other thinking this other doing so that you can be productive because you want to be productive. It sounds like for the day.

384
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.030
Bethany Shadid: Right. That's, yeah, that's it.

385
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:58.770
Bethany Shadid: Okay, I don't want to get the details, you know, of everything, but there are two things that I think I should update you on my parents and then

386
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.350
Bethany Shadid: I was able to

387
01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

388
01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

389
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we we haven't really bad connect with you talking over you were, um, let's do this for just a minute. Let's turn turn your video off for a little bit because I hate to say it, but the connection is just so bad and I keep talking over you and I hate doing that.

390
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we just flip. What if we flip the order around and you tell me the reflection.

391
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative thinking the obsessive thinking if it is the rumination. If it's been, I've been running through my head.

392
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This thought about myself or this relationship with let's say it's your father or your mother. I keep rethinking replaying this over, could I have done it differently, like can I hear what you're doing inside your head and then we'll get the story after. Can we flip

393
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.080
Bethany Shadid: It. Yeah, okay.

394
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.280
Bethany Shadid: So I would say it's not

395
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.400
Bethany Shadid: Like self.

396
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:23.910
Bethany Shadid: It's not negative against myself it's and it's not what could I have done differently. It's literally going back over scenarios that took place like the situation with my parents or at work and almost like

397
01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.510
Bethany Shadid: gathering evidence or or

398
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:43.830
Bethany Shadid: Or proof of some kind, and I definitely know that that you know plays into my core issues, you know, meeting to be believed, meeting to be

399
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:55.770
Bethany Shadid: Good. And I actually told a coworker, a little bit about some of that at work this week because I realize, you know, I told her you know I have this

400
01:01:56.310 --> 01:02:09.870
Bethany Shadid: desperate need to be believed. And so whenever something that touches on that I tend to over explain it. I told her, you can just say, Bethany i got i believe when we can move on.

401
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:29.910
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so, but that's exactly what it is. It's not cutting myself down. It's not anything like that. It's, it's almost like pulling things out and going, yeah. Oh, yeah. Remember that that was, you know, or

402
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:41.160
Bethany Shadid: And I don't know, I think my mom and dad have always taken it as the victim.

403
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:54.090
Bethany Shadid: Mentality you know like bringing those things up in conversation. So you know what i mean it's, it doesn't come across to anybody else. The way that I wanted to

404
01:02:55.140 --> 01:03:00.600
Bethany Shadid: Like me defending myself or whatever, it comes across as me feeling sorry for myself.

405
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:07.830
Bethany Shadid: And I just realized that it takes up so much of my

406
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.390
Bethany Shadid: free time, so right.

407
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the scene. Yeah, right.

408
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I said it in here like, you know, do I really need to hear your story, or is it already good enough believable enough that you think it, you feel it. You don't have to explain to me. You don't have to explain your coworker.

409
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But you haven't given up hope. Remember that those list of things about how to sort of deal with the gaslighting I think you may have backs little, little bit

410
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You had contact with them recently, maybe this maybe maybe this one, then they'll get it. Well, I've got some good points. I'll make these points. See, these are, this is proof clearly they're wrong. This is all they'll hear me.

411
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This time. Yeah. Oh, you're back to doing this thing where you wish things were different, yeah and and I

412
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:35.430
Bethany Shadid: didn't see it coming at all. I know I back slid I just desperately because of the issues at work wanted somebody to hear me, and I, I really went into it with my parents and then got it completely different reaction than I was expecting. And it really devastated me and oh so suck.

413
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.630
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it was it's it's it's

414
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:54.000
Bethany Shadid: It's hard because I can look back and see exactly what was happening. But at the time, you know, they're asking me how my life is and it just all comes out and I don't realize

415
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:55.500
But

416
01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Honey,

417
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When these two people ask you how your life is you say just fine. Thank you for asking how is yours.

418
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We do not open our heart right is trust is making vulnerable, the things that are important to us. You make vulnerable to people that have earned your trust.

419
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the true do that right. I need to earn it first.

420
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: She needs to he needs to all these different people need to earn it. We need to earn your trust.

421
01:05:41.370 --> 01:06:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't give it away, give us a little bit. See how if we treat it gently this stuff that you make vulnerable to someone else that's trust you went like this. Why would you do that right you forgot, they're not going to be accountable. They can't sorry about your father, but he's in the same

422
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.450
Bethany Shadid: Business

423
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he has to survive. He has to maintain his role also

424
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:06.900
Bethany Shadid: Right.

425
01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But you you hoped and

426
01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, we should want our parents to choose love and kindness over there, there need to to be right, we wish it was so but

427
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.200
Bethany Shadid: Just right

428
01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got disappointed you hoped that maybe

429
01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a good enough argument they would see your side.

430
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.240
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I was so desperate.

431
01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:43.560
Bethany Shadid: To have somebody listen outside of my work, you know,

432
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.540
Bethany Shadid: People, because I I am

433
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:54.330
Bethany Shadid: I'm not socializing.

434
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:55.380
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

435
01:06:56.190 --> 01:07:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's happening there as soon as you go back into church you reconnect. And that has a place to land and

436
01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: For in a loving way. So over these last couple weeks. Does it seem like with all this problem solving this been going on with the lease and maybe with Braveheart that you've had to pull back a little bit and you haven't been able to

437
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear from people. Oh, I see. Yeah, that's reasonable. I get it. You haven't been able to have that social engagement.

438
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yeah.

439
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.090
Bethany Shadid: I also the social engagement. I do have right now has been

440
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:42.540
Bethany Shadid: Really it's added a lot to my plate. And so it's hard. I think to social or or

441
01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.920
Bethany Shadid: Try and pursue that when

442
01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.110
Bethany Shadid: What you

443
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.730
Bethany Shadid: Know, or what's going on is so draining already

444
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So am I. Am I behind here. Are you dating someone or something. Am I missing.

445
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.170
A piece of mo.

446
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:06.300
Bethany Shadid: Oh gosh, my coworker.

447
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:07.890
Bethany Shadid: That

448
01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:10.620
Bethany Shadid: They're frightened did

449
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:15.060
Bethany Shadid: She got so depressed, to the point that my boss had her

450
01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:18.870
Bethany Shadid: Sent to the hospital.

451
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that.

452
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:23.760
Bethany Shadid: Actually, and then. Yeah. And then my other co worker.

453
01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:31.830
Bethany Shadid: I'm her son tried to kill themselves this past weekend and she's been in the hospital.

454
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.490
Bethany Shadid: In the ICU with him.

455
01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:38.400
Bethany Shadid: And

456
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.330
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, it's, you know, other stuff. But those are the big ones in it.

457
01:08:46.380 --> 01:09:03.510
Bethany Shadid: So, you, you know, want to be there and you end up not in a bad way. But you realize that the interaction. You do have is you pouring out, you know, love and and try to be there for that person. And you're already not doing so great.

458
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.910
Bethany Shadid: But, yeah, yeah.

459
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I texted you. Just a little check in this weekend or sometime very recently, and

460
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You had mentioned that you were with someone

461
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:22.320
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

462
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I guess what I wonder is

463
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it still so familiar. And so habitual to spend time with people that right are kind of unavailable for you.

464
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're you're in a vulnerable spot and be nice for you to be around people that are emotionally available for you, not again in the role of the giver.

465
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the caregiver, because that's kind of what these friendships are looking like again.

466
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's selfish, um,

467
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we all need to have some people that are maybe their mentors are there people that oh and, you know, I've got this attribute of this quality that maybe you would like to have

468
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see any of those people that maybe you could spend some time with

469
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:20.190
Bethany Shadid: Well, I see exactly what you're talking about. And I definitely

470
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.360
Bethany Shadid: Think that's exactly

471
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.620
Bethany Shadid: It. I think I'm more comfortable around people that are also hurting

472
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.050
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, um,

473
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:40.650
Bethany Shadid: I don't know. I don't know if it just makes me feel better about myself or

474
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.170
Bethany Shadid: Or if it's that you know these people are able to

475
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.840
Bethany Shadid: Be real

476
01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:53.550
Bethany Shadid: And they don't think you're broken and damaged and

477
01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:01.710
Bethany Shadid: And I think the friends that I do have that are, you know, able to give

478
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:10.230
Bethany Shadid: Or would be are not able to because of their just their own life. So

479
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.380
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I don't, I would have to

480
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.870
Bethany Shadid: Make new friends and connections, I think.

481
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.890
Bethany Shadid: Outside of work.

482
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but church has been a place of refueling and replenishment so

483
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder, has there been a slight drift away from that over the last couple weeks.

484
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.700
Bethany Shadid: Yes. Okay.

485
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're feeling it.

486
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:44.790
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, okay.

487
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So no judgment about it. But this is how it shows up.

488
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.320
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, right.

489
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now until you internalize this Bethany until you really get

490
01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That the stuff that you're receiving from the outside that you have it deep inside and then it's yours.

491
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

492
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I would love to have you surrounded by people that that hold you up to the light to hold you up.

493
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:09.840
Yeah.

494
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not on to them. Maybe because I'm they might criticize you, or something. I'm not sure it's

495
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:29.130
Bethany Shadid: You know, it's interesting because as we've been talking about it. It's almost like I cringe thinking about it and

496
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:36.120
Bethany Shadid: Okay, it feels uncomfortable. I don't think I've

497
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.550
Bethany Shadid: I don't know that I know.

498
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.800
Bethany Shadid: What to look for, I don't know that I know.

499
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's let me just check on video, we can only

500
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Play with the bandwidth. Let's just check on it. Um, let's check and see if it's any good.

501
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: With your video and

502
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Essentially been he just chirping and somebody out there. Yeah, we're you

503
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.010
Bethany Shadid: Know,

504
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just see how this how this goes.

505
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:18.210
Bethany Shadid: It seems okay from my side.

506
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, so good. So let's stay there, let's stay with the cringe. Okay.

507
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because something just happened.

508
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, why don't I throw out some words and you go, yeah, that's the one that's the one that makes the body cringe.

509
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, confident

510
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Arrogant

511
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.010
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

512
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.930
Narcissistic

513
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi hyper

514
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: overly talkative.

515
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Demonstrative which means right you very animated in hand motions and storytelling.

516
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:10.200
Bethany Shadid: No.

517
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:11.580
Knowledgeable

518
01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Insightful

519
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Busy

520
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Selfish

521
01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Generous

522
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:37.650
Yeah.

523
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So curious generous right

524
01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:47.580
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so the

525
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Three. I wrote down. We're an arrogance busy arrogant generous.

526
01:14:58.230 --> 01:14:59.910
Bethany Shadid: I think I'm thinking about

527
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.820
Bethany Shadid: Speech specific

528
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:08.010
Bethany Shadid: Things relationship wise with friends and

529
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.870
Bethany Shadid: I have friends that I love, but

530
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.120
Bethany Shadid: I feel such a

531
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.090
Bethany Shadid: Like if I were to really

532
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:34.020
Bethany Shadid: Be vulnerable or

533
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.630
Bethany Shadid: Open and

534
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:48.000
Bethany Shadid: Or allow somebody to love and help me. Yeah, that I would be

535
01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.810
Bethany Shadid: kind of trapped

536
01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:09.090
Bethany Shadid: I would, I would not feel comfortable. A lot of my friends are very generous in it does make me feel very comfortable.

537
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:22.830
Bethany Shadid: And so I live in my, you know, or, or I feel like I would totally have to buy into that person's. It's like an all or nothing like

538
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If I got their generosity, I have to believe everything they say I have to agree with everything they say, I'm going to be sacrificing my integrity.

539
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:40.200
Bethany Shadid: We're getting close that or my time my

540
01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:42.930
Bethany Shadid: My

541
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.240
Bethany Shadid: What I do

542
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:50.340
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

543
01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:01.950
Bethany Shadid: Almost like by doing that, I would give that person, you know, the ability to

544
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:10.710
Bethany Shadid: Run my life almost it's slick, even though that's not what I'm thinking. I just get the I get the cringe but

545
01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:12.090
So,

546
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we got here. We've got a half hour. Do you happen to have. I think this is a really for me out here. I can see a lot of what's going on. I know you're in. It's harder to see it.

547
01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:23.910
Bethany Shadid: You know,

548
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the ability to do the bilateral

549
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:27.510
Bethany Shadid: Do you have to say.

550
01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's put those together.

551
01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And how distressed. Are you right now zero to 100. Let me just check in on that hundred

552
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:47.760
Bethany Shadid: Like 75

553
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, yeah, that's what I thought. Because I'm recognizing what you're saying right now. So this doesn't surprise.

554
01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So let's see.

555
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:10.770
Bethany Shadid: I'm pretty surprised, actually. But I'm glad you know what's going on.

556
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.110
Bethany Shadid: I'm just gonna go with it.

557
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just go with it. So,

558
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got your two years two objects over there. Right.

559
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.190
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, okay, good.

560
01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, I want to do some installing with you have those positive

561
01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoo. I want to do installing as a positive quality figures first

562
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:39.420
Bethany Shadid: Because you're a

563
01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:41.370
Trinity.

564
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your

565
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective figure. Yeah, the nurturing figure and the width wise.

566
01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to we want to get those present

567
01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll do a nice slow iteration. Once I haven't done any today, so I gotta find that, oh, it's my finger, because you're on the phone, right.

568
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.590
Bethany Shadid: Now I'm on my iPad.

569
01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can do the light

570
01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you prefer.

571
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you prefer, looking at the corner with my finger or the light

572
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:16.950
Bethany Shadid: I don't think we've done the finger.

573
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.070
Bethany Shadid: Go for

574
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How does that feel

575
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:28.470
Bethany Shadid: I think I'm able to follow it a little more smoothly.

576
01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Don't move your head, your, your eyes moving because we only want the bilateral with the eyes. Okay. Okay, so I can dev only you're only my first one. So I won't be hurting my shoulder will do that today. Okay.

577
01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: He okay so we won't do blue light will do my index finger. Great. So let's do this.

578
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do some imagery, close your eyes for a little bit. Let's pull up that awareness.

579
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Of

580
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When he

581
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Katie

582
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: They're tough friends who have always looked out for you. They have a good sense of humor.

583
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: They have the ability to give you a reality check and get you to a place where you can laugh.

584
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And of course God

585
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Protected quality.

586
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And in nurturing

587
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: We have Becky.

588
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Wilson and of course later on Jesus Christ.

589
01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Becky is sort of embodied in this spiritual imagery as an angel.

590
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like a second mama.

591
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picturing

592
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: God

593
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe having Katie having people, it's helpful to have real people. It grounds you even more picturing the quality with Katie and Monique humans aren't perfect. But they can

594
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: They can still embody these qualities of protective

595
01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And then also have

596
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This imagery of Jesus Christ there with them as well as Becky Wilson as a nurturer and just see who, if it changes. If it doesn't work, just sort of pay attention.

597
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then of course the

598
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise figure is the Holy Spirit.

599
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If a real or imagined figure does come up

600
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To add things or remove things just see if they can all interact in some way. Always for your benefit.

601
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.950
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I have a pretty solid imagery of it.

602
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go ahead and open your eyes.

603
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's go at this pace. This is nice and slow. Just look at the corner of your iPad, not my finger, necessarily, which is the corner of the iPad.

604
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to hold on to that imagery

605
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We had it pretty solid. A little bit ago

606
01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: These are your people. Is your team.

607
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: may slow down a little bit.

608
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're really feeling that presence.

609
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a scan of your body.

610
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: See if there's any charge left

611
01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice where it is in the body.

612
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tell me, but just pay attention while you're holding

613
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: These figures.

614
01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together, inhale through the nose.

615
01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale out of the mouth.

616
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

617
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Very gently.

618
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Sir,

619
01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

620
01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just something fall

621
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.620
Bethany Shadid: Yes, it'll be ok though.

622
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Back or something. Maybe split off account or something.

623
01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.610
Yeah.

624
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:08.580
Bethany Shadid: Actually, I felt very good just, you know, right, even, even into before we did the

625
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

626
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:17.760
Bethany Shadid: They were saying, but my guess my question is am I supposed to be thinking also about the bad thing.

627
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:18.960
Bethany Shadid: No, no.

628
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You can rely on my invitation. If I dropped the ball and that's on me, but I didn't. This was just the interweaving of the positive you are really high and distress. So I wanted you to kind of feel a little better.

629
01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So what number you out in distress right now.

630
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:40.500
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I'm good, like a like a 4050

631
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.150
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

632
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we were at 75 and now we're at a maybe a 45 at this point.

633
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.180
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, okay.

634
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So still so it's not zero. So notice, and notice how you're good at pretty high level in distress, you're

635
01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.200
Bethany Shadid: Fine.

636
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your baseline still pretty high.

637
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this

638
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a good is a good place for sort of stretching and growth in there. So that might be a good place for us. So let's just go there and whenever you this. You do not have to wait for any invitation. You can always pull them in

639
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:23.640
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

640
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you don't have to wait for me that is available to you.

641
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:35.010
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I started trying to do it on my way to work when I would notice you know getting distressed.

642
01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.860
Bethany Shadid: Good. Yeah, and

643
01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can add all of it. I'm going to have them in my tiny little room and my tiny house. I've got a compartment for the things that I don't want to think about right now. I'm only going to be present with the reinforcement of what is absolutely good lovable.

644
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong about me right now.

645
01:25:58.500 --> 01:25:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want

646
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:00.060
You just

647
01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And the rest of it. And you can even take that compartment that container and have it float down the river or whatever your distancing metaphor is let me see if we've got one in here. We don't have

648
01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have a distancing. And we have a jar for your container. Yeah. So, okay, well, I need to get a distancing metaphor in there too. So look, but let's start with this with the time we have. Okay, so let's go to 45 we're at 45

649
01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And we have this. Now we're going to go to the negative for just a moment. I want you to think about

650
01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to accept something means sacrificing

651
01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Your time

652
01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And see what else you're sacrificing just name a couple things.

653
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Think the time, but I don't think it is.

654
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:09.060
Bethany Shadid: Being being me.

655
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Being you

656
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.080
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, and comfort.

657
01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Me and comfort.

658
01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:20.430
Yep.

659
01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And tracking back because it be good to find the core

660
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory of this, the Court image. Once the earliest time you realized there was an exchange here I if I'm going to accept this.

661
01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna have to sacrifice.

662
01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: pretty old.

663
01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, kind of thought, so how how old. How old are you,

664
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:58.890
Bethany Shadid: Right, don't exactly know

665
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:06.240
Bethany Shadid: I just remember, I must have been early teens. Okay, but

666
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.150
Bethany Shadid: It was when

667
01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.370
Bethany Shadid: I realized

668
01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:21.240
Bethany Shadid: With my mother that gifts are gifts that there's strings attached.

669
01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:32.520
Bethany Shadid: And stepped in it meant I had to have a good attitude. I did.

670
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:36.390
Bethany Shadid: He had it. I had it and

671
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:37.470
That's it.

672
01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

673
01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

674
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the belief about yourself that you have to pretend

675
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to pretend that the belief. I can't be me see what it is. What's your truth.

676
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.620
Bethany Shadid: I don't know if I have it all figured out.

677
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll just go with this one. Then I have to pretend

678
01:29:12.630 --> 01:29:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see where that gets us

679
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the positive belief, you would have liked to have had in your teens back then.

680
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.170
Huh.

681
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:32.490
Bethany Shadid: That if somebody really loves me and is really

682
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.580
Bethany Shadid: My friend.

683
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.880
Bethany Shadid: I don't have to pretend to

684
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.970
Bethany Shadid: For pretend I'm

685
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.360
Bethany Shadid: Like really excited about everything that they want to do, or

686
01:29:56.250 --> 01:30:03.510
Bethany Shadid: That I, you know, bend over that I basically subject myself to everything personal

687
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And

688
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself in this idea, right. The opposite of I have to pretend. How do we label the belief the ideal belief I am

689
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:27.030
Bethany Shadid: Who I am is not good enough.

690
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a negative one.

691
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.510
Now,

692
01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can find a positive one.

693
01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:38.400
Bethany Shadid: So,

694
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you know you did. Perfect. You're doing just beautifully. Let's see if we can get to a positive one. Back then, right, if you could have replaced. I'm not good enough. And I have to pretend that wasn't

695
01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The cognition. If that wasn't the belief and you could have instead had a positive one, one that nourish the soul reinforced who you are your core. What might the belief have been

696
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.700
Bethany Shadid: Good with

697
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:27.000
Bethany Shadid: Generosity would have been accepted as a positive thing and not reflected on me and how I feel about myself. Oh.

698
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are treated. Yeah, you're almost there. If you were treated right if you were given the space to interpret generosity as a real gift, which they're supposed to be no one wants anything in return. That's what gift means okay so if you had the ability if gifts were actually given

699
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What might you have believed about yourself.

700
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

701
01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

702
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just check and see how you're doing. How distressed. Are you right now. What number are we at

703
01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.740
Bethany Shadid: I'm a Gemini. Okay.

704
01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do some more of the slow. So, we will take will take a little negative that negative one, pull up that negative. You probably got a picture of your mom. Maybe you were a teenager or something like that, okay, I understand that.

705
01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you to take that that picture.

706
01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: With them.

707
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Realization that worst image and let's integrate the positive images. So get in touch with my people.

708
01:32:45.720 --> 01:33:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And in touch with them. So it's going to be those two things. It's going to be that worst image that realization as a teenager. It's not a gift. Right. It's something else. Pull in your awareness in your consciousness, all of the resources of protective quality right

709
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing Jesus Christ.

710
01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Those

711
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Other mama good momma.

712
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy Spirit.

713
01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow down a little bit.

714
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst image.

715
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: With the presence of your people.

716
01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep your head still just those little eyes moving

717
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's inhale together nice inhale.

718
01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale

719
01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn your introspection in pay attention to your body. See what's being signaled

720
01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's unsettled.

721
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And charged

722
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:47.400
Bethany Shadid: Well that was a pretty perfect way to

723
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.250
Bethany Shadid: Reduce my anxiety level back down or distress.

724
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:58.620
Bethany Shadid: Okay, because I, the thing that immediately came to me.

725
01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:01.980
Bethany Shadid: Was this selfless love

726
01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.220
Bethany Shadid: Christ in him.

727
01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:07.680
Bethany Shadid: Dying for me.

728
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:11.550
Bethany Shadid: And not expecting anything in return.

729
01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm a

730
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:20.820
Bethany Shadid: You know juxtaposed with what I was learning your, you know, as a child.

731
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.860
Bethany Shadid: You know,

732
01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:25.440
Okay. Um, so

733
01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to go with that go with that. Hold that juxtaposition. Hold it pull up that worst image that realization as a teenager. Well, those two together, go with that.

734
01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: In the nose.

735
01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly breath in and

736
01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:36.780
Bethany Shadid: Out.

737
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you picking up on

738
01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:57.570
Bethany Shadid: Controlled

739
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.670
Bethany Shadid: I like I feel

740
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:05.280
Bethany Shadid: How

741
01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.920
Bethany Shadid: It's so ingrained in me.

742
01:37:14.670 --> 01:37:15.540
Bethany Shadid: And

743
01:37:17.970 --> 01:37:25.410
Bethany Shadid: The connection for the detachment I seek everywhere else, because I don't

744
01:37:27.810 --> 01:37:28.800
Bethany Shadid: You know, I can't

745
01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:31.620
Bethany Shadid: It's so

746
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:34.830
Great.

747
01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.330
Bethany Shadid: It's, it's almost like a different reality you face.

748
01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been seeking

749
01:37:46.710 --> 01:37:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Detachment elsewhere because you can't get

750
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. Let's see what happens with that. Okay. Okay.

751
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Go with that hold up that WORST piece.

752
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to go with that.

753
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing

754
01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:52.320
Bethany Shadid: A lot of different relationships.

755
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:56.850
Bethany Shadid: That

756
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:02.520
Bethany Shadid: have either been

757
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.770
Bethany Shadid: Afraid or or I

758
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:12.150
Bethany Shadid: Some for some reason in romantic relationships.

759
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:14.400
Bethany Shadid: It's

760
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.820
Bethany Shadid: I pour all of me. You know, like, really fast because

761
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.620
Bethany Shadid: I so desperately want to share that connection.

762
01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:30.120
Bethany Shadid: But

763
01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:33.840
Bethany Shadid: I don't

764
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:44.670
Bethany Shadid: How do you, how you were saying earlier, I don't let people I don't give them a little and see if I can trust them with it, give it all.

765
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, Nicole.

766
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm desperate want you to pull pull up that worst image that realization back when you were a team. We're going to go with that this might be our last one. Let's just see.

767
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Nice and slow.

768
01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If you haven't already done it, bring in your people bring them in.

769
01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:55.680
See what happens.

770
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.530
Inhale.

771
01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale

772
01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: attuned to your own rhythm Bethany just feel it.

773
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: In your body. It's got its own pace.

774
01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Some flow.

775
01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What are some of the thoughts or beliefs or physical experiences or emotions that came a little

776
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.010
Bethany Shadid: Well, I realized

777
01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:31.140
Bethany Shadid: After you

778
01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.630
Bethany Shadid: Have been, you know, halfway through said, you know, if you haven't already.

779
01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:40.650
Bethany Shadid: I realized I was holding my breath.

780
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:45.810
Bethany Shadid: Thinking about just how

781
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:53.550
Bethany Shadid: Desperate. I am for unconditional love.

782
01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.610
Bethany Shadid: And then realize the very habits.

783
01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.190
Bethany Shadid: But

784
01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:10.170
Bethany Shadid: losing sight of that is so easy for me to do.

785
01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:14.250
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

786
01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.990
Bethany Shadid: Yeah yeah I

787
01:43:20.850 --> 01:43:22.710
Bethany Shadid: Never would have made this connection.

788
01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.160
Bethany Shadid: Oh geez.

789
01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: No thing.

790
01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's good to know that prayer feels good, you know, remembering, you know that you have come to time and again with imagery, we start with

791
01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we end with this unconditional stuff we end with with God. Jesus with the Holy Spirit we come back to that again and again and again, because it's perfect.

792
01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Evelyn's about it, it's just

793
01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exactly what you need. You, you cannot be in the space of this mixed message. It's just so uncomfortable.

794
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You will

795
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not take care of yourself. You want other people, their feelings. First, you'll do it nine out of 10 times as an

796
01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:26.820
Bethany Shadid: Endless wonder too if there isn't a component that

797
01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:42.540
Bethany Shadid: My I do that with females. And it's the men in romantic relationships that I want that unconditional that commitment that I don't know.

798
01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, we're almost out of time. I've got to run a group, but let me you don't have. You don't have to do that analysis if you don't want to. You're more than welcome to obviously that's your own mind. But, in my perspective, it's

799
01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:58.620
Bethany Shadid: In general,

800
01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's not about gender.

801
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Really about that. It's a romantic relationship with the reason

802
01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's not even the romance part. It has to do with we end up hooking up with people okay to heal.

803
01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: They tend to be people that embody I think I've talked to you about this. A Mongo, they tend to have even though we think we're going to go. I'm going to spend time with the opposite person of my mother. I want someone nothing like my father, sure enough, there they are, again,

804
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.880
There with

805
01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how that wasn't there on the first day that I married this person. There it is.

806
01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's just kind of our way intrinsically and intuitively to want to heal those wounds wounded relationships. This

807
01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This relationship, the one that romantic one love is on the line, just like our childhood, this one.

808
01:45:58.770 --> 01:45:59.250
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

809
01:45:59.670 --> 01:46:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So to have it be that intense can either be healing or again at once. So again, but I wouldn't get too hung up on

810
01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This year,

811
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.040
Bethany Shadid: No worries.

812
01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if you're right. Today you have things to do.

813
01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you put in your jar having to do what you started to do right at the end, which was analyze. You don't have to

814
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:40.380
Bethany Shadid: You don't. Okay. You don't have to analyze that you have your list of things to do that you want to accomplish today they made it to the list. Just go to

815
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:41.700
Bethany Shadid: My

816
01:46:42.450 --> 01:46:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure it's a great idea.

817
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.350
Yeah.

818
01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the thing I talked about having to analyze and and think, well, what is what in mind, read

819
01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:54.450
Bethany Shadid: Why

820
01:46:55.290 --> 01:46:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To do it now. What

821
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:59.460
Bethany Shadid: So the session, by the way.

822
01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:01.110
Bethany Shadid: So,

823
01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Spending your time going to those images. Okay, catch your as soon as you start to analyze do the thought stopping say thank you. You've gotten me as far as I have you've kept me alive. Thank you. You're not going to lose the skill you're not going to lose it.

824
01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go to faith.

825
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.650
Bethany Shadid: Okay, Neely

826
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: analysis paralysis face function.

827
01:47:29.250 --> 01:47:29.700
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

828
01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.070
Bethany Shadid: Really

829
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:33.990
Bethany Shadid: Probably

830
01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay I record to you again and hopefully I did see a little something that came through that site that they're both in charge of billing

831
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What she said to me, she said, Krista and near are in charge of billing, I would. I don't know who he is. I would go back into virtual clinic and say, hey, can someone please

832
01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: schedule a time so that I can either video conference with Krista spinning and I can be there too. I've been there sometimes for a couple minutes. I don't think you'll need me there. But that might get the point across.

833
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:11.220
Okay.

834
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

835
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you soon. But text me if you need any help for me.

836
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.750
Bethany Shadid: Okay, thank you.

837
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:23.310
Bethany Shadid: Hey,
