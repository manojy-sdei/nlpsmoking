00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.860
Daniel Guerrero: You know, everybody gets tired eating like McDonald's or Burger King. You know, everybody gets tired of that same tasty want something different, you know,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But why are you getting the short end of the stick. I'm not getting up

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I think they would want

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.900
Daniel Guerrero: We're super busy.

37
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.490

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something that interests you. Would you like to have that. I mean, I think.

45
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be great for you wouldn't

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.830
Daniel Guerrero: Open that would be that'd be more than great

47
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, why won't they put one. Once you pick up a shift doing that. What's the problem with you doing it. What's your boss saying about that.

48
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.990
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

49
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.770

50
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.780
Daniel Guerrero: Nobody

51
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know anybody who could take that spot.

52
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.590
Daniel Guerrero: Hey, but trust me, if I did, they would already be there.

53
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.520
Okay.

54
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.380
Daniel Guerrero: Real

55
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

56
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

57
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's nobody that wants to take your spot learn a new skill and then you switch it out like every other week or something.

58
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, hey,

59
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.000
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's the sad part about it is, is that you know this guy.

60
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.800
Daniel Guerrero: You frustrates me man because he depends on me too much. You know,

61
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.960
Daniel Guerrero: And

62
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.260
Daniel Guerrero: Would that dependency comes

63
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.010
Daniel Guerrero: Up for myself it's it's a

64
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.820
Daniel Guerrero: I'm limited to what I can do. You know, like

65
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.120
Daniel Guerrero: You know, here's a good example is because

66
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.000
Daniel Guerrero: In July, July 7 19 you know my daughter graduates in Abilene, Texas. I don't know if you know where Abilene, Texas is a

67
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.100
Well, anyways.

68
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.030
Daniel Guerrero: It's kind of like in the mill mill Texas.

69
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:27.090
Daniel Guerrero: She graduates from high school, man. I haven't been in her life for past 13 years 14 years, man. And I told him I'm going to that graduation and

70
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.760
Daniel Guerrero: You know, pretty much shit on himself because he don't know he's what he's going to do for the next for those two days. No, I told him I'm

71
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.850
Daniel Guerrero: I'm giving you a two and a half months notice that I'm leaving on this days and there's definitely going to do about it. There's nothing to go change my mind about going

72
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So seriously this this boss of yours.

73
00:05:50.370 --> 00:06:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If he could have you training someone that could be your end like you could be training someone and they know how to do it. And then when you come back, there's no excuse for I got somebody you know that you can switch. You know, you know, I mean, this

74
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.270
Daniel Guerrero: It has

75
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.130
Daniel Guerrero: To make because

76
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.430
Daniel Guerrero: But he doesn't see it that way, you know, he

77
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:26.460
Daniel Guerrero: He simple minded. If you know if you know what I mean, you know, he only has he has a one track mind and this one track mind is like, this is what you do. This is what you do. And there's no alternatives to anything.

78
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.560
Daniel Guerrero: And this way I want it.

79
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he going to fire you. If you leave like what's really going to happen.

80
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.590
Daniel Guerrero: And honestly feel like, you know, because he's all like, well, I guess I'm gonna have to hire somebody else is what he told me

81
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.940
Daniel Guerrero: And I just kind of just like talking What do what you gotta do.

82
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.560
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

83
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.010
Daniel Guerrero: Because I think it's kind of shitty you know that

84
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.830
Daniel Guerrero: He knows the situation, you know,

85
00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.860
Daniel Guerrero: Anybody who knows me, you know that you know it is. I've been working there for almost a year now, you know, I'll be there a year in June.

86
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:17.490
Daniel Guerrero: Or July. Either way, I'd be there a year. Pretty, pretty soon, and I've only come in twice, you know, the whole year. And it wasn't the first time I called him was not

87
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.840
Daniel Guerrero: It was not intentional at all because I was

88
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.990
Daniel Guerrero: The night before I was feeling just fine.

89
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:33.030
Daniel Guerrero: And as the night progressed, I started getting sick, like I got like terrible sick and I couldn't make it towards the next day.

90
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.250
Daniel Guerrero: Even if I wanted to go to work, there'd be no way I could have made it, you know. And so that was the first time I called in.

91
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:53.010
Daniel Guerrero: And then the second time I called in was because my wife had has a friend whose daughter was only like 13 or 14 and she was running the streets in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

92
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.700
Daniel Guerrero: By herself nowhere to go.

93
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:08.190
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it was wintertime, no cloning, you know, she had this little windbreaker on you know what else to do. So she called us she reached out to us and I wouldn't picked her up, you know,

94
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.190
Daniel Guerrero: And brought her home. Well,

95
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.610
Daniel Guerrero: That was the second time that I call it

96
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:25.470
Daniel Guerrero: So bitterly in a whole year. I can count on my fingers, you know, a one hand. How many times you know I've left in, you know, called in or couldn't make it.

97
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.700
Daniel Guerrero: And he still had a problem with it you know it irritates the shit out of me because I do extra

98
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.720
Daniel Guerrero: I I maybe I'm just maybe I'm just in

99
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:45.360
Daniel Guerrero: I just felt like maybe he should have been like it's going to be tough, but I'll cover. Okay, you know, that's what I was expecting out of him.

100
00:08:46.380 --> 00:09:05.280
Daniel Guerrero: And I didn't get that. So it makes me feel like that the partnership that we have no not even partnership, the boss employee relationship that we have is pretty much like I thought it was like I got your back. You got my back. I stand by.

101
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, what evidence do you have

102
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That he has your back.

103
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.750
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, the only evidence that I that I have seen that he's got my back like Dan is if

104
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.170
Daniel Guerrero: You know what time I gotten a real good jam know yoga some money. I mean, of course I pay him back.

105
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:36.420
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you know, and that's only. That's the only evidence that there is is that if I need something and it helps me out with it.

106
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.100
Daniel Guerrero: So like, you're probably right. I don't even know if he does have my bag. I mean, because

107
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.110
Daniel Guerrero: The business is big business has been there for 32 years so

108
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.340
Daniel Guerrero: You're probably right on par young, you know,

109
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.120
Daniel Guerrero: Of course I'm replaceable but

110
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I am too. We are replaceable and same time. Listen, Daniel, you are incredibly special, unique and important. It's a both. It's both and thing I haven't heard much aside from that one story you just said about this boss of yours.

111
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

112
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: In line with the way you would be as a boss, I just wonder if you are imposing wishful thinking on to him.

113
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it would be convenient, but you've also said he's a simple guy, it's very

114
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Concrete meaning. This is your job description. This is what you do. This is your shift. This is what when you show up period, and he doesn't want to talk about it.

115
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.270
Daniel Guerrero: But you

116
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You've seen a couple other things that make me also wonder if that's completely true he he lent you money. You told me he lent you money, you were in a jam, he was able to do that, which does take

117
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: More thinking he had to trust you, that you would pay him back on there was something else. He did, which had to do with, he said.

118
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How much do you want to make here. You said 10 you got an increase the gotcha, all the way to 10 and then he said, well hey you're at 10 which you complain about that does take someone that actually is a little bit smarter than just

119
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's more smarts to him, then he's letting on

120
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:39.840
Daniel Guerrero: The other. I mean, well, he is. He is the son of, you know, the ex governor of New Mexico, you know,

121
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.390
Daniel Guerrero: So his, his dad was the governor of New Mexico. So they're like

122
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know, they're pretty intelligent people, you know, they're pretty smart. You know, they're well off, you know, so

123
00:11:51.870 --> 00:12:03.810
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like I'm expendable at his at his account because you could just be like, You know what, you can go ahead and just clock out. Go home, you're fired. You know, and what am I going to do it pretty simple, you know,

124
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.820
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

125
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be the harm in you, assuming that

126
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something that you could do to have something like really do your very best have something set up as just in case.

127
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.970
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I don't, because you know I put in all the exam.

128
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.710
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I remember I told you I had done this, the resume stuff and I

129
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: I, you know, I've put in application after application.

130
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.870
Daniel Guerrero: And I did receive one phone call back

131
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.330
Daniel Guerrero: Or you better the phone call that I had received was like

132
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.210
Daniel Guerrero: I just kind of felt like it wasn't

133
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:57.510
Daniel Guerrero: It wasn't for me because one rate of money would go down the loss of ours would go down.

134
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.790
Daniel Guerrero: The amount of hours. I got would go down the money to be made to go down.

135
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.590
Daniel Guerrero: And go

136
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.890
Daniel Guerrero: So I was just like, at that time, I wasn't in a position to take that

137
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

138
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:22.650
Daniel Guerrero: There's no way you know it's, there's no way I could a typical net, but there was, but going and working for that, you know, for this other food chain.

139
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:33.600
Daniel Guerrero: There's opportunity there was opportunity to grow into something else I know where I'm at, it's family owned. So this is as far as I'm going to get. Yeah.

140
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.950

170
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Bias. I bet it's something something stupid like a tattoo or something with your background. It has nothing to do with qualified your way overqualified, this is, this is the kind of next step I am

171
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.030
Daniel Guerrero: Knows

172
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.260

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.480
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I hope he fires me

174
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: As a fan.

175
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:50.790
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because, you know, it's hard for me. I'm gonna be honest with you right now. It's hard for me to move to another job because

176
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.640
Daniel Guerrero: Because I have so much relying on these every two weeks paychecks.

177
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:08.610
Daniel Guerrero: A lot, you know, you know, I have a lot of my bill setup to we're like, Okay, here's this, you know, two weeks and then in two weeks. Here's the other part in in two weeks. Here's the other part.

178
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:16.830
Daniel Guerrero: And so I have all my bills are we live paycheck to paycheck all my bills. Remind me to get paid every other Friday.

179
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:30.570
Daniel Guerrero: And finally paid every other Friday and it goes into, you know, there's a good chance to, you know, these people going to come in and start taking my shit, you know, you can start sending my bills off. I can't afford them. You know, because I

180
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.360
Daniel Guerrero: Was the same time.

181
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:43.260
Daniel Guerrero: I can barely afford working where I'm at, because a game of the day, you know, getting paid peanuts and it sucks ass, you know, but I'm like

182
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.630
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just feel like he has been in a in a tight spot right there, you know,

183
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But he doesn't that the this is the part that

184
00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is the choice that you have is to shift that thinking to

185
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I need to do to move forward. If you spend five minutes, two minutes even on this guy has me cornered.

186
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is still your choice. And I know it's an uncomfortable one

187
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But the freedom that comes from realizing that your, this is your choice. Okay.

188
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not like your choices. I'm not saying that I'm saying the choices are tough ones, but it will wipe you out if you feel cornered by someone else that they are run in your life.

189
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This is your choice.

190
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To be in this life to have this job to choose to not go risk.

191
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Go reaching out knocking on doors KIND OF THING WE CAN LITERALLY DO IT. BUT metaphorically.

192
00:19:52.770 --> 00:20:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But before you could have, you know, these are my skills. Maybe you want to open your own restaurant. I don't know what you want to do, but

193
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.720
Daniel Guerrero: Life and I talked about to, you know,

194
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.180
Daniel Guerrero: You know, how can we, how can we

195
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:14.820
Daniel Guerrero: Because I sort of a, you know, I would like to do, because I think if I was opening my own restaurant. I know I can shut this down, you know, not only him, you know,

196
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.230
Truck

197
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.690
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, that would be nice, you know,

198
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:34.410
Daniel Guerrero: Last time I talked to somebody who owned one was like $15,000, you know, that was just for the truck itself equipment. It was insane. And what the other equipment.

199
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:41.220
Daniel Guerrero: He didn't know. But that's all he wanted. He would have $15,000 for the food truck, you know,

200
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, hey, if we want this ideal thing. It's one version, but there's also compromised versions used this pulling pieces right now think people are selling things you could probably put it together on your own.

201
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not trying to give you advice. I'm just saying that

202
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Your time brainstorming on what's next.

203
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.190
Yeah, you

204
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.570
Daniel Guerrero: Know, I really appreciate that. But I mean it's it's dead serious stuff because

205
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.910
Daniel Guerrero: You know this is something that I think about when I when I go to bed, you know,

206
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.370
Daniel Guerrero: What am I going to do for

207
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.400
Daniel Guerrero: The next five years. What am I, where am I going to be in five years.

208
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.150
Daniel Guerrero: Where's my viet in five years, five years. I'm not be

209
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:39.330
Daniel Guerrero: In five years. I want to be able to own some vehicles that are dependable and five years going to be able to

210
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.420
Daniel Guerrero: Take care of my kids are in college, you know, and help them get through college, so that they can set up a career, you know,

211
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:55.710
Daniel Guerrero: These are the things I'm thinking about today, which I should have done about before I even started having kids, I should have thought, you know, if I see you and started messing up, but I mean, just for that, but

212
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.300
Daniel Guerrero: You know, these are things that frustrate me know these are things that I think about every day.

213
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel, it is going to likely feel better that each day you are investing in that five year plan if you're doing some small thing.

214
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That is an investment in that you already are, by not being in jail, you're already

215
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: investing in your future. So let's be honest, the fact that if you're not slinging anymore. That's an investment. So see always take pride in that. Okay.

216
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're available to them, you get to be around to give them advice about, you know,

217
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How to Treat a friend, how to do homework, how to eat, how to be in a family man. You're there to be a dad that's huge one of your biggest battles is going to be on a daily basis confronting that stuff about your past.

218
00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, giving into I should have woulda coulda and isn't going to serve you, it, it just won't

219
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you know that notion of how to what do I want to be doing five years from now and then just immediately. What am I doing, what can I, what can I do for five minutes. That's an investment in that future

220
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And my guess is what you're doing. If you had to be honest. How are you doing five minutes of investment in your future every single day.

221
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.690
Daniel Guerrero: I guess I'm not, you know, because you know I could I could be doing, you know,

222
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:41.490
Daniel Guerrero: You know, some positive, you know, maybe reaching out, you know, some different. Yeah, because there is there is job out there right there is other job opportunities out there.

223
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:52.590
Daniel Guerrero: But I don't know if those those resources are limited today because of, you know, they're so Cobra 19 thing that's going on. And I understand the risk, you know, because

224
00:23:54.450 --> 00:24:01.560
Daniel Guerrero: I would hate, I would hate you know to go out and bring that home and then expose that to my family or, you know,

225
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: As I

226
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:04.860
Daniel Guerrero: Understand the

227
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:15.000
Daniel Guerrero: Courses may be limited because of the because of those reasons, you know, there's some factories. They have closed down here in Clovis, you know, there are something like

228
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:21.270
Daniel Guerrero: There's other restaurants are closed down. You know, this business meatpacking company, you know,

229
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:33.240
Daniel Guerrero: Know what they do out here know killed that live cattle every day. No, no, they they chop it the packet. They mail it they send it

230
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:41.100
Daniel Guerrero: And that was something that I was interested in, and I did have a job interview with them and I went to it.

231
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.480
Daniel Guerrero: But it was when I first got out of prison. They told me

232
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:55.440
Daniel Guerrero: Like are you currently employed. I said no. I said, I just, you know, I didn't say that I had just got a prison right I said, No, I'm not. I'm not employed at the time.

233
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:03.300
Daniel Guerrero: We said, well, you need to go and get a job and hold that job for three months then come back and applying

234
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth, maybe

235
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This fear of losing the income that you have is so big.

236
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't want to sit with even those five minutes of

237
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to study for my GED know Joe, I need to get it done every day. I need to open up a book and be reviewing good but secret you're holding yourself back the truth of the matter is, this is a lot harder than you thought it would be.

238
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard something didn't land in your lap.

239
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but

240
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you would tell your daughters and your and your boys.

241
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What would, what would you tell me if I'm your donor and it didn't land in my lap. What would you tell me

242
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.460
Daniel Guerrero: I gotta keep pushing

243
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.420
You know, like

244
00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Push even when you are afraid I'm afraid to take that exam.

245
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I still have to show up. I'm going to be anxious and maybe I must throw up. But I'm gonna go

246
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna try and get at least to see my try again. D. I'll try and cast this class, you're going to show up. You're not gonna let Oh man, I completely forgot it was do my paper was do what you better write something and turn something in

247
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it wouldn't you do that when she said we'll get it done.

248
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.140
Daniel Guerrero: Yes, ma'am.

249
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But this fear is huge in your life. This was what was supposed to happen incrementally. You were robbed of that straight up, you did not have a family that gave you, small doses of this

250
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyday continue to add challenges where you had it only frustrated little frustrations not life or death.

251
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't get a chance to do that. So have compassion. It's happening now.

252
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're kind of like, like what's your kids right now. It's like, Dang, I've got to face my fear and fear. Fear has a lot of consequence. I'm a lover family down

253
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to, I want to bring this money in. But the fact of the matter is, you have a vision of what you want. And it's going to take

254
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: being uncomfortable for LM asking is five minutes a day where you sit with the discomfort. You can set a timer and sit with the fear, the discomfort of what if I'm not enough.

255
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: For five minutes a day. And if you can't do it for yourself do I'm gonna do it because I'm a represent for my kids, I'm asking them to do this, I'm going to represent

256
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you know I'm not minimizing how how hard a worker, you are you, I hope you know I'm definitely not saying that because you and I have record.

257
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I respect you.

258
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.910
Daniel Guerrero: Well, that wasn't even a thought.

259
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. So this I'm speaking some truth here. This is

260
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.800
Daniel Guerrero: This is

261
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What we do, this is how, when we're raising our kids. It's like no, man. I got you right here.

262
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard. Give it another five more minutes of thinking study it review it asked me some questions, sit with your frustration son, daughter, we believe in them when they don't believe in themselves. That's what parents do when we're little and you didn't have that

263
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It might just it, but unfortunately you're going to have to generate it yourself and you do not have that internal ego state structure in there so I'm doing it right now. I'm saying I believe in you.

264
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's going to be uncomfortable for those five minutes, and I've got a few of them in my own life. I'm like, Oh, I hate, not knowing what I'm doing.

265
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I hate it. I hate it and I, and so I tricked myself and I'm like, Okay, I'm not really going to do. I'm just going to open the website and

266
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a little tricks. I'm like, all I'm going to do is look at it and let me but then I'm like, well, actually I could do a little something there. Then I do a little something and then all of a sudden 20 minutes have passed so I tricked myself a little

267
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what this five minutes is five minutes is a trick because then you end up, you realize it's not as bad as you thought

268
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.880
Daniel Guerrero: Right you know a lot of my problem is man is is

269
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:31.590
Daniel Guerrero: Not a very good reader. I mean, I can eat, you know, but I have a hard time understanding like bigger ones. You know, I have to

270
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:40.230
Daniel Guerrero: What I do is I don't have to go to Google and type in the word to pronounce it for me. So I pronounce it, you know.

271
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.400
Daniel Guerrero: And then I tell

272
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:46.320
Daniel Guerrero: Me what the word means. It's always hard for me at times to grasp it.

273
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

274
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what

275
00:29:50.970 --> 00:30:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a growth mindset, though, that means it's just a matter of learning those words and i think i think you're

276
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're under estimating your comprehension of words, because I don't have to explain, actually a lot to you just even in our dialogue we tend to kind of know what I'm talking about. So, are you sure you know, is it. Are you saying that reading itself.

277
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is difficult

278
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.550
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know,

279
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.900
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if it's just because you know I've been told, you know,

280
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.730
Daniel Guerrero: You know, my whole life. You know, I just don't know.

281
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's what it is.

282
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.860
Daniel Guerrero: Or if it's just

283
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.740
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just, I don't know. You know, I don't know frustrates me because you know I

284
00:30:45.930 --> 00:31:00.030
Daniel Guerrero: I just wanted you know I made the wrong choice and and I can't take them back and I you know I know damn well today that you know if you don't have an education or if you don't have some kind of degree in something. Well, it's hard. It's hard to get a good paying job.

285
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:09.660
Daniel Guerrero: And then, you know, you know, I've got a jacket. You know that I wear every day that says spelling on it, you know, and

286
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.500
Daniel Guerrero: You know, that's another thing that's difficult for me.

287
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.420
Selling

288
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.130
Daniel Guerrero: I'm sorry.

289
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It says spelling

290
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like, what

291
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, man. That's funny. I was like, why are you wearing a jacket that says spelling you like spell. Give me a word to spell challenged me everybody was kind of cute like okay, that's one way to learn some words.

292
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, asked me to spell that that's gonna be that's

293
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What I thought, actually that's a darn good idea. How about you tell you that on your chest. Make me spell that first

294
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.230
Daniel Guerrero: Use it in a sentence.

295
00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god, that's funny. Okay, thank you. Zoom Telehealth for the comedy this morning.

296
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:01.560
Smelling

297
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Felon felon.

298
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Cute. Well, that's going to carry me all day long about laugh.

299
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um, let me just, I'm looking at something just to I really want to start to have a reality test with you. Okay.

300
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We just see from digital dear resident summertime purchase or some or life he deserves our party and pull usage rules bear repeating case remind them that

301
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.210
Please remind my fishes that they must obey the following rules.

302
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So question one, select the option that correctly completes itself.

303
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna be kind of fun. You want to do a little in vivo. I literally I only have a heads up on you by just like literally 10 seconds. Why do one more thing.

304
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

305
00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do a reality test because you have this judgment about yourself and I want to see if it's if it's true. So this is random. I just pick this thing is really random

306
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is a this is I just pulled this up free practice test for je je je reading practice tests. So the reasoning through language arts section.

307
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Includes sentence completion passages which test your grammar and language skills or practice questions or multiple choice, but on the actual test, you will use a drop down menu.

308
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Drop down is a little arrow, and then things you get to select from them to select the text which correctly, complete the sentence. So here we go. The passage below is incomplete.

309
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll see I just read it when you were here. You watch me do it didn't take me very long. So the past just flows incomplete for each question, choose the option that correctly completes the sentence. So down here for us this question one right here.

310
00:33:54.870 --> 00:34:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's a question down here. See, it's so it'll say, please. So it says select the option that complete correctly completes the sentence.

311
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to be we're either going to put a we're going to put be we're going to put see we're going to put d. Now, I have this thing that I do that before I start a video I look, I look at my questions. First of all, print out my quiz. When I'm doing a certification.

312
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Most professionals do we, I feel like it's a bit of a cheat.

313
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We print out our questions first. And as I'm listening to the video and I'm going to a training. I'm answering them as I go along.

314
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what I do. So first I read them and I say, Okay, these are some of my choices that are going to these are going to be my questions, it'll either be a

315
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So says please remember that that's part of this up here as summertime approaches and residents are more likely to have visitors are parking and pool usage rules. A bear repeating bear just means

316
00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important to repeat. So the word bear in here means important to repeat here goes. So watch keep this phrase in your mind. Please remember that. Okay, so please remember that. So I'm going to be, I'm going to have to remember something

317
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be my question, please remember that now is, am I about to read up here in this body of text.

318
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I supposed to remember that there are designated visitor parking in front of each apartment building in the complex or there's designated visitor parking in front of each apartment building.

319
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your designated visitor parking

320
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Are Oh there is, there are, there is designated

321
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. So they're focusing on grammar. It looks like. So there are. I see. So are is plural.

322
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Are refers to multiple things is is singular think that's what they're focusing on between these two sentences.

323
00:35:53.490 --> 00:36:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: There is designated visitor parking in front of each apartment building. There are designated visitor parking what that one's definitely wrong that was wack. There are designator visitor parking in front of each department K, that's just a mess. I like that one. Please remember that.

324
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, as summertime approaches and residents are more likely to have visitors or parking and pool usage rules require bear repeating require repeating please remember that.

325
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Please remind any visitor that they must obey the following rules if they are parking on our property park in designated visitor. So you parking designated

326
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know I'm going to do that. Cars may not be parked in visitor parking for more than 48 hours can't can't park more than 40 hours visitors are strictly prohibited from parking okay some visitors cannot park in residential parking spots.

327
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically, there's, you gotta park in the visitor parking. That's for real. Okay, there's there's will be towed if they don't do it the right way. Okay, so let me just go down here to one again please remember that.

328
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can figure out which one this is because I'm trying to figure it out myself.

329
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: There are designated visitor parking

330
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen.

331
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There is designated visitor parking in front of each of building. Is that true, did they talk about where it was.

332
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.700
Daniel Guerrero: They said it was in the front.

333
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Please remember you are. I see you so do to do. I'm right, and blah, blah, blah, blah, he typically boop boop boop, but do

334
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You said in front, really.

335
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You. Where is it, man.

336
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.450
Daniel Guerrero: In our parking and

337
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.790
Daniel Guerrero: Repeating

338
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.440
Daniel Guerrero: Oh no, it doesn't say

339
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't say where I think the key is

340
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They're focusing on, you definitely need a parking visitor spots.

341
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't know about the where I just see something like go back down my choices again so far I'm liking be so far. I'm like, and be the best there is, isn't there designated

342
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Parking in front of each apartment complex. Let me see. Oh, right. So, where it's located. Um, we just see if there's anywhere else.

343
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Park and designate a visitor, whereas it cars, maybe. Did you do

344
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:42.900
That

345
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Women, there is an overflow parking available visitor parking spots within the complex

346
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: More than two guys in the

347
00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Suit. I'm trying to figure out where the heck it is.

348
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:01.710
Yes.

349
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, listen, all of them say the same place. So we don't have to worry about that anymore. We're just going to assume it's in front of the apartment complex let's focus on grammar. Because look, here's our clue. What is this all about it says this whole thing up here.

350
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This includes sentence completion caches just which test does it test where the apartment complex know it's testing my grammar and language skill.

351
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I know they're trying to trick me up with the is and the are you see in here. We're oops, that's not the one I wanted. Oh, shoot. That just between you and I, that's not, I was just trying to select it.

352
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.090
Oh,

353
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually remember I was telling you, I thought it was be so anyway I got it right, I got it right.

354
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

355
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I all I was going to do is try and highlight this word is

356
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And and the are. That's where they were trying to trick you.

357
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, the whole point of this is we go back up. We look for our clues

358
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In our instruction. They're trying to trip me up in my grammar and my language. So I know it's not about really fact finding. It's more about how I'm going to get tripped up in grammar. So there are designated visitor parking. Does that sound right to you.

359
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, because this R is for plural, it would be better. It would have been correct grammar. Listen to this. There are designated visitor parking spaces.

360
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it would have worked Tom because spaces is plural. But visitor parking is a singular statement I I don't know how to teach language. I've just

361
00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I've learned over the years but I sure know when I hear it when it's wrong. And so what's really important is that I hear myself say it so I can test it. This was a tough one.

362
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.380
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I get it. You know, because

363
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:08.160
Daniel Guerrero: I get it, because like it just didn't make sense. But now that you read it right you know it makes sense now that you read it right and this is what I'm telling you know because

364
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Read this.

365
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you read, read, read the explanation.

366
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.060
Daniel Guerrero: Let me

367
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Open. I'm going to make it. Oh, I'm making it bigger. It's working. I'm making it bigger, bigger so better

368
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.140
Yeah.

369
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:32.460
Daniel Guerrero: It says answer be answer choice B is correct because they use the correct spelling of their

370
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I didn't even see that when we see

371
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So there was a wrong spelling all look at this there refers to a possessive person they tripped you up with that didn't even see that

372
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.700
Daniel Guerrero: I noticed that there was like there's, you know,

373
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.560
Daniel Guerrero: There.

374
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You caught it. Okay, keep going. So there, there's a clue right there. Keep going. So after there and keep going.

375
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.640
Daniel Guerrero: Correct form of the word to be

376
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.740
Daniel Guerrero: There is is referring

377
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see where they have to be have to be is the

378
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I think they mean is an R. I think that's what they're referring to is the R VS is

379
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.850
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

380
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah verb is phrases are so the correct form of the verb to be, which means we are alive. We is they

381
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.040
Bear.

382
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.050
Daniel Guerrero: I guess in a sentence.

383
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:45.090
Daniel Guerrero: There is referring to the location of visitors visitor parking and the apartment complex. The word

384
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.470
Daniel Guerrero: There is a

385
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:53.280
Daniel Guerrero: possessive pronoun. I didn't see I don't even know what those mean

386
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't either. You don't have to just keep on I don't either.

387
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:03.600
Daniel Guerrero: Going and and those and does not fit the sentence, the

388
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

389
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.590
Daniel Guerrero: This you

390
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:13.230
Daniel Guerrero: Eliminate. Eliminate answer choice B. C.

391
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what they're saying is the there which you saw this thing when it speaks to

392
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: A possessive. That's their toy. Now it is over there, you knew that you may not have known the

393
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Language

394
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That grammatical way I don't either. That's why I'm not a language teacher. I can't, I can't, I don't know how to describe it either.

395
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:40.380
Daniel Guerrero: So possessive kind of sounds like like possession. Like there's

396
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This one.

397
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yes.

398
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:46.290
Daniel Guerrero: There's like somebody that possesses something or

399
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And the pronoun is is that they're

400
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So possessive means it's theirs. It's their toy. You're not pointing to the location. This one is location.

401
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Th care. And so, look what they did, they're giving you clues you know it's not C or D choices.

402
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they screwed up the word there so you could already eliminate that one you right here, you caught that. Didn't you you knew it when you saw this walk a new thing. And I didn't even pick up on that you picked up on.

403
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:24.180
Daniel Guerrero: Right, okay. It says this is the correct form.

404
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:42.330
Daniel Guerrero: This is the correct form of the word of the verb to be in the sentence because the verb is referring to one parking area. It needs to be a singular verb. This eliminates the answers, a nd

405
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So the word is he was highlighted.

406
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.290
Daniel Guerrero: This no yeah

407
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the correct form of the verb to be, to be or not to be. It's a very likely either alive. We are. We aren't that's what they're speaking to, in the sense, because the verb is referring to one.

408
00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: parking area. So it needs to be a singular verb number up here. I was saying something's wack about our versus is this one was off and then you heard me say it out loud, and then you knew for sure it in you.

409
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: did wrong.

410
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys know when we say a word out loud. If we say a sentence out loud. We're going to, we may not know how we may not know our fancy present participle all that nonsense, but you're going to know it when you hear it.

411
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you say it out loud.

412
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when you're sitting in a test you can do those are designated parking

413
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: There are designated visitor parking their designated No that's stupid. That sounds stupid.

414
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: There is designated visitor parking parking is one unit. It's a one thing in front of each yeah baby. That's it. And we got the right there. I bet you would have picked this. Okay, so we just did an activity. I bet you weren't expecting that today where you

415
00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.850
Daniel Guerrero: Know you know it's good lesson, you know,

416
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what did you notice about yourself.

417
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.240
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah, well I guess I'm not really all that often what I thought, you know,

418
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No you're not.

419
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

420
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have a master's degree.

421
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.810
Daniel Guerrero: That's, that's kind of cool. You know, I really appreciate you.

422
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.360
Daniel Guerrero: Know what I can do.

423
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was thrown at you like, like fat you didn't. You didn't have time to really slow down. You didn't have time to really even know, get yourself mindset around. What are we going to do

424
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You picked up on the there.

425
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You pick up on this, this the whole structure was completely foreign to you and I throw it at you and you were brilliant

426
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wanted to end. And did I know that about you too, we ever done that before. No, but I knew that just from listening.

427
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: To the range of vocabulary words you have one thing that you do that if you ever want me to point it out, that would benefit from a switch in the way you say something that might trip you up and I can do that if you if you tell me you want it.

428
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do I think with a past tense present tense thing that might, it might be useful to you in an endeavor like this in a goal.

429
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But the reality. Daniel is you have come across this way with a wide vocabulary range very articulate way of speaking since the day I met you, you have had this this is this is you. You're an intelligent capable, man.

430
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.570
Daniel Guerrero: We know

431
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.220
Daniel Guerrero: I really appreciate them. I just didn't, you know, I

432
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:02.640
Daniel Guerrero: Know I heard different words every day. I have people using different vocabulary every day, you know, and it's just like

433
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.180
Daniel Guerrero: Now I come, I come. I don't know how to talk like that, you know,

434
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.540
Daniel Guerrero: I go I don't have those books March, you know,

435
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:14.310
Daniel Guerrero: And I, you know, it's kind of frustrating to me because I just feel like that.

436
00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.170
Daniel Guerrero: You know, my parents didn't give me the right opportunity, you know,

437
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:31.230
Daniel Guerrero: And it's and I try to make sure that my kids have that opportunity. You know, make sure that they make sure that they even though their home being homeschooled. And I don't even know.

438
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know, my daughter is in kindergarten and they're teaching her place value and they're teaching her whole numbers, already you know

439
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:48.690
Daniel Guerrero: hazing. What is that, you know, my, my other daughter, she's you know. She's a, she's a second grade and we're already doing long division know it's like wow you know

440
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How can that be so yeah, so are you judging yourself negatively, because you don't know how to do what a second graders doing

441
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.470
Daniel Guerrero: No, I just, I'm just like,

442
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.580
Daniel Guerrero: Judging myself, mainly because like

443
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:12.960
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I had, I had a hard time learning in school and I was embarrassed by it. So when a teacher said. Does everybody understand. Yeah, you know,

444
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so sorry.

445
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.490
Daniel Guerrero: So it was just like

446
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:26.730
Daniel Guerrero: So when it came time to do tests and stuff instead of the, you know, teacher coming to me and be like hey Danny, do you really understand because according to your

447
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:37.020
Daniel Guerrero: You know great john understanding what's going on. Do I need to sit down with you. I didn't get that opportunity. You know, or if I would have seen that in a student. I'm a bit a

448
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.440
Daniel Guerrero: I need you to stay after class and you know visit with you.

449
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:43.920
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because that's your job.

450
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: Or his job as a teacher is to make sure that you're

451
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.610
Daniel Guerrero: You're learning

452
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:54.570
Daniel Guerrero: And I didn't have that, you know, I hadn't had a math teacher that was just like she was just horrible.

453
00:49:55.530 --> 00:50:08.520
Daniel Guerrero: Now that I can remember her. I remember her, you know, and she was just like she was the most worst teacher I've ever met in my life. Because if you didn't get it, she explained, and she explained it so fast it confused me

454
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:14.820
Daniel Guerrero: And it's like, All right, we're moving on. I'm like, Okay, you know, so

455
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.720
Daniel Guerrero: For me it was difficult, you know, but then

456
00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What what happened in here. That was not what that math class was like what happened in here between us. It was not a parallel if it didn't, if we didn't do what had happened to you before. What did you and I do that is not the same as the way school was

457
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.770
Daniel Guerrero: Um, we looked we research. The problem together, you know,

458
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I do, what do you, what did you hear me doing even as this person that has power right and authority and blah, blah, blah. I got more education. WHAT DID I DO WHAT DID YOU HEAR ME DO

459
00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:07.740
Daniel Guerrero: You know, we read, we read the read everything we went over everything together. And so for like for me that was, that was great but

460
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.470
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. No, I don't know what answer you're looking for. I'm sorry.

461
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry.

462
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. I said, I don't know either.

463
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I accidentally press the wrong button.

464
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what a possessive pronoun is

465
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I humble.

466
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:33.180
Daniel Guerrero: That's cool.

467
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I imagine it feels better to be around someone who isn't better than you act like they're better than you. It's a really unpleasant feeling to be around someone when they think they're better than you. It's awful.

468
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.990
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, they go. So, you know,

469
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

470
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I don't happen to think I'm better than anybody, it's just whatever. Here I am, you know,

471
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think I better say I lucked out, you know, I didn't focus very hard and undergrad.

472
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I sure to graduate school serious

473
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is truly

474
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It. There's no special code. There's no special club that I'm in

475
00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I might have had this opportunity this opportunity and this opportunity that you didn't have. But it doesn't mean you can't have the same outcome.

476
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You could literally have more education than me and be further along than me. I'm not the reference standards success, but I'm here and we're talking. But my point is

477
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to need to believe in yourself.

478
00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though every experience you had all these messages of

479
00:52:56.190 --> 00:53:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not smart enough, you can't do it, and all that a fair assessment of school setting, it's awful to be in a classroom and

480
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And not know what how to do something. It's awful. It really sticks with people for a long time. So don't be surprised that that feeling of I don't want to not know it's awful. It's

481
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It might keep you from doing things you want to do. But that's normal. It's common and but it's not the end of the story.

482
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what the recipe that you may need is to remember that was then

483
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If I, if I make decisions based on preventing embarrassment and right looking like a fool. I'm not going to get what I want in life you are not nine years old anymore.

484
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tolerate someone thinking you're a fool. Hold on to that.

485
00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it. The worst thing that can happen if someone thinks

486
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't know how to do this well who cares what I think it's some guy some teacher who cares. You have so many people in your life. All this love. These are the people

487
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That believe in you, your children, believe in your wife leaves you, I believe in you, and I'm sure there's more support out there. If you look, we believe in you.

488
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Care about what we think not about the idiots. Turn them out. Yeah. No. Should I want to take it again. I want to work on that. Hey. Catch Me If You see me doing that same thing again.

489
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Not I'm an idiot. And I can't do it. That's the old. That's it. That's a nine year old. That's a 10 year olds self appraisal and identity and belief in the self you

490
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can say, Man, I can't believe I didn't remember it. I've ever put some stickies up. I better tell my kids quiz me on this all week long.

491
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me what the grammar is for that. I'm not kidding, it's funny. But what if it's true, that'd be funny spelling

492
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Spelling back

493
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.380
Daniel Guerrero: Dissonance

494
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Use it or what's the grammatical present participle possessive pronoun, what the heck's

495
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have humility, Daniel.

496
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Limitless it's limitless, but you get stuck in. I've got this felony on my back and I'm always going to be like this and people are always going to see me like that.

497
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see like that. So there's an exception to the rule. I don't see you as a felon. I met you. And I was like, look at that. That guy knows how to articulate what's going on inside of him.

498
00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if you the biggest key here is you keep that vision of what you want.

499
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you are humble.

500
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can't possibly know

501
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: When you haven't learned

502
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't know what you haven't learned

503
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your parents did the best they could, they did a crappy job. By the way, but

504
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: They did the best they could, because if we if we get hung up on any other story we start getting angry, resentful, we

505
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We spend all our time being angry at those parents and all that for now. I would say, Let's not let it SAP all your energy. It's going to be today. How can I use this strength of humility to learn what I didn't learn when I was a kid.

506
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it's

507
00:56:51.450 --> 00:57:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: These are my 10 words, your family, get your family involved. Make sure you use them in a sense and and make me get these darn things. And here's the here's the way to sick, so just now can I point something out. You did that was kind of whack.

508
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to pointed out to you.

509
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.020
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, please.

510
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you said the most worst

511
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know you're laughing. So, you know, something must have been asked with it right

512
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.040
Daniel Guerrero: So funny.

513
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But why are you laughing. Do you know what's off about that.

514
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.980
Daniel Guerrero: It just doesn't sound right. You know, it's

515
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

516
00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you just dropped the most now now say it.

517
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.980
Daniel Guerrero: Worse. Yeah.

518
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No worst

519
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The worst thing about that crummy childhood was a missed opportunity. The worst thing about this meal is the okra.

520
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The most worst

521
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See, once you guys notice how once you heard it. You see what a skill that is when you know that you're an auditory learner.

522
00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you, you got to hear it. You got to hear it. Everybody's got a different channel of learning. Some people are visual. Some are auditory, some are kinesthetic, they've got to actually like do it moves the words around.

523
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you knowing that you're an auditory learner, you'd be talking to the people say that out loud and then sound right. And then now. Okay, now I got it.

524
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:34.800
Daniel Guerrero: All right.

525
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The most worst teacher

526
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: She was the worst teacher or if you have to. If you're in love with this word most

527
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If you just gotta have it.

528
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if there's a way to do it, how would I do it if I had to use that word to say you got to use the word most in this next sentence.

529
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You are the most

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.130
Daniel Guerrero: Right, I get it.

535
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how to describe to you the grammar of it, but I sure know when it sounds wrong.

536
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.400
Daniel Guerrero: It's there. I hear it, you know. Okay.

537
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:27.630

542
00:59:48.660 --> 01:00:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Bunch soaking it up, but it's going to need to be said, you're going to need to hear it out loud, you're going to need to hear it because that's how you learn. You have a style and it's auditory

543
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.400
Daniel Guerrero: Alright.

544
01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.260

552
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:42.240
Daniel Guerrero: Is, you know, quite an experience. You know, I really enjoyed it. Because you know there's some things that I want to do is open them, you know, open that window, you know, because I need it most definitely

553
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:43.770
Daniel Guerrero: Most again.

554
01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but you can use it by itself. That's fine. Or you may want to think about. I'm going to, well, I gotta go. My next clients here, but think about an app on your phone or on a computer or something is called Xcel learning

555
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I use it like if I can't figure out how to help one of my kids like how to do math. I'm like, I don't know. So I go on there and like get the answer wrong intentionally and then it shows me how to do it, kind of like that blue section just did.

556
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It shows me if

557
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You look at the x axis, you look at the Y axis and then you divide it by this and you know it's this acute angle and blah, blah, blah. All and then it all comes back and like, oh yeah, I remember on there. Then I school

558
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And but guess what I have humility. Can't do it. Can't do it. If I think I look stupid. If I don't already know. And yes, I have to put up with my kid making fun of me, but I don't care, I make fun all the time. So,
