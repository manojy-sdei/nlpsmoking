00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.430
Nicole Bacon: So I'm kind of under covers cuz I'm I can't get warm today. So kind of weird like

2
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.460
Nicole Bacon: Getting a cold, a little bit.

3
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So someone told me that, um, it's really cold out there like below four or something insane.

4
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.550
Nicole Bacon: It's pretty cold. It's the little sunny today, but yeah.

5
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right clouds aren't keeping the heat and it's just burn right

6
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

7
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're also gonna sing a little bit of some runny nose, and some cold symptoms.

8
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.450
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, a little bit. Okay.

9
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk a little bit about

10
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: where we left off, got on the phone, there was sort of this. Oh my gosh moment. And where did that leave you between that call. And now what have you been going through

11
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.120
Nicole Bacon: I freaked out for a little bit and I'm like,

12
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:12.120
Nicole Bacon: Thinking. Well, I guess I'll go do that other program that my probation officer mentioned, but I really didn't want to. So I'm glad you got back to me.

13
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.690
Nicole Bacon: So,

14
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.890
Nicole Bacon: I went to visit a friend and talked about it a little bit and

15
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:41.820
Nicole Bacon: Man, I've just been here at the house, taking care of the animals. My parents are, how are out of town again. So I'm sitting, I took I bring my bed kitty with me time okay felt bad about leaving her for three links. Yeah.

16
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long have you been already awake.

17
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.610
Nicole Bacon: So I woke up.

18
00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:05.550
Nicole Bacon: At 930 cuz my mom wanted me to take my grandma to go do some blood tests and I call my grandma and she's like, Oh no, my heat there. I can't get it. I could do it myself and my okay so I

19
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.500
Nicole Bacon: Went back to bed. I had a hard time sleeping. I didn't sleep till late

20
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.210
Okay.

21
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about

22
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharing with your friend. Tell me about the friend.

23
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.830
Nicole Bacon: So I actually talked to Shannon okay and

24
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.780
Nicole Bacon: Told her

25
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.990
Nicole Bacon: You know I made this commitment and this contract and

26
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.550
Nicole Bacon: Felt like guy was like on my last

27
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.610
Nicole Bacon: Opportunity there and

28
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.810
Nicole Bacon: First, I called her, you know, and then I went over later to talk to you more about it.

29
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: She's your wife figure right

30
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

31
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, she's the one that's like, well, have you taken inventory of

32
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.400
Nicole Bacon: Everything you've done. Yeah.

33
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the feedback you got from her.

34
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.500
Nicole Bacon: Just to, you know, we'll do what you need to do to have your medication and and

35
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:40.200
Nicole Bacon: KEEP GOING WITH your therapy, you know, don't let it mess you up, you know, it always I can always call her. Okay, so she's been opening back up to me a little bit.

36
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about your initial assessment of this sort of judgment piece that was there before. What are you noticing about how you're maybe open to her.

37
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980
Nicole Bacon: Just being vulnerable and accepting

38
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.110
Nicole Bacon: Instead of

39
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.230
Nicole Bacon: Being hostile towards her like

40
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.350
Nicole Bacon: Like feeling like yes she wants to drill it in me that I'm a fuck up instead of that more just

41
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:24.720
Nicole Bacon: We know printer and being like, well, yeah, this person cares about me immensely and always has and she just wants the best for me and

42
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:34.110
Nicole Bacon: I'm gonna hear it from her straight always and when I don't want to hear straight, then that's the issue.

43
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.270
Okay.

44
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe wrap yourself around your blanket. But let's do try to have a therapeutic environment. See if you can get me.

45
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm in front of you, versus kind of up your nose.

46
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.640
Sorry.

47
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time.

48
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Still pretty low. Let's get one that it's literally you know where you and I are i'd i

49
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that that part's pretty important. That's a lot better. That's getting

50
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.170
Nicole Bacon: So good.

51
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta be able to stay there.

52
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Fantastic. Nicely done.

53
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

54
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What I mentioned was that we would spend a little bit of time deconstructing what worked, what didn't work and

55
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Assuming just human. We sleep. We're, we're overtired, things like that. I get all of that. But why don't we look at at today so I your appointment was right on the hour and I was checking in and what I don't know is how long it takes. People like to be in that queue.

56
00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But

57
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How long did you give yourself to actually because really what bright heart health actually wants is you guys check in a half hour before your session.

58
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can see why that would be the case when there's a whole bunch of people checking in. For group right

59
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.890
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

60
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, sometimes I see people at six in the morning and I don't really need them to be there. A half hour before there's not going to be anybody there but for you. You might want to be considering

61
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot. There's a lot at stake, I might have to do a Bam. What if they tell me to do a drug screen. What if I there's some weird random new survey, they come up with that they want to throw at you.

62
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there's right this travel time I used to call it. I used to live in California and I would give myself a lead time of two hours.

63
00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that might seem insane certainly is out here in Florida. They were like, how is that a thing out here. It's a half hour I give myself like this little window for traffic is like compared to LA. This is like there's no traffic.

64
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.200
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

65
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't exist like that people just slowed down, whatever. So, um,

66
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this thing that was there this appointment or whatever it was, wasn't going to move. They don't care.

67
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta change it.

68
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:33.600
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's usually a lot of times, and I'm about to text you and then they answer within a couple minutes, but I do need to just

69
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:47.880
Nicole Bacon: If our appointments at one, I need to just put it down at 1245 again like I did do that for one week and I think it was helping and I stopped doing that for some reason, I need to go back to doing that.

70
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to

71
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.920
Nicole Bacon: Your demon before just yeah

72
00:08:53.250 --> 00:09:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's more than just check in, don't you want to wash your face, brush your teeth hydrate. Don't you want the self care ritual to. Don't you want to also be ready because

73
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot that could go on and here

74
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.400
I

75
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, let's start with what normally we do at the end we'll start it in the front. This time, and will actually schedule stuff because right there was a lot that happened. We got really protective

76
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do we already have.

77
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We already have we're already here.

78
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We have tomorrow at noon.

79
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Which translates to

80
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.350
Nicole Bacon: Live in 35 okay

81
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got to 27 1135 now I'm writing it down. So I'm going to be asking you to go put that in your phone even log out if you have to. That's home for this is

82
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

83
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure you want to write it down. It's up to you.

84
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.670
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I have it in my phone, but I'll change the time

85
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.710
Nicole Bacon: And Jenny.

86
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to 28 at right you'll change it maybe to 1145 or 11th sorry 35

87
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:20.880
Nicole Bacon: And then

88
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to write in there because you may forget what it is because it's a weird date, but it's group. It's actually a 12pm group.

89
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: 1135 that's giving you extra that 10 MINUTES TO CHECK IN WITH wash face hydrate. If there's coffee that you drink whatever's going on.

90
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You get that self care part

91
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.820
Nicole Bacon: Group at noon I will put it

92
00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.940
Nicole Bacon: In 35

93
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then set march 3

94
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: At same thing

95
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:14.100
Nicole Bacon: Maybe 1135 3035 yeah

96
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I've gotta check and see when we sign this contract.

97
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.960
Probably still see it. I'm you say

98
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she won 29 so

99
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say BY ABOUT THAT DAY OF MARCH 3 as far as I'm concerned, this there was a little blip here, but you've been working really hard to show these appointments, you're working hard in the

100
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Same group.

101
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

102
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to ask you, when you get to march 3

103
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at your goals. Let's take a look and see if we want to stay at twice a week or we can go to, once a week. Okay.

104
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now

105
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I have been very on purpose being very gentle very careful getting all of this sort of preparation stuff done, while at the same time watching right this sort of the

106
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Foot to but piece, which has to do with just regular old show up for what you committed to that accountability part which

107
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an important part, but it's not the same thing as an experiential therapeutic exercise.

108
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: They can be happening at the same time. And we're doing that we're doing the foot to buck piece. Now we're talking about. Okay, what do I say I'm going to do, I'm going to make sure I protect that time but

109
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Haven't done any of the the therapeutic exercises.

110
00:12:59.280 --> 00:12:59.820
And

111
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's check in, again, on March 3 and see, see how you feel about it. So what I want to do is I'm going to hold a spot just for that week.

112
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For 12 on March 5 which would mean you would have this last week of twice a week that's already set

113
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then if we're sitting here on on the third saying this is just ridiculous. I mean, you don't need this. I mean, this is to intensive. I don't think that's what we're going to end up saying, but

114
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.720
Nicole Bacon: You know,

115
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It was my assessment that I thought you needed an IoT anyway.

116
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So anyway there, right there. So go ahead and put in your phone if you could 1135 for March 3

117
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Party tactic. And then same time 1135

118
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: For march 5

119
00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I've got

120
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got you in there and also keep in mind.

121
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll be some little wiggling around on my part.

122
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: In

123
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: April, just I think it's the first week of April. Yeah.

124
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.020
Nicole Bacon: We're doing around good going around.

125
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, meaning, I'll be flying actually

126
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of state doesn't mean I can't meet with people, but it probably does mean I can't meet with people.

127
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.930
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah.

128
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.820
Nicole Bacon: Because vacation.

129
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I know I had some actually doing a training on in the Bainbridge Island and in Seattle area. Thank you, kind of may know a little bit about area right

130
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.020
Nicole Bacon: So bit

131
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: About and so yeah I'll be up there so long flight.

132
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The hook I pick a further place to fly to

133
00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.710
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

134
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.500
Nicole Bacon: Usually over

135
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So what kind of keep that in mind so good that we're doing all this stuff settling in. Now because there might be a little, a little wrinkle.

136
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

137
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So just kind of go inside now kind of check in here and see is there anxiety is there apprehension. Is there a belief about yourself about me about us about our treatment, just check in and see what emerges. What's got lots of

138
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of energy around it.

139
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be none of the above.

140
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:54.720
Nicole Bacon: But look, yeah I ok so this morning. Since my mom told me to take my grandma and my grandma said no.

141
00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:13.050
Nicole Bacon: Now my moms like well how's mama. And I told her I would go by later. But I want to feel better. So I'm going to take like black elderberry there's something to help me feel a little bit better. So I can go over there because I don't want to lie to her, you know,

142
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.880
Nicole Bacon: And she's fees, a camera. Anyways, so it's like my grandma put me in a weird position.

143
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what I don't get. There was no need, right. Somehow she was going to make it on our own.

144
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:37.710
Nicole Bacon: That's the thing though my when my mom's here. She's, she's like Oh, help me with everything. I can't do anything.

145
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.050
Nicole Bacon: And then the same thing.

146
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:47.460
Nicole Bacon: I call her and she's like, Oh no, they have me. You don't have to take me. Just tell your mom that you took me. I'm like,

147
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, no, no, no.

148
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

149
00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:00.450
Nicole Bacon: I don't like that. So I said I would go see her later. Anyways, after this appointment.

150
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So something's coming up. So is this the this is maternal grandmother. This is your mom's mother. It's the same woman that sort of has this that storyline about sort of how the skin looks

151
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.950
Nicole Bacon: Natalie, I want

152
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.750
Nicole Bacon: Okay. Yes. Yeah.

153
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so that's it. Now I see what you mean by put me in a weird position.

154
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.290
Yeah.

155
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:42.330
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and that's why I'm like, I haven't gotten ready and stuff because I'm like, Okay, I have to do all this, put the makeup on. It's a big ordeal for me to go here.

156
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right.

157
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.500
Nicole Bacon: Man Yeah, okay.

158
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this actually sounds very familiar to show the last time we had, and you actually have it in real time.

159
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.640
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

160
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:02.130
Nicole Bacon: So I guess when like when I when I'm not feeling like really good and I just like

161
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.650
Nicole Bacon: Woke up for our appointment.

162
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.510
Nicole Bacon: I haven't watched my face and stuff. And I am sorry.

163
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's an interesting and very odd apology.

164
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. So I'm okay. It's the wash face.

165
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's interesting.

166
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.710
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I'm more inclined, but I feel like I can be real with you and

167
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.980
Nicole Bacon: Like not judgmental and said let's

168
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me make sure I correct that that

169
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.620
Nicole Bacon: Washes or

170
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me insert something else. I wish I had said.

171
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Splash cold water on your face to wake up. I wish I said that

172
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.340
Nicole Bacon: Okay, okay.

173
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

174
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.040
Nicole Bacon: No, I see.

175
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I see what you did with that and I apologize. Um, yeah, I wish I would have chosen my words better

176
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:02.370
Nicole Bacon: It's this weird. The New Mexican family society thing of like

177
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:11.610
Nicole Bacon: Make it all look good all the time, no matter if it's good or not. Let's not talk about it out of law right

178
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I've got

179
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got, I've got some makeup is just, they're so heavy. These days, lots and lots of makeup. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. That's really neat that you said that directly to me. That's cool.

180
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to directly. Talk to me. Even though let's you know i know you took the route of apology, but

181
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But she called in. He kept talking and you held on to yourself there and how did it turn out, we actually, we talked about and got some clarification.

182
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.000
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I know that the

183
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.100
Nicole Bacon: just realizing it's just some very deep.

184
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.090
Nicole Bacon: Vanity just like

185
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.120
Nicole Bacon: Deep family vanity issues men, but

186
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It, but it's also proximal. It's also not gone it's still right there and you just got a dose of it this morning, or I think it was this morning. Right. Yeah. Because there's that conflict, you're presented with a conundrum, which do i do i don't i'm not a liar.

187
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And

188
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to show you respect. Oh.

189
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:45.900
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, a lot of like put in a position of what I don't want to be doing in like monkey in the middle type of

190
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.510
Nicole Bacon: Deals yeah like in the middle. Yeah.

191
00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Long term will be if you want to write those got a few you guys in there. And these sort of paradoxical relationships. Right. You remember we touched on it you benefiting from support financially, maybe, and some some pieces of it continue the

192
00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Dependence part but there's a cost.

193
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. To your psyche

194
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If you believe in the soul to the soul.

195
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

196
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: First is, can you sit with that. Can you can, can we agree on terms that that might be happening that you're, you're really looking at it and

197
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to go crazy for it.

198
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.360
But

199
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one of the options. That's what these types of people kind of do you can either go crazy or you can get high.

200
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Good run away.

201
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:55.800
Right.

202
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you

203
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be defining

204
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And defiance is an interesting word defiance can show up in different ways.

205
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: defiance doesn't have to be spraying on the walls. And then, you know, screw you, and pulling your pants down or something weird like, no, no.

206
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Not that big. I'm sorry.

207
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.050
Nicole Bacon: A little strange.

208
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: popped into my head so

209
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So defiance can be our own private little inner smile. You know, like

210
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

211
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a firm no on that one, right.

212
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.560
That

213
00:22:44.820 --> 00:23:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That private space that we decide who touches it was access to it right where our soul is in our psyche and boundary. And that's a firm. No, we don't have to say it because it probably won't be heard, the way you want it to with her.

214
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.460
Nicole Bacon: Right, yeah.

215
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you brought that up. I asked you kind of what's coming up. This is coming up again, you're in, you're in it.

216
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think let's keep talking about it. Let's keep moving through this

217
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.220
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and definitely with her. I

218
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.970
Nicole Bacon: I would have to

219
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.120
Nicole Bacon: Take a long time and get really high to go over to see her honestly

220
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: For goodness sake.

221
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:34.290
Yeah.

222
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.000
Nicole Bacon: Cuz she's like, I get there and she's like, she's okay for a little bit. And she's like,

223
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.240
Nicole Bacon: I'm ready to die.

224
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

225
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. Can we have a Segway, please.

226
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Read position something in between hours. You want to die.

227
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:07.620
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah no her house. She goes there pretty quick. Mmm, it's hard to try to keep that

228
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.290
Nicole Bacon: Please don't go there.

229
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

230
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So Nicole use you have choice there too. So this is just one other person's perspective and we're not going into the content with the makeup, which we could. It's pretty relevant, but let's go to this one for a second. So I've worked with

231
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: People that have skipped so affective disorder. Right. So it's a it's an organic brain dis ease. It's not family systems. Some although you can see some symptoms that are similar, but this is very much an organic etiology.

232
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: For them, those voices those relationships, those tactics are real.

233
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So what am I going to do try and convince them. They're not real.

234
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to learn more about it. I'm going to share my own experience of having my reality not heard by other people.

235
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And how it can feel hopeless. I can do that. I can meet them there because our relationship is important. It's also important, even with somebody else can. So 20 hours so effective disorder that I said turn with them, they're

236
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Not fight it not be in conflict.

237
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.100
Nicole Bacon: Right.

238
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If your Nana or mom or whatever you call it. Her these days, right, you

239
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: May want to die, you know, and I'm going to say, me too, sometimes.

240
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you what this life is friggin hard, tell me why you want to die. Now, that's me, right.

241
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It you have, haven't you,

242
00:25:54.390 --> 00:26:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You actually can find that place with her without feeling it for her. You can sit with your own and say, I can you got this cookie superficial way about you.

243
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandma. But that actually, I felt something like that where I thought I just, this is just, I'm done.

244
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what she would say,

245
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.670
Nicole Bacon: Oh gosh, you know what, and like I haven't thought of my grandma like

246
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.660
Nicole Bacon: It more of those type of skin so issues because I had to accept.

247
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:55.140
Nicole Bacon: Was schizo for two years and I never knew a few was telling the truth or being real or not, but in the moment. That's very real for them. That's what's happening. And I guess I like separated the two like like it's not in the family or something. And yeah, it is.

248
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not trying to allude

249
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That anyone your family has has

250
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.010
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, but no issue.

251
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.020
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

252
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But my the actual point has to do with

253
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.440
Nicole Bacon: Two meter.

254
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Meter there if you're curious because typically you in order for you to survive in your family environment. You've needed to see the danger and risk involved in all these these things like this thing with the makeup and

255
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's dangerous and you perceive threat. So of course right you I don't want to go.

256
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to get high.

257
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Or someone to feel the danger. I don't want to feel it's awful.

258
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:50.940
Nicole Bacon: But you can. That's not an option anymore. So I have to meet things meet mean it where it's at. Instead of because it makes me feel even more uncomfortable been backing away.

259
00:27:51.510 --> 00:28:03.060
Nicole Bacon: In my body and being like, well, that's yours, not mine. I feel overwhelmed by that but I you know I feel stronger now that I don't have to do that.

260
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it is true, it is hers, not yours. Let's true but this one is really complicated.

261
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.310
Nicole Bacon: This one has

262
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: extra layers of fun so

263
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

264
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can go any which way you want to. With this

265
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But just keep in mind. They're just skills. All you're going to do is you're going to use some skills, you might forget some skills, you are not at stake.

266
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Your love ability, your perfection as a human being, which means you're flawed. Just like me and everybody else is not at stake. That's intact.

267
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:43.740
Okay.

268
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do you think back a little bit about what we did last time kind of visit that in your memory if you can remember any of it at all like

269
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:53.820
Nicole Bacon: This

270
00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: role play thing with the makeup and just felt like if I had access to being able to just be like, what is that

271
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And being curious. So there's that kind of way of being.

272
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And this other word I threw out, which is this inner defiance. This little

273
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I will not betray myself.

274
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.810
Nicole Bacon: I i've got a little taste of that a couple days ago.

275
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.730
Nicole Bacon: Talking to what I call her my boss. I mean, I

276
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.420
Nicole Bacon: I gave her my booth rent at the salon, but she got on the phone with me for like

277
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:45.420
Nicole Bacon: A very long time talking to me about a client and if she was in the rate talking to her about all this stuff and

278
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:55.680
Nicole Bacon: I'm like scarlet, honestly, you're going to just have to be like I did the best I could do, and he he laughing. I'll have

279
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:14.790
Nicole Bacon: LAUGH LAUGH Because I know I got I I'm strong in my communication skills with that person. You know, and so it is. I honestly used to live life a lot like that. Like all the time before

280
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what bring you up to speed, where we're at in your fan.

281
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.900
Nicole Bacon: Of like this little like

282
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:34.020
Nicole Bacon: Defiant like he like playful thing of like, okay, I'm looking at the situation from a different perspective. Instead of like getting caught in the mushy or the the

283
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:42.480
Nicole Bacon: Fear or the lower vibrational stuff that

284
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You could stay in the same room, but sort of still have a distance. IT WASN'T AFFECTING YOU somehow

285
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.280
Nicole Bacon: Right, yeah.

286
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you weren't. Hi, you were able to to notice that that that's

287
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, actual okay so you recognize this.

288
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So now let's just see what happens.

289
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When I write, notice what you say back to me where that defiance lives, maybe in your body, or what its battle cry is right, what the flag of Dave will not move from here, I will not be moved from this position. This is my truth.

290
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: See what comes up for you. Let's do a little bit of that role playing again.

291
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.400
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

292
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I say

293
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I, I, something's different about she didn't put makeup on what's going on with your face. Why aren't you wearing makeup. Don't you care about how you look, you know, that's like a sign of self esteem. What do you

294
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing, I don't, I don't want it. Would you don't respect me not going to put makeup on. Why don't you do that I taught you better than that.

295
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:17.820
Nicole Bacon: Well, it's a it's a personal thing for me to heal my skin. And every time I put makeup on it. It makes it worse gamma. So, in the long run. Um, I want to look good. So this is the weird in between of

296
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.650
Nicole Bacon: awkwardness.

297
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.230
Nicole Bacon: I don't have to look at if you don't want to do

298
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.360
Nicole Bacon: Okay, good talk like this.

299
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.680
Nicole Bacon: Okay, what's

300
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You did great. You found your giggle but you did something where you're still hooked and it has to do with you addressed my content. You were lost. As soon as she caught the content.

301
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you have a choice. You can go there. Yeah, that was amazing. If you liked it, but you were defending yourself.

302
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I was threatening.

303
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.640
Nicole Bacon: You with content.

304
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, but then she may have a better one. She's good at this. She's probably better than all of us at sparring.

305
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: She's really she's got this denial. This like superficial thing down. Okay, she's good at it. She's better than me. She's gonna win.

306
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think I want to play her game.

307
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to play a different one.

308
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of get off off center, a little bit.

309
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Remember that that word I used last time, which had to do with curiosity had to do. Notice how he didn't you went to logic and

310
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.170
Nicole Bacon: I've got

311
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Good reason I'm defending. I've got a good reason. I, uh huh.

312
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My future you don't owe her an explanation.

313
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right real of if the defiance is

314
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to explain myself.

315
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.990
Nicole Bacon: Maybe that's it. We don't know. We're doing it.

316
00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, check into that we're looking around. We're playing here. So what if it's that curiosity thing. What if it's remember that one we did you

317
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what could you say Were you were not afraid of me.

318
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:15.240
Nicole Bacon: What because if you had any days that you

319
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.700
Nicole Bacon: Didn't want to put any makeup on.

320
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: My gosh what did that feel like

321
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:23.460
Way.

322
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.520
Nicole Bacon: Way better

323
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Different. Now I have to answer your question, what you

324
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Did was you took your racket.

325
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, nice backswing. And you followed it back to her side.

326
00:34:41.490 --> 00:35:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a new game and you asked her a question. When you ask a question, you take that heat that she dumped on you and you put it back on her side where it belongs. You put all of that energy five thing. You're right. You have a better grasp on that kind of language stuff.

327
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.080
Nicole Bacon: I don't live in a

328
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Live

329
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing but I like it. But bottom line is we

330
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

331
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, put it back on her side, different game you falling it back now she has to answer now it. There's any number of things that can happen. Oh, don't you be sassy with me. Who knows, I don't know what she's gonna say um

332
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.890
Nicole Bacon: No, she probably just laugh and like change the subject.

333
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's nice.

334
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you were

335
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I do not play racquetball we're playing

336
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:59.940
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, cuz I learned that, you know, like in in school growing up like with my last name, bacon, like, oh yeah, will tell me something I haven't heard de de but in relation to my family. Like I never learned that skill ever like growing up. I know. Yeah, well,

337
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That would have been inconvenient for your mother when

338
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:04.560
Nicole Bacon: She

339
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Does the same

340
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing.

341
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:08.790
Nicole Bacon: She did.

342
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, either grandma doesn't know either because notice she doesn't know what to do with you. Well, as soon as you don't play the game. It's just a word game when you stop analyzing and interpreting what that trick is you opt out. Just stop down

343
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself. You're not liking that conversation. You have a right to not like the conversation like this topic. I don't like a never have stupid TalkBack.

344
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.440
Nicole Bacon: You say,

345
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You say yourself, obviously, and

346
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be quiet also

347
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:48.750
You can just hit her.

348
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And she can say, Why are you being quiet what's going on. I just for even thinking about what you said.

349
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.990
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I remember that one too.

350
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Yeah, that would do. I repeat it. I love the broken record. I'm not trying to assume I haven't said it, but I like the broken

351
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.550
Nicole Bacon: No please remind me because my memories like

352
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.250
We forget

353
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: We forget because then, okay, that's that brass, and then I might remember these fun little tricks.

354
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.390
Mm hmm.

355
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.420
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah you ever had a day that you didn't feel like putting your makeup on.

356
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: By the way, Grandma, you all. You always look spot on, you know, you don't have to get a look all party for me.

357
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. We should have like a just a spa day grandma where we just, like, ah, we're just gonna be in the rocks can where I can dance all day, and we're gonna massage are foodies and we're going to get you see it now. Yeah. Now you can play with her.

358
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:51.420
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, which that's ultimately like she loves playing. She's like a little kid.

359
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.520
Yeah.

360
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, she stuck in the rules to

361
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She was around and hammered in look good as a girl look pretty. That's the most important thing. It's the most important thing somehow

362
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:23.160
Nicole Bacon: Right. Oh yeah, freshman year. She's already like I met this guy yet. Well, I want to introduce like she was already talking about me having babies it freshman

363
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.460
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

364
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

365
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.640
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's good that she's been

366
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.380
Nicole Bacon: But now I feel a sense of, like, not just dreading it of like having a couple tools.

367
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.480
Nicole Bacon: So yay.

368
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.730
Nicole Bacon: Yay. Yeah.

369
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what happens when we don't see them as a threat. They're just people they're doing the best they can. She's over there.

370
00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Just trying to find a way to connect with you. What if that's what it is. What if she wants to be of service to you. Right. Yeah.

371
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.380
Yeah.

372
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exciting.

373
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.170
Nicole Bacon: That's another

374
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Person.

375
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets love you. That's another person that you get to feel supported by because they're not scary, right. That's nice. Yeah, yeah.

376
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to decide what we want to talk about. That's what I mean by difference

377
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my moment.

378
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This conversation that we have, you know, pop psychology that word boundary. Well, you can use it all you want, or mindfulness or whatever. But there's a whole other level to really grow rocking it to getting it down on a cellular level ally know my bounce.

379
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Really knowing it.

380
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then relaxing into it because it's, it's just, you're so used to honoring it

381
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.850
Nicole Bacon: That's gonna be awesome. That's awesome.

382
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.680
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

383
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: not taught in most homes not taught in most schools. Okay, so we learn it. Now we know better. We do better. Just keep it in those dichotomous terms cheese. It's catchy.

384
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:34.680
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

385
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's use what you just did and really get a nice deep groove on this skill around the way you can just lie to mom because that one just came up to got a little bit of time. It's

386
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The same kind of thing.

387
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.030
Uh huh.

388
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't write you don't lie. You don't like flying. I think you

389
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:02.820
Nicole Bacon: Probably

390
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of pride in authenticity and

391
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.900
Nicole Bacon: Right. And I just learned, like to

392
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:22.680
Nicole Bacon: You know, I, I was the only child didn't have siblings. I was always around grown up. So I was taught kind of old respect your grown ups by

393
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:31.050
Nicole Bacon: Answering all their questions, doing what they think is the right thing and that is

394
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.720
Nicole Bacon: No, no.

395
00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know it's confusing. That's why the choices we go crazy.

396
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Run away use drugs or die. Right. It's like one of those like what, right, what are we supposed to do with this.

397
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and now you're learning you opt out.

398
00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You pay attention to how your gut feels every time. How does my throat. Feel how does my chest feel my hand sweating.

399
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is my reading

400
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I breathing. Am I even remembering to breathe in my so like freaking out.

401
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:18.000
Nicole Bacon: The other day I saw this woman talking about

402
00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:27.690
Nicole Bacon: She had gone through cancer and she she beat it and how she looks at the world is that that

403
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:51.240
Nicole Bacon: She thinks that we all only have a certain amount of energy and it and looking at situations and whatever does my energy, do I want to even put this in this situation, and I really liked thinking about that, like,

404
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:57.090
Nicole Bacon: It's like wasting energy. Not like but just kind of

405
00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.390
Nicole Bacon: Speaking of when it matters or

406
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.040
Nicole Bacon: You know, really thinking before

407
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:14.550
Nicole Bacon: Speaking sometimes because the automatic is to have an automatic response, real quick, you know,

408
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.500
Nicole Bacon: And I kind of like that thinking about that for a little bit.

409
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear you take the metaphor too far.

410
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.390
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

411
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear you but it could it could go far. That certainly Chinese medicine and a lot of different theory uses this concept of energy.

412
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe even

413
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a finite amount of it and it just changes form I die I feed right trees. The grass.

414
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn into a meal for something else.

415
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I just transform

416
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So you like this idea, this notion of energy. Do you like the idea of it being

417
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Finite or that there's a

418
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Scarcity to it and you not want to

419
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Parcel it off to some people. And some people you do, and you get filled with others. What do you like about this metaphor event.

420
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.700
Nicole Bacon: I like it more of like the way of you know that

421
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:40.800
Nicole Bacon: It's precious precious amount. And when I was going through the trauma and whatever I didn't feel like I had a lot because I was stuck in the negative mindset. And so to keep in the positive mindset. It feels like the energy is my energy is building up and I'm getting stronger, but still

422
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.600
Nicole Bacon: Not a choose not to.

423
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:58.200
Nicole Bacon: Get into certain situations or or into even certain conversations. If I know it's going to be a waste or if it's going to be

424
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.500
Nicole Bacon: Not a waste of energy. But just like

425
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:03.420
What's

426
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no

427
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.190
Nicole Bacon: Way being in control, again, of being in control of my

428
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.350
Nicole Bacon: Energy and how I wanna

429
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, there we go.

430
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.150
Nicole Bacon: In the world and we go yeah

431
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe it's so if we use that metaphor. When we say you're acknowledging that it's precious no one taught you really how to protect your own energy. People can suck it out idea. They didn't teach you how to hold on to it right

432
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.080
Nicole Bacon: Right.

433
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we use that metaphor, there's this acknowledgement. It's precious you're learning

434
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How to hold on to it and parcel it out to those that you choose are worthy.

435
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You

436
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Now your skills and your ability to radar and find people that are worthy. I'm still kind of watching you.

437
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:07.890
Nicole Bacon: Yes, please watch me

438
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, you know, I told you I'm

439
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'll tell you exactly what I'm thinking. And I'm I'm watching because

440
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been a disregard for your preciousness

441
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.730
Nicole Bacon: You're right, and

442
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So, first there's that acknowledgement of your precious right very precious

443
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And worthy of looking inward and acknowledging it

444
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And whatever amount of time that takes and

445
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:51.000
So what's coming up for you just now.

446
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.460
Nicole Bacon: I just have

447
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.820
Nicole Bacon: I want to get your opinion on something.

448
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:23.070
Nicole Bacon: I feel like one of my, I don't know. I call it super powers or just one of my gifts is people just tell me their inner secrets. The first time I meet them. And I don't know, like, usually I just go with it and that it up, but I'm finding that like I don't know what

449
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.100
Nicole Bacon: Skills, I can do.

450
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it. Yeah, let's you don't have to come up with all but

451
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Water is simple but, doggone it, we need it. Listen, with the basics. Because I'm going to tell you will do a lot of talking will do a lot of dancing around lots of imagery and it's going to probably come down to a couple of really basic things that will be with you forever.

452
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not fancy, but there's some basics that are that are super, super helpful. So let's just look I don't even know where we're going to go but

453
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You liked the metaphor of energy. Why don't we stick with that one. I don't even know where this will take us. Let's go together. I don't have an answer for you. Let's go play together with energy want you to picture that person who just unloads their wounding on you.

454
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see it right, you've got a few images of that.

455
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:20.940
Mm hmm.

456
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.100
What happens to the color.

457
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.530
To the vibration

458
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To the speed to the size of that energy when you are around someone unloading their wounding on you.

459
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:46.470
Nicole Bacon: Gets like mucky like mucky energy and it gets kind of like hot

460
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.680
Nicole Bacon: And reddish orange.

461
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:52.350
Okay.

462
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:56.820
Nicole Bacon: And it happens a lot.

463
00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So you're bringing it up for a reason, right. This is something you want to be able to address out there in the world, people don't have

464
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Good boundaries themselves right they over share to stand up the sign of their poor boundaries. They didn't test you out. They didn't ask you, do you want to hear a little bit. They. That's what we do when we have good register boundaries. We go like this.

465
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That reminds me of my crummy childhood and then we look at the person we're talking right

466
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.870
Nicole Bacon: Yeah check in.

467
00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: check in and see if you're interested. And if you go like this.

468
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever talked to a professional about that I ran into a therapist. That's really good. I wasn't expecting it. She looked like a square, but she ended up kind of being cookie.

469
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:59.970
Nicole Bacon: I had this random woman come up to me in the Walgreens parking lot and just

470
00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's abusive, Nicole. Doesn't it feel like that.

471
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:08.610
Yeah.

472
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.260
Nicole Bacon: I'm tired of being that for people

473
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.830
Nicole Bacon: Because I just think people

474
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.570
Nicole Bacon: Think I kind of look like childlike, are they, I'm

475
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.360
Nicole Bacon: Just all around me and they're just

476
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't

477
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Matter. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. That's right. Just yuck.

478
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a violation. It's on invited

479
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's the same damn thing is someone putting their paws. It's the same thing. And this stuff. No one says, here's the scar. No one says this is not okay. They just, they think you're being a bad insensitive not nice little girl.

480
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your social doctrine is

481
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, but that's a violation. And I'm telling you.

482
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not okay.

483
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's right.

484
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to hear it. It's not okay, it's a violation. They may not do that. They may not put that yuck.

485
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.700
Over here. No, no. Yeah.

486
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you have choice.

487
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in the moment gets real complicated and I give you some ideas. But the first one is that you first register. No.

488
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a no.

489
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: First, just sit there, that it is even okay that you register to know because your social doctrine is be a good girl, and be nice and you listen

490
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

491
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you get hurt that way.

492
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't that simple. It isn't there are real turkeys that are at

493
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Insensitive and hurtful and I don't want you just know you better earn my respect all start with respecting you as a human. How about you respect me as a human. You don't don't your crap on me.

494
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I respect your space. I don't go see me going, knocking on your door. I'm not telling you all my stories dumping on you. I respect you, first as a human. Please respect my space right that's the

495
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the defiance. No, no.

496
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch it catch it, where you're going to feel it somewhere in your body. First, I know no one believes me but your body's going to know the know before you come up with the word because you've been trained to say yes and good girls just going to listen answer their questions and be held.

497
00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo listen, listen, listen.

498
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:04.500
Nicole Bacon: Now usually like if it's really extreme are like, yeah.

499
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.470
Nicole Bacon: Go back really quick. Yeah.

500
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.690
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

501
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But the teachers in our life are slicker than that. That woman comes at you route of the blue.

502
00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds important for you. I wonder who you can talk to about that. I'm going over here. No, ma'am. That sounds important You need to find someone to hear you see this hand, you need to protect yourself. She was coming at you in a violent way.

503
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:39.870
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

504
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: May have had some mental illness that but you don't contain that for someone else. No, she needs professional help. I'm going this way.

505
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not the right person to hear your stories.

506
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Note and pause out

507
00:53:59.220 --> 00:53:59.610
I'm

508
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way you do this comes at you. You gotta write this is just this is important, but you got to protect this

509
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:14.550
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:16.830
Nicole Bacon: Your new

511
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Your training has conditioned you

512
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: to second guess that intuition is there. You know what's acceptable to your energy field. You do know you do know you do register it just gotten out of the habit.

513
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Of honoring it. And so, so it's just going to be back in just a nice atonement of

514
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like

515
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I am around you.

516
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like who I am around you and you

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I like who I am around you.

Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hang around you. I'm gonna ask you out and tie with you you I like who I am around you.

519
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.970

Gwenevere Abriel: You got your shit together you know don't want your crap on me. That's nice. Oh, I like that. I'm gonna be around some people that don't dump all over me or exploit me. Okay. Yeah. Oh, you got a little bit of that. I'm gonna keep an eye on you, your, your, maybe you see it.

521
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.170
Nicole Bacon: Right, yeah.

522
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:34.290
Nicole Bacon: And and I've noticed something like

523
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.300
Nicole Bacon: Okay, when people text me quick question.

524
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.440
Nicole Bacon: That's like

525
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:49.650
Nicole Bacon: And then it's something like really strange or weird or something that

526
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:56.340
Nicole Bacon: Could have totally waited. That's like green, red flags up for me.

527
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and texting. Anyway, you don't you don't like them. You don't want to rapid fire. And anyone who's been listening to you is going to remember that.

528
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

529
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think about every time I text you I'm like oh my gosh I do so much texting now because you guys your lives are like roller coasters.

530
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:16.890
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

531
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think Oh no. What if I've just charged her up and gotten her, like, Oh, no.

532
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:33.420
Nicole Bacon: Oh, it was the non tech scene that freaked me out because I forgot about group and then usually you texted me

533
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:35.910
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. And then I was like,

534
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.770
Nicole Bacon: Well, I'm coming in. I'm in the middle of the ocean.

535
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So this is how the teacher shows up. Everybody showed up yesterday I was a back to back. I barely eight right so i i had like no time.

536
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right then there might have been a little something in the back like

537
00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to texture. This is too important. There might have been a little something in the back ground fuzzy static thing might have had so much at the back there. But honestly, I was fried. Yes.

538
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, but that's the way these lessons come at you with this is just really right now. This is you're going to call this one now. Yes, life is going to do that.

539
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.950
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah.

540
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what to do with the text, how is that any different, how, what's wrong with

541
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand this text and you write it. I don't understand your text or you just put it down. Don't answer right. You do the analysis you do all this work the same in person.

542
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:56.640
Nicole Bacon: I'm I just I just put it down. I might I give. It's really important. You'll call me. I feel like

543
00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.440
Nicole Bacon: Yes, but the quick question thing is is like

544
00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:22.740
Nicole Bacon: I almost feel like that's a like they're testing or something like quick question. Can I bug you can they bug you can make quick question. Can I quickly bug you real quick. Like, can you quickly give me a little bit of validation and and attention. Quickly, quickly, just a little smidgen

545
00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, has the balls to actually call me and have a conversation

546
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:27.840
Yeah.

549
00:58:41.880 --> 00:59:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I have time for nice slow respectful communication, where I share and vulnerable and then you share a little and we see for okay we crack some jokes we are tender and careful I have time for that. I want you to write that back.

550
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have time to be deliberate and conscious and intentional with your communication with me then, yeah, I've got some time.

551
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:12.360
