Well,

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's hear it. What kind of a wicked. He had

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.470
Cynthia We: I'm a pretty good productive.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.580
Cynthia We: As I met with Helga

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.100
Cynthia We: And I met with her a couple weeks ago. And so I'm still working on the edits from when we met last time.

10
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.170
Cynthia We: And, uh,

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.790
Cynthia We: But we just had a a social meeting. So that was nice because I like

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.910
Cynthia We: And then taken through up in my car after break dancing class on Tuesday.

13
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For just over exertion. You think

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.830
Cynthia We: No, I think he has a stomach flu.

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:13.020
Cynthia We: It was so much stuff and he tried to open the door and it's locked. You know, the back doors lack

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:29.280
Cynthia We: We were almost home, but he tried to like he tried to get out and he tried to do it. So it went all over the door and you know like in all the little holes this female. Yeah, it's really bad. My car smells like moment. It's really I've cleaned it three times.

17
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.430
Cynthia We: It's an every crevice

18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.990
Cynthia We: It's so gross. And it reminded me

19
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.490
Cynthia We: Of when they were little, and that should happen all the time. You know, like I'm grateful that I haven't had to clean up a mess like that a long time.

20
00:01:48.660 --> 00:02:01.440
Cynthia We: Um, and it also reminded me of a college when my my roommates and I were taking the dogs to get a flea dip. For some reason, we had to go to Tom's over to do it and I'm

21
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:14.760
Cynthia We: The dog was sitting on my roommates Sandy's lap. It wasn't these weren't her dogs. They were West West and my dog. Um, but for some reasons by five years. I'm seeing these lap and poop.

22
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.430
Cynthia We: And then stepped in it.

23
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.650
Cynthia We: Was

24
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.860
Cynthia We: Everywhere. It was in every crevice in my car and poor Sandy was just like

25
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.280
Cynthia We: Like it smelled so bad. And then, you know, I took it to the carwash and they were like, what, it got on the seat belt.

26
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.140
Cynthia We: The belt rolled up

27
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What a what a mess, but

28
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.470
Cynthia We: Yeah, that's what it reminded me of. So that was pretty funny.

29
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.830
Cynthia We: That it has not been working on.

30
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Are you liking or not liking that.

31
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.200
Cynthia We: Um, he is very miserable. So I would prefer that he goes to work so so you're not, you know, it's not so visible.

32
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well let's let's get into it. Um. Want me to kind of take a look at

33
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That texts that came pretty quickly after we had met

34
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.330
Cynthia We: Oh, I don't even remember why don't we do that, let's say,

35
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You had it. I checked in on you. On February 20 you said you were heading to the gym you're staying with you.

36
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.280
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

37
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, before that we have. Alright, so we I check in with you on the 18th at about 810 your time 610 I send those emojis and use Liam's not coming brakes are going to be a grand

38
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Boat. Oh, should Scott come. Oh, you asked about. Okay, so that's fine. So we're just the one where you were in distress. I'm trying

39
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To

40
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.550
Cynthia We: I was a couple weeks ago.

41
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But, um, Yes, I remember. There we go, that's what we did. We did a lot of that we did this em, Dr. It really sort of zero in on there.

42
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.730
Cynthia We: Yeah.

43
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice following that intervention.

44
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice

45
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.550
Cynthia We: I wrote for a couple hours after that.

46
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.820
Cynthia We: Yeah, I wrote, um,

47
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.260
Cynthia We: I wrote this whole thing about

48
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.390
Cynthia We: The shame thing. I don't think I've ever

49
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:54.000
Cynthia We: I don't think anybody has ever identified that that's what I was having like I've been in therapy for years and years and years and years. And I don't like the one couples counselor noticed that

50
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: She talked about the

51
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.010
Cynthia We: World.

52
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:04.020
Cynthia We: Yeah, she talked about the spiral. But, you know, it was like, it's up to your individual therapists work with that work with you, Matt. Um,

53
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.870
Cynthia We: I really, I really

54
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.270
Cynthia We: I really am cognizant of it and I

55
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.520
Cynthia We: Appreciate that. Because I think that that is like the root of

56
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.690
Cynthia We: Why I seem to get nowhere. No.

57
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So let's not let go of it, you, you, you're, you're, you're

58
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Not on upset about it existing which could have been station, because normally you'd be ashamed about having the shame.

59
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.710
Cynthia We: Right.

60
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

61
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.140
Totally

62
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a layer off like it's right. So we're onto something. Why don't we just keep the momentum going.

63
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.790
Cynthia We: Yes. That's great. Well,

64
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Then let me turn

65
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This these iterations are all typed out in front of me.

66
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's very, very long, but I want to bring my eyes down to sort of the last couple. So we've got after this 10th iteration solution will always be to go to a meeting.

67
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, remember, yep.

68
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.600
Cynthia We: I remember what this week to yeah deal with feeling stressed.

69
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you go, or did it. Did you just get

70
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.530
Cynthia We: Out, but I thought about it.

71
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.070
Okay.

72
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.310
Cynthia We: Well, this is more than I've done in years.

73
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. So, but what that is is

74
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a I won't suffer alone notion that accompanies that distress.

75
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.520
Cynthia We: Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. I've got this

76
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:50.610
Cynthia We: Way and I'm trying to bring you back, sorry, I'm sorry. So I won't suffer alone. Yes.

77
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're right you're starting to remember things which says to me.

78
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That when the distress gets activated, it's not getting up so high that the rest of your brains, not working. So what's saying to me, is your stress level isn't getting quite as high.

79
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're able to access memory able to remember something else to do. And, you know, so far I've heard sort of this appreciation that we're getting somewhere with our, our current investigation.

80
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's cool.

81
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.620
Cynthia We: That's very good.

82
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.480
Cynthia We: So let's give it a go reciting

83
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So let's let's keep this keep this. Let me just see if I can bring us back to where we left off.

84
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So after the realization. I can go to a meeting, I gotta remember i can i can go there somewhere. I can go to feel connected

85
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: To people that I, I will not be judged by there will be understanding and people who get me friends that I haven't seen in a long time. When I see them I'm reminded about a camaraderie.

86
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: They, they know my dark secrets and they don't think I'm a bad person. They totally get it.

87
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't act like they don't act like themselves with was it they don't act like themselves either right when they use that is separate from who they are as a person to remember this week, being able to see

88
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: an addict does these things, right, that are different than who I am. Okay. But that's an important piece for a lot of people got you've got that one and

89
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we got invited awareness of worse piece okay imagery friends and I'm MK 11th integration, it is important that they are separate things. There we go. That same the addict voice versus the authentic voice. It's important that they are separate things.

90
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't make me about person just because I did things when I was using. They are two separate entities.

91
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Very nice. Let's go, let's do more of that. Let me just make sure our you're on a laptop. Yes, good, good, good, good, good, fantastic. And let's get I kicked

92
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:24.030
Cynthia We: Take it out of the bedroom next door. Well, I actually asked him if he could put some music on because I didn't want him listening.

93
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

94
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.430
Cynthia We: Go to the living room. Okay.

95
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, see you protected your environment, you did some preparation, so that you don't have anything to get as a distraction. That was smart, smart. All right, I'm just

96
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.670
Look at this little thing here.

97
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm pretty sure

98
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.200
Yeah, we'll leave it there. All right, let me go back in

99
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And see where we started, we started with.

100
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.160
Okay. After 40

101
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So you started with negative brought in positive

102
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You were easily distracted by Scott making noise outside of the door. Yeah.

103
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want to do something else with you today. I mean the same intervention, but try this on Sunday. See if you can find an earlier time

104
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've said them in here before when

105
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Concepts of I'm not good enough.

106
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Have come up. But, see if you can find one in your family of origin.

107
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to find an early age of that early imagery

108
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard about 37 we address the substance use piece. Let's see if we can go a little further back.

109
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.660
Cynthia We: Oh,

110
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We got one.

111
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.840
Cynthia We: Yeah, I do.

112
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What age are you

113
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.780
Cynthia We: I'm maybe eight

114
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And what, what did you just picture just now.

115
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.080
Um,

116
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.760
Cynthia We: We were on a boat, like a riverboat

117
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.390
Cynthia We: For some reason, celebrating something

118
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.570
Cynthia We: With the people. My dad worked with

119
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.310
Cynthia We: Grandma and Grandpa, because my grandma worked for the company and I'm

120
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:17.130
Cynthia We: Somebody had made fun of Uncle Jerry's driving the boat, like they said something like, where'd you get your license in a cracker jack box. And I just thought it was the funniest thing. And so I kept repeating it because you know like eight year old seven year olds don't don't have any

121
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.330
Cynthia We: Oh, right, yeah. I'm explaining, sorry.

122
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:32.310
Cynthia We: Catch. Yes. Okay. I see low I see other kids doing that. And I understand that this is a normal thing for that age, but time I can

123
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I kept joking.

124
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.080
Cynthia We: I kept joking. I kept pushing. Yes.

125
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You are having fun. We're

126
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:47.370
Cynthia We: Having fun. I was totally loving the fact that the adults were laughing at something that I said

127
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you wait. When did Jerry's Facebook life when Can he hear you.

128
00:12:52.470 --> 00:13:11.310
Cynthia We: Yeah, he was laughing He thought it was a he thought it was very. They all thought it was very funny that I said because I said the same thing, I repeated the adult, I guess. Okay. Um, but that was funnier to them. Then when my, I think my dad said it originally and I'm

129
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Starting to slow down. Cindy, slow, slow way down, take a breath.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.750
Cynthia We: How could I not know that it wasn't appropriate for me to say that

145
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.810
Cynthia We: You know, to repeat that and

146
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.330
And and

147
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:52.440
Cynthia We: I don't know if it was at that boy or later basically was right that and that she told me that it's not appropriate for a child to be talking to an adult in that manner.

148
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.180
Cynthia We: And and

149
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:14.100
Cynthia We: It's not, it's not okay for a child, talk to an adult or to joke with an adult like that, or to talk to an adult like that. And, um, it was in front of everybody and I just felt deflated and horrified and embarrassed and

150
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.810
Cynthia We: I'm

151
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.260
Cynthia We: Like, I should have known.

152
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Before you go there. Do you know that you said earlier, how could I

153
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Have known

154
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, he said that earlier. How could I have known.

155
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You said it here just so

156
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.760
Cynthia We: I have known. Yeah, okay, good. I

157
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.710
Cynthia We: Won't I there's no way I could have known.

158
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

159
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.110
Cynthia We: What I expected myself to know and I was I was embarrassed that I didn't know

160
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so stop. This is really rich just let it sit there. Okay.

161
00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I was paying attention to Jerry's face.

162
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Do you remember that.

163
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.710
Cynthia We: Well,

164
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We sat there.

165
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He's lingered in it. I was using my senses. I saw him, smiling and you heard people laughing

166
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You were using your senses, your social skills.

167
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It was you were being reinforced for doing it.

168
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mother humiliated, you

169
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Father, mother, you're remembering it as mother, which will just right.

170
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There's one thing to be redirected

171
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In private

172
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's another

173
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In public

174
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't use the word humiliation, you put embarrassed.

175
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:00.540
But

176
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but the humiliation. Right. That's from outside.

177
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

178
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: thought there was something wrong with you instead of this was inappropriate. You did it. You can't control these big people out here. Mom, did this thing she humiliated you and you turn to you saying I did something wrong.

179
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's why we went slow in the beginning, Cindy.

180
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.160
No.

181
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't

182
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else

183
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: got irritated.

184
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Jealous annoyed embarrassed, Mom.

185
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: dumped her stuff on you.

186
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. He could have said.

187
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I am annoyed with the 50th time you've cracked that same joke. It was five minutes ago. I'm get some new material Cindy Lou who

188
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Come over here, sleepy. Basically we find it funny for about the first three times. It's super cute because an eight year old did it, but it'll end up being just like, you know, that's all played out girl so she could have handled it in a different way and taught you.

189
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To keep your eye on people's faces like look at mine. I'm your mom. Notice how I was laughing before. Now I'm not laughing because things are only funny for a little while when the novelty of the irony of a little kid getting sarcasm.

190
00:18:45.900 --> 00:19:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And that edginess of being able to make fun of a respected adult is now it's now played out. But this is a new moment. This was a a teaching moment for your mom. Yeah, she didn't teach you. She humiliated, you

191
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: She could have done it differently.

192
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.630
Cynthia We: Yeah, totally. You're totally right.

193
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:23.310
Cynthia We: I'm worried that I I would repeat that and cause such trauma in my own

194
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We could spend our whole time distracting about that.

195
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Really ashamed about it if you want to swim in that for an hour.

196
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.650
Cynthia We: Demo. I don't really want to swim in it. I just

197
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't think so. So

198
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: My point is, you found one.

199
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an early conditioned habit of when you see your reality you we were using reality you're paying you know you're doing your thing going outside.

200
00:19:53.100 --> 00:20:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it basically said you're the problem or how you interpreted it was. You're the problem you're the problem. That's the only thing you can control issue and I'm to blame. I'm flawed and broken I'm fallible, and you go there.

201
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But it isn't one or the other all the time. It moves and changes and it's nuanced and you didn't know when enough was this is a really new social moment.

202
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is five times too much, maybe with a different audience twice would have been too much, but four times five times six times that was about when they started maybe to getting a little, like, oh, a day.

203
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But how are we supposed to know when enough is we were reinforced for maybe I'll get more if I keep doing and I'll get more it's fun and having fun with adults.

204
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There was nothing wrong with what you did.

205
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go back, let's work with this one.

206
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So how distressing. Just now when you were doing that river boat and that

207
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Realization of being deflated embarrassed and horrified. You said yeah what number from zero to 100 without so I get a PUT IN RIGHT PLACE.

208
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.680
Cynthia We: Because

209
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.980
4050

210
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And back then, what was it,

211
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:37.980
Oh 9095

212
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost 100 yeah that's really high, so

213
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only the approval of your mother for home is right mother and father are these like godlike figures we need them to take care of us feed us there, everything

214
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But you had a whole bunch of people around you.

215
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were not empowered with what to do not only with what was going on, not knowing what enough was. But what to do with the helplessness that comes from

216
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Embarrassment

217
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, giving you a little phrase that you could play with to play it off so that the price doesn't get so smashed deflated right

218
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a teaching opportunity and it was missed your parent could have used that as as a learning opportunity for you.

219
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's go with this one. Okay, see if you go to this eight year old self, and to Cynthia right

220
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.850
Mm hmm. Okay.

221
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you believe about yourself at that time.

222
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

223
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.740
Awesome.

224
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.200
Cynthia We: That's funny people like me.

225
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a positive one. Did you feel like people like me, I'm awesome when your mom said enough

226
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.120
Whoa.

227
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.610
Cynthia We: No, that's

228
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what was your belief about yourself. That's the one.

229
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.720
Cynthia We: Yeah, I'm

230
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.150
Cynthia We: An idiot

231
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.770
Cynthia We: I'm stupid.

232
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So in your family. You're supposed to know before you've learned

233
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.490
Yeah.

234
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote down I'm awesome. And people like me, but let's play with this idiot and stupid piece a little bit more

235
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: At the time, and not that shaping moment.

236
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of, I'm an idiot.

237
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: In that space of not having learned yet what to do because you're just a little girl.

238
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Believed about yourself.

239
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.570
Cynthia We: I'm learning.

240
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:47.220
Cynthia We: Me. Yeah, I can know I know how to be funny, but, um, I haven't learned yet how to

241
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:48.990
Cynthia We: What

242
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.650
Cynthia We: I haven't learned this social skills.

243
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.210
Right.

244
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That was a very novel event.

245
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No way. You could have known.

246
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.700
Yeah.

247
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's work with that.

248
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to share the screen with you and

249
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The distress level that you're at right now still like around 40 okay if it starts to go up too high, and it's not some where you want to be can just do this and we'll stop or if you want a little bit more. You're liking.

250
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The integration and weaving of positive images and thoughts and beliefs, then you can just sort of

251
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this. Okay, I'm remembering right I would never tell you to stop. Hello. Hello. Probably never forget said

252
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. It's not too dissimilar to the story. You just told

253
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.430
Cynthia We: It is, it's not. I don't see the connection.

254
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I don't have to. That's, that's, I can, I can do the analysis for you.

255
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

256
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to pay attention to what you want in this moment. Okay. Just pay attention to yourself and what you want more, whether you want to stop just pay close attention to it.

257
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like to do is HAS THE THE TEAM OF YEARS OF THE GYM Shaughnessy and Sally and Bob mer, have they changed it all has anything shifted or change. These are still okay these your peeps. Okay.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what was the emotion you fell when they were laughing and talking with you on the boat.

290
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.330
Cynthia We: I was happy because I

291
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't go with that we'll go with that. I want you to pull up the worst image of that.

292
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: deflating embarrassing.

293
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And

294
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The quality of your team. Laughing

295
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: He held together through the nose, big belly breath.

296
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

297
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, all the air out nice flat empty long

298
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And just be a witness compassionate.

299
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: witness to what comes up for you.

300
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.380
Um,

301
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:52.320
Cynthia We: I think that if they were actually there Jim Shaughnessy would say something to my mom.

302
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.660
Even say what

303
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.700
Cynthia We: Um,

304
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.930
Cynthia We: Well you protect me like

305
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.490
Cynthia We: Bye.

306
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.850
Cynthia We: Calling her out or

307
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.840
Cynthia We: Redirecting

308
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:23.070
Cynthia We: Like fixing what what it just happened so that I didn't feel bad. I feel like he would jump in.

309
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what he would be doing

310
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: In the jumping and could you hear his words.

311
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.940
Cynthia We: No, he hasn't said them. Yeah, I was just kind of idea that he he would

312
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so with that go with that.

313
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: First

314
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst case of that experience and what you just said.

315
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready, just

316
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.060
Let it all go

317
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.490
What's coming up for you.

318
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.970
Cynthia We: He says,

319
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.500
Keith

320
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.480
Cynthia We: Says, whoa, Carla.

321
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.470
Cynthia We: I don't. I thought she was very funny.

322
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.480
Cynthia We: And I

323
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.520
Cynthia We: Think. Maybe we just need to help her with some new material.

324
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go with that.

325
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.220
Okay.

326
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst piece of it, Cindy. Pull it up humiliation.

327
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And Jim says, Ooh, Carla. I thought she was funny. Just need to help her with some new material.

328
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

329
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.050
Cynthia We: Well, he starts working on new material with me.

330
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, how does that work.

331
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:25.380
Cynthia We: Yeah, he totally distracts me from the moment and and says, like, can you can you think about some other things that would be funny to say, and I'm of course I can't really come up with anything but

332
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:41.220
Cynthia We: But I don't have to feel like what I was feeling in a minute ago and focusing on what I can do is a better feeling

333
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Scale of one to seven. How true is it right now. I'm learning. I'm funny and I'm learning.

334
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.500
I'm

335
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.160
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

336
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll true

337
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.850
Cynthia We: I'm like a like a six. Okay.

338
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.540
Cynthia We: Yeah, I feel like

339
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's real. Oh, hold, hold that I'm learning in your awareness and that worst image okay to believe I'm learning.

340
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What were your thoughts.

341
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.370
Cynthia We: He can he's like God on my level.

342
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.070
Cynthia We: crouching down and he's showing me how I can watch people's faces when you say something

343
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.960
Cynthia We: We can see their reaction and how it's kind of subtle.

344
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.990
Cynthia We: That like real laughter is different than

345
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.720
Cynthia We: Pretend laughter

346
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.670
Cynthia We: And

347
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:45.390
Cynthia We: That there are a little, little hints to whether it's real or not. And he's teaching you that

348
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel to be learning

349
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.870
Cynthia We: Awesome.

350
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I go with that. Worst Picture feeling awesome as you're learning

351
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The subtle.

352
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Reactions, in effect, faces being shown

353
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What to watch for

354
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly breath.

355
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You can share with me what you notice

356
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.870
Cynthia We: Um, well, he

357
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.620
Cynthia We: shows me

358
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:13.050
Cynthia We: He's like, watch this. And he tells a terrible, knock knock joke.

359
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.790
Cynthia We: And

360
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:19.080
Cynthia We: He's like, watch people's faces when I tell this joke and

361
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:31.020
Cynthia We: Then comes back down and is explaining to me the how I can see the subtle difference in their face and in their reaction, they didn't think that that was funny.

362
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:33.960
Cynthia We: But they were pretending

363
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Can Cynthia see difference between a fake pretend

364
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.410
Cynthia We: Yes. Well, now I can because somebody

365
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.950
Taught me

366
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that go with that seeing it, and worst image.

367
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you.

368
00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.680
Cynthia We: Well, I feel like

369
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.090
Cynthia We: Really smart. I got something I have like the key to

370
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:57.450
Cynthia We: I don't know, it's, I have something no other eight year olds has because nobody nobody

371
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.570
Cynthia We: Learns these things until they're much older.

372
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:06.090
Cynthia We: And Jimmie Johnson just taught me so feel

373
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.690
Cynthia We: Like I'm way ahead and I'm way smart.

374
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So how true is it I'm smart awesome and funny.

375
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:23.550
Cynthia We: Like us seven. Well, yeah, if I imagined myself back then. I don't really think that now.

376
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how you

377
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how true is it right now. I'm smart, funny and awesome

378
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.860
Cynthia We: Like a degree.

379
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why it's a three and not a four.

380
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:45.570
No.

381
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't who might know

382
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If not, you

383
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.110
Cynthia We: I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to say Bob, but I think just trying to see what know

384
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a recollection. In a recent history where you didn't feel smart, funny and awesome trigger

385
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

386
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.910
Cynthia We: Damn.

387
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:31.830
Cynthia We: I'm

388
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.740
Cynthia We: Most of the time.

389
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.700
Cynthia We: All interactions with my husband.

390
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.990
Pick one.

391
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.900
Cynthia We: Okay, I'm

392
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got one in there.

393
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.910
Cynthia We: Oh, I'm trying to think of a specific one.

394
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:00.510
Okay.

395
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

396
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:03.840
Cynthia We: Yes. Okay, I got it.

397
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: On it. Well, now find the most distressing part of that in your imagination, pull it up the zing the sap. The one that hurts the really emotional moment of it. Hold it there. Once you get it.

398
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

399
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up in this is hard work. Cindy pull up Jim may know

400
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Why you don't get to feel smart, funny and awesome

401
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the light

402
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can get him to help

403
00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:57.750
In some way

404
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing thoughts, beliefs,

405
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.310
Cynthia We: I'm

406
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:39.810
Cynthia We: Was kind of questioning why don't I feel smart, but I have all the answers.

407
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.010
Cynthia We: While I don't feel smart why I don't feel that I'm funny.

408
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.490
Cynthia We: And why I don't feel awesome

409
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do know what

410
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.590
Cynthia We: Well, in this particular instance, I don't know why.

411
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.180
Cynthia We: Well,

412
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.880
Cynthia We: I'm not sure.

413
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to believe

414
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Through ok ok let's let's not have let me keep guiding us. Okay, what's the belief about yourself right now.

415
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:16.350
Cynthia We: I

416
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.200
Cynthia We: Don't feel very smart.

417
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you confused. Oh, okay.

418
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Who might help you through this confusion of this versus that

419
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We can help with confusion.

420
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.680
I'm

421
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.310
Okay.

422
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you want to share with me is the confusion, you're not sure about how to interpret something

423
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: How to logistically analytically.

424
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right deconstruct. Is it a math problem is it

425
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:14.940
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's, it's a financial situation that we're in and I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY SMART wouldn't be in the situation.

426
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.720
Cynthia We: That we're in right now, which

427
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.830
Cynthia We: You know, you know what it is. Yeah, but

428
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess I'm having trouble maybe Jim knows. Let's go see maybe Jim knows what you're confused about because your therapist doesn't. So don't explain it, because I don't get it. Let's see if Jim can identify it pull up that piece that happened, maybe with Scott and you said you're confused.

429
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.090
Cynthia We: Okay.

430
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst part of that experience.

431
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: See if Jim

432
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Can explain to one of your the confusion.

433
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, as it comes up, you can share it during the iteration, if it comes up.

434
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.670
What's coming up for you.

435
00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.200
Cynthia We: I feel like maybe

436
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.510
Cynthia We: My confusion lies in Scott blaming putting blame on me and

437
00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:57.240
Cynthia We: And

438
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.810
Cynthia We: Yes, I did spend $20, I guess.

439
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.170
Cynthia We: But, but maybe it's not

440
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:23.700
Cynthia We: Maybe it's not all my fault. Maybe, maybe, maybe the whole thing isn't all my fault. Maybe I can share this with him and Jenna Shaughnessy jumping in and saying, Boys stop beating yourself up. It's not all your fault.

441
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:32.280
Cynthia We: You guys are in a situation and both of your fault, but that's okay. Everybody gets into trouble like that and

442
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.950
Cynthia We: Yes, you did spend the $20 on gas, but that doesn't mean that you're a piece of shit.

443
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So your confusion.

444
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.540
Cynthia We: My confusion is about him blaming me

445
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What you

446
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't

447
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Nation. If I'm Scott, I'm the one doing it to you.

448
00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: asked me a question.

449
00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.980
Cynthia We: Whoa, yeah. Okay.

450
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're confused.

451
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.510
Cynthia We: I'm the one. Yeah. What is it,

452
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:07.800
Well, yes.

453
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:13.860
Cynthia We: I'm

454
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.240
Cynthia We: Are you so mad at me.

455
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:26.610
Cynthia We: Yeah. What the fuck was I supposed to do, but not put gas in my car.

456
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of

457
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.530
Cynthia We: That is that very

458
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Much. Hang on, hang on.

459
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of a tear

460
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of a tear

461
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of shame I did something wrong. Instead of that, leading this exchange.

462
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember how it felt.

463
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm learning. Do you remember how it felt to be attuned to really know

464
00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I can pay attention to the changing subtle needs of my environment.

465
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Remember that

466
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.060
Cynthia We: We had to go

467
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to it. Okay.

468
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to it.

469
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And now.

470
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

471
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.890
Cynthia We: I see that you're upset that I've spent $20 on gas.

472
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

473
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.170
Why

474
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.120
Cynthia We: What did you

475
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.120
Cynthia We: Have plan for that.

476
00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:07.530
Money.

477
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how you feeling okay

478
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.120
Cynthia We: What I want to ask

479
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Once we get to do as many reduces you want you back to this.

480
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm confused about blame.

481
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, now this is tricky because

482
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know who's to blame on want to get into analysis. So stay with this are used. Let's take this word blame out. That's an interpretation. Why don't we do this. Okay.

483
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to really tune in and I know I'm not Scott, but you can picture his angry face or whatever.

484
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to it.

485
00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to it attuned to it.

486
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I'm learning. I'm paying attention to the cues to the subtle faces and gestures. I'm learning. I'm looking at someone's face and it looks a particular way, doesn't it, yes.

487
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, what are you confused about what are you confused about when you think

488
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.670
Cynthia We: About why he's so angry why he's acting angry when he's just scared. Let me

489
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.780
Say it to me.

490
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

491
00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:37.410
Cynthia We: Used about why you're acting so mad when I know you're just scary.

492
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.870
Cynthia We: Beautiful. Why not just show me that

493
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.310
Yeah.

494
00:52:48.540 --> 00:53:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I feel you're in a model instead of asking him to do it first. You do it I feel blank. When you do blank right here. You see my face. Go ahead.

495
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.480
Cynthia We: I feel afraid when you act injury.

496
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

497
00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any confusion about that.

498
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:18.510
Cynthia We: Well,

499
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you feel you know your feelings. You're afraid.

500
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: When I'm angry when I act out angry.

501
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.760
That's real for you.

502
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.090
There's no confusion.

503
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know exactly how you feel.

504
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, do you like it.

505
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.140
Cynthia We: No, I don't like it at all.

506
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Your interpretation of blaming

507
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the alien that somehow exists between my angry face and behavior.

508
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're feeling scared, but

509
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not blaming you. What do you mean blame gas was needed money is spent in in a civilized culture and society we spend money to buy gas. We don't barter eggs for it. I don't understand. I'm so confused.

510
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, how the hell you expect me to get anywhere if I don't put gas in the car.

511
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That is another version. It's some other reality that I don't even know if you have access to

512
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a dude.

513
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you put money in your gas tank.

514
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are responsible for the blame.

515
00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Blame, blame from childhood.

516
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I put

517
00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.480
Cynthia We: Get all my fault, but

518
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but you understand it's the wrong vocabulary word. It doesn't like it makes city. Here's your therapist gang. Oh, I didn't riled up because it doesn't. The word doesn't make sense. It's literally hitting this like disconnect for me.

519
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:19.680
Yeah.

520
00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I drive. We all know a drive.

521
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I put money in the tank.

522
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't understand your anger Scott WERE YOU NOT EXPECTING ME

523
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To keep the tank full were you expecting $5 tell me how this departs from your expectation, but the differences, Cindy. I'm not deflated. I don't default to bad girl.

524
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're confused because he is sending a mixed message that is crazy, making

525
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you ask you go

526
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you. Was it your expectation that I just not go anywhere. Kinda sorta or

527
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:19.080
Cynthia We: Keeping it on my way home from Albuquerque. So I certainly was going somewhere.

528
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.610
I

529
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Saw some

530
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:25.950
Yo,

531
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:32.100
Cynthia We: I got asked the question is why are you crazy.

532
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.950
Cynthia We: No. Why don't you get some therapy. Why don't talk to a therapist.

533
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.970
Cynthia We: No, no. I think the answer is that

534
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.480
Cynthia We: This doesn't happen so that it's not so distressing.

535
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got to go run a group but Cindy, listen to me. Yes. Is this what i'm doing over here, all this stuff that I do this other way of communicating with Scott. Does it seem like I'm from another planet. Um,

536
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:15.210
Cynthia We: No, it seems like you are rational, and that's how adult responds and

537
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.310
Cynthia We: I aspire to respond.

538
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you get your face to match your confusion. You go, Scott, I'm confused because you're acting angry about a $20 thing that goes in gas.

539
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't quite get it. You'll have to help me understand that I'm really the the reaction doesn't seem to match this is we all put gas in the tank.

540
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just tell me the intensity we expecting. I only keep it at sort of a $5 level throughout the day. I just want to understand. I'm confused about the reaction just it's not making sense.

541
00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not in shame. My I'm just paying attention to his face.

542
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like that's that's a confusing face. I want to learn what that thought goes with it. Scott and the logic and I want to understand what you're thinking.

543
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And Cindy. Remember when you were eight and you enjoyed learning yeah please hold on to that today you have that

544
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It's yours and you can tap into it anytime you want to. There's nothing wrong with asking a question. I don't understand the mismatch. It's, it's just something's not lining up the intensity your, you know, the anger.

545
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone cuts us off and puts our lives in danger. I get the anger, but

546
00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your expectation for filling up the tank you wanted to do it. You want to wait to the end of the week like let me and just showing the anger. It's very confusing.

547
00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I gotta go. Okay.

548
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:00.090
Excellent.

549
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you want to reschedule for next Thursday. What do you need to do.

550
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:05.580
Cynthia We: That would be great.

551
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I will see you there.

552
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Any group to if it's your time.

553
00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:12.210
Cynthia We: Um, yeah, it's not okay.

554
00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.020
All right.
