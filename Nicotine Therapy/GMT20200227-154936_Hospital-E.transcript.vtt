00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:49.890
Dawn Abriel: 27

2
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.930
Dawn Abriel: And this will be an individual intake.

3
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.430
Dawn Abriel: For Alicia.

4
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.460
Dawn Abriel: Know, Dell birthday august 27 1997

5
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.870
Dawn Abriel: And it will start at nine.

6
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.490
Alicia Noedel: Hello.

7
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.550
Dawn Abriel: Hi, I just opened. I, I, some people come early you're one of those

8
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.050
Dawn Abriel: I'm Dr brielle and you're Alicia.

9
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.130
Alicia Noedel: Yes, ma'am.

10
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.650
Dawn Abriel: And that's the right pronunciation

11
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.520
Yes.

12
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.250
Dawn Abriel: ELISA, yeah.

13
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.020
Dawn Abriel: Let me get to your chart so

14
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:54.000
Dawn Abriel: I was noticing I, my guess is that you didn't read the survey. Exactly right. But on one of the surveys, you put that you've never experienced any withdrawal.

15
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.290
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I thought I that's not true.

16
00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.010
Alicia Noedel: So,

17
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:10.080
Dawn Abriel: Then I saw another place where you said you did because that's why you want to get off the opioids. So I thought, I'm just going to put that in the statement when I

18
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.770
Dawn Abriel: Complete the chart. So it's because I can't, I can't actually change it, but I can mention that, that there was just a misunderstanding.

19
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:33.510
Alicia Noedel: Okay, I'm I was currently I've been on a program for Suboxone for somebody text for about a year now and my doctor. They're not specialists, they

20
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:47.700
Alicia Noedel: Changed my medication on me. And when they changed my medication from buprenorphine to buprenorphine naloxone I started having a lot of problems. I don't have, you know, energy, I have hives and

21
00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:01.740
Alicia Noedel: Just a lot of problems with it and they are not wanting to give me my original medication back so I that's why I seek you guys out because you know you're specialists that can probably helped me with my needs.

22
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.950
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Do you know why they did that.

23
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.330
Alicia Noedel: It's part of their policy, I guess.

24
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:21.060
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, most programs and most you know we're we're heavily regulated. We're told what you can do and what you can't do and

25
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:33.660
Dawn Abriel: One of them is to only give some text to a certain group of people. And my guess is that you didn't fit into that description.

26
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320
Dawn Abriel: You, your camera froze. So I don't know if you're still with me.

27
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.270
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I'm here.

28
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360
Dawn Abriel: Okay, yeah, the pictures frozen.

29
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.700
Dawn Abriel: They said that

30
00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:12.210
Alicia Noedel: My proof of hives and my proof of hives and my tattoo ink raising and my najah and I'm, you know, fatigue, wasn't enough of a sign for me to

31
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:23.190
Alicia Noedel: Go back to my original medication. It's just hard because I was on this medication for, you know, more than nine months, they never had a problem with it.

32
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.590
Alicia Noedel: I've never had any kind of wrong drug tests. I've never been an intravenous drug users. So that's never been a problem.

33
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.670
Dawn Abriel: Where do you do you work right now.

34
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.600
Alicia Noedel: I am currently um I I had a baby three months ago.

35
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.180
Alicia Noedel: So I'm just doing the at home mom thing now.

36
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.790
Dawn Abriel: Okay, good. Alright, so

37
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.350
Dawn Abriel: This program includes one hour a week of group and one hour a week of of individual therapy.

38
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.260
Dawn Abriel: So,

39
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.350
Dawn Abriel: I don't know what your other program was like, but this one requires both

40
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.790
Alicia Noedel: That's awesome. I like

41
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.330
Dawn Abriel: Okay. Okay. Have you been in therapy before

42
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:33.480
Alicia Noedel: I have had. Um so yeah relations. Um, I haven't been in like

43
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:46.950
Alicia Noedel: Recreational therapy going you know more than once or twice with a doctor because it I just never did. But I'm sure you know that me

44
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.030
Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:01.530
Dawn Abriel: I'm writing the therapist right now to see if she can come on while we're in here and say hello and set up a meeting time to get that started for you.

46
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.870
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

47
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.730
Dawn Abriel: Do you have a moment to

48
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.790
Dawn Abriel: Say hello.

49
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:32.040
Dawn Abriel: Oh, and I need to put the zoom room number 582-256-4197

50
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.760
Dawn Abriel: And then I have to press send, I don't go sin just sit

51
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.180
There.

52
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.300
Dawn Abriel: Things you have to get disciplined about okay so

53
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:56.010
Dawn Abriel: Recent mother staying home okay that that helps me know which group, you can probably go to

54
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.200
Dawn Abriel: Okay, she said yes. So she'll come in here. Her name is going to veer or gland. She

55
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.760
Dawn Abriel: Sometimes goes by.

56
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.380
Dawn Abriel: And your last dose of opioid or buprenorphine or sub you next

57
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.810
Alicia Noedel: Time I currently have some from my last doctor's visit with the doctor that I was seeing.

58
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.440
Alicia Noedel: Um, so I am still teaching

59
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.700
Alicia Noedel: But

60
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.510
Dawn Abriel: I know you're I need to know your last dose.

61
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.810
Alicia Noedel: Um, I took one eight milligram

62
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.520
Alicia Noedel: Tablet under my tongue when I woke up.

63
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.830
Dawn Abriel: Oh this am okay

64
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.420
Dawn Abriel: All right. And that last you for 24 hours.

65
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.180
Alicia Noedel: Yes, or I take two and a half a day for

66
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.760
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, two and a half.

67
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.330
Dawn Abriel: Sorry. Does that mean you're splitting them up.

68
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.820
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Okay. That is not the way the medicine was designed

69
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.970
Alicia Noedel: No, I take one and then I take another and then I take a half

70
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.770
Dawn Abriel: I know, I know. I'm telling you.

71
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:21.870
Dawn Abriel: In the, in the late 1990s, they designed this drug to be long acting to go through 36 hours.

72
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.930
Alicia Noedel: Okay, so what happens is

73
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.400
Alicia Noedel: they prescribe them to me.

74
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.250
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, in your I really

75
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.950
Dawn Abriel: strongly suggest that you take your

76
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:48.930
Dawn Abriel: Because my guess is that you only need two tablets. But if you took them at the same time you would get enough of a blood level to last you for the full time.

77
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.530
Dawn Abriel: So we'll talk about this more at the end. But this is going to vary. She's the therapist.

78
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.000
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

79
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.360
Alicia Noedel: Hello, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you all.

80
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So she probably asked me to jump in here because she's thinking about having you join one of the groups that I facilitate like on Thursday.

81
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. I saw your picture just froze. But so

82
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.270
Alicia Noedel: I'm here. Yeah.

83
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you

84
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: In school these days. What are you doing with your days.

85
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.540
Alicia Noedel: Um, I gave birth to a baby three months ago.

86
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.750
Alicia Noedel: Yummy. So I'm at home.

87
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. Okay. And so

88
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.770
Alicia Noedel: You know,

89
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your cell phone number.

90
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.730
Alicia Noedel: It's 505

91
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.980
Okay 603-203-3203

92
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to send you just a super quick little text and see if it gets to you. Okay. Let me just see. And then you'll have mine.

93
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Pfizer 5603 and then 3203 I'll just say hi Gwen. Yeah. Uh huh. Alright, see if you get that. And then if you do, then you can send it to me and I can kind of have your number in my phone, too. Um, so, how long have you been on the buprenorphine.

94
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.950
Alicia Noedel: Um, I have been on a actual program for

95
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.220
Alicia Noedel: Almost a year and a few months now, but

96
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:53.310
Alicia Noedel: I was buying it from people before because I didn't want to do you know heroin and opiates anymore.

97
00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you, I got you. Alright, so our next step would be to meet and do what's called a bio psychosocial on if you've ever been in treatment before, but it gets a little bit of history of

98
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not too different from what the doc is doing. She gets history. I go a little bit more in depth into a little bit of family and some

99
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: History around if there's any presence of anxiety or depression kind of ended those features.

100
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you up in right now, I'm booked out

101
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For this week, but are you possibly could you possibly meet

102
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: On a on a Saturday. What are you doing on a Saturday at 1030

103
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.720
Alicia Noedel: Nothing.

104
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well maybe right baby might be fussing or something but barring any sort of

105
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Napping issues for the baby. Do you want to meet them. Then we got it done. And then we can schedule a regular time during the week that works for you. Yeah.

106
00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:08.160
Alicia Noedel: That's perfect, because my mom can always help me right now. My fiance has her and she's here, you know, with us. He just to get out of the room, cuz she started a plus. But, um, that that can that can work out for me. Excellent.

107
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it. So all actually see you Saturday, February 29 at your time at 1030 I'm in Florida, so it's it's it's forward a couple hours, but you don't have to think about that.

108
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do my best to always say at a time in your time zone. Have you ever had any therapy before or any substance use actual treatment.

109
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:39.540
Alicia Noedel: Um, when I started the program and my previous doctor, they had me see a psychiatrist with like their in house psychiatrists

110
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:54.180
Alicia Noedel: And, you know, she just interviewed me to make sure that I didn't, you know, have any kind of psychological issues, but I'm pretty sure that was more for my pregnancy and less for, um, you know, my actual prescription

111
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.460
Alicia Noedel: But I'm

112
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So know sitting down once a week or every couple weeks talking

113
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: About okay well that's exciting. So you're gonna

114
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Be able to get some psychotherapy, maybe for the first time. That's kind of cool.

115
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:22.410
Alicia Noedel: I think that that would benefit me a lot because I did have, you know, a lot of, um, you know, alcohol, drug abuse as a child in my life. Okay.

116
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: perfect fit for this program.

117
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people with the same type of history. So you're going to hear your story, sort of, echoed in other group members to

118
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm glad you made it here. So I'm going to talk. It's an intense assessment. It's really sort of one side me asking

119
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Me asking questions, much like what the dog is doing.

120
00:13:48.630 --> 00:14:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the next time we meet will be a really nice slow sort of mellow, kind of, you know, really. Where do you want to focus your energy on and getting to know each other there but this

121
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: At 1030 is going to still it's going to still be kind of lots and lots of questions, but I'm looking forward to seeing you at 1030

122
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Same thing as you did today, go into a virtual clinic login about 1020 in the morning, say, Hey, I'm here to see what and provide a bps if you make a little note.

123
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.050
Alicia Noedel: Okay EP me one second to write that down. Absolutely.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:33.210

125
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:41.850
Alicia Noedel: Up. After this I was going to go straight to the class and do my labs for you guys.

126
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.390
Alicia Noedel: Oh, so I was more around and do all that.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.120
Dawn Abriel: That's more important, get that done. Yeah.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.720

137
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.940
Dawn Abriel: I have to make sure that

138
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:44.160
Dawn Abriel: That I write this right things in that you qualify for the program. I'm sure you've been asked all this before, but you

139
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.300
Dawn Abriel: Had to take more and more opioid to get the same effect or to not go through withdrawal rate.

140
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.000
Alicia Noedel: Correct.

141
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.580
Dawn Abriel: And did you have any overdoses.

142
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.670
Alicia Noedel: Um, before I started on a program

143
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.350
Dawn Abriel: Or ever, ever.

144
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:13.110
Alicia Noedel: Um, I mean, I would like to think not, but like no apparent overdoses. No.

145
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.640
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and no medical complications or legal issues because of the drug use.

146
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.920
Alicia Noedel: Or no, okay.

147
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.120
And

148
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:36.360
Dawn Abriel: Most people talk about spending a lot of time trying to thinking about the drug getting the drug then thinking about the next. How are you going to get the next dose. Was that part of your life.

149
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:49.020
Alicia Noedel: Yes, I was in an abusive relationship. I was a 14 when I met him, and he was 20 and I was with him for

150
00:16:50.910 --> 00:17:07.110
Alicia Noedel: Till I was 18 years old and, uh, probably when I was 16 we started to do heroin and pills and it for me it I got so latched onto it, because it helped me cope

151
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:15.210
Alicia Noedel: With the fact that he was so abusive. It helps me, you know, accept it and it helped me

152
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.950
Alicia Noedel: Kind of, you know, sweep it under the rug because

153
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:26.220
Alicia Noedel: I was sure you know very brainwashed at the time I didn't want to leave him. But I was so in pain.

154
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.720
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, by the mental the physical, verbal all of it that I'm I coped with drugs. Yeah.

155
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.920
Alicia Noedel: And I worse.

156
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.930
Dawn Abriel: And

157
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.210
Dawn Abriel: So, but your drug use, never got in the way of

158
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:43.800
Keeping a job.

159
00:17:46.110 --> 00:18:02.760
Alicia Noedel: I'm not the the drug use and the relationship both made me, you know, start putting jobs early one job that I had that I was a really good job and I was living up north in Espanola with my mother.

160
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.790
Alicia Noedel: And I was working at the Santa Clara in

161
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:21.960
Alicia Noedel: The hotel casino as a housekeeper and I was making really good money and he you know decided one day that he didn't want me living with my mom. So we, you know, packed up and left. So, you know, it was also the drugs because he

162
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:34.470
Alicia Noedel: You know, was able to get it better. Like he knew where to get it and I didn't know because he started me on it. And then he would, he would

163
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:44.010
Alicia Noedel: His prescription medication and so that fed our addiction. A lot. So I relied on him with my addiction.

164
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.090
Gotcha.

165
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:57.390
Dawn Abriel: So because of what the opioid does to the brain, it changes it so much. And because you started at such a young age.

166
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:13.500
Dawn Abriel: A lot of people describe having a you know that it causes anxiety, the drug itself. So if you had some anxiety before starting the opioid then anxiety is a prominent feature and is

167
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.400
Dawn Abriel: True for you.

168
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.010
Alicia Noedel: And yeah.

169
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.160
Dawn Abriel: And sleep.

170
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.390
Dawn Abriel: You sleep. Okay.

171
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:32.400
Alicia Noedel: Uh, yeah, I do. Um, I been having problems or I'm just, you know, obviously, I have a newborn, you know,

172
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:46.380
Alicia Noedel: Right. But even if I do you know my fiance takes the night shifts, or whatever. I just never feel lately. I have not felt rested at all. Yeah. Yep.

173
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:58.620
Dawn Abriel: And so you've never been hospitalized for a mental illness and you've not had individual therapy. What would you say your stress level is right now, mild, moderate, or severe

174
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.730
Alicia Noedel: Mild mild to moderate, you know,

175
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.440
Alicia Noedel: There varies

176
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.640
From the end

177
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:15.030
Dawn Abriel: In the stress consists of economic educational, social financial which what kind of stresses it

178
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.250
Alicia Noedel: I'm financial is a big one. I'm

179
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:35.310
Alicia Noedel: Being able to protect my child. I don't know what category that would fit into. But that's one of the most things that I worry about, especially with all the crazy things that are going on in the world today.

180
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

181
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.960
Dawn Abriel: Would you ever let your 14 year old daughter be involved with the 20 year old man.

182
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.980
No.

183
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.440
Alicia Noedel: My parents

184
00:20:50.610 --> 00:21:00.330
Alicia Noedel: My mother lived in a different state or in a different city. She lived closer to Texas. So at least like 10 hour drive away.

185
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:13.710
Alicia Noedel: And my father was newly married and he wasn't really, you know, I, I've been on my own for for a little while. Like I was on my own. When I was younger, pretty much.

186
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.900
Dawn Abriel: Yep, yep, I mean that

187
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:29.790
Dawn Abriel: The only real explanation is a parent that is not being involved not paying attention not taking it seriously. So

188
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.120
Yeah.

189
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.830
Dawn Abriel: And your self esteem right now. She say it's

190
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.340
Alicia Noedel: Um, I feel pretty good.

191
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.170
Alicia Noedel: I would say, on a scale of one to 10 it's about an eight.

192
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.550
Okay.

193
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:55.590
Dawn Abriel: All right, let's do the past medical history. So what I'm going to ask you a lot of questions and just stop me if any of them apply to you.

Alicia Noedel: And it just started happening within the past few months.

209
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:46.770
Dawn Abriel: And you've

210
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.290

221
00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:13.050
Alicia Noedel: Okay and I'm trying to think of everything you just ran through real quick. I got hybrid every now and again. But, uh, you know, I'm sure, not more than anybody else. Okay, but it does happen pretty frequently like probably you know once, twice a week.

222
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.950
Alicia Noedel: I'm trying to think. Sorry.

223
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:24.660
Alicia Noedel: I think I think anything else. You know, I don't have any crazy diseases, anything like that.

224
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.800
All right.

225
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.890
Dawn Abriel: So I'm assuming you've never had a surgery.

226
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.670
Dawn Abriel: Unless you had to have a C section.

227
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:43.530
Alicia Noedel: Um, I do. I've had my wisdom teeth surgically removed. I don't know if that counts but

228
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:50.190
Dawn Abriel: Some people counted. But I'll put it in there, but you have your tonsils in your gallbladder and you're a

229
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.000
Alicia Noedel: Brand X.

230
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.720
Alicia Noedel: Yes. All right.

231
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.530
Dawn Abriel: And not had any other surgery.

232
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.570
Dawn Abriel: And now we'll do your medicines and

233
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:06.870
Dawn Abriel: While I'm

234
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:13.710
Dawn Abriel: I would like for you to take all of your medicine this morning.

235
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.960
Dawn Abriel: Okay, take the rest of it this morning. So you get your blood level up.

236
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:25.140
Dawn Abriel: And and here's the thing, if you start getting drowsy and kind of

237
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.340
Dawn Abriel: You know, not feeling right then, then that's too much medicine.

238
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.210
Alicia Noedel: You're going to

239
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.220
Dawn Abriel: Back it down by some

240
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:44.190
Alicia Noedel: It's not really like a drowsiness, to the point where I'm like, you know, not being able to, but I am just, you know, my energy levels are very low. Yeah.

241
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:50.370
Dawn Abriel: I actually what I recommend is that you take, take the second one as soon as possible.

242
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:59.400
Dawn Abriel: This morning and wait until tomorrow morning and see how you feel, because I think you might be taking too much.

243
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.090
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

244
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:15.150
Dawn Abriel: So it's, it's worth trying. And the way I run programs is as soon as you're stable, you know, you're getting the individual therapy, you're feeling good about yourself. You're, you're solid in the program you will start tapering down

245
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:30.300
Dawn Abriel: Right buprenorphine not off. I mean, unless you want to. But you know, I don't make people come off. But I make them come down, or I really encourage them to come down to a safe medical dose, which is like

246
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:39.210
Alicia Noedel: I'm all for that, you know, I'm all for, you know, getting to a point where I don't need it anymore because that is my goal eventually

247
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:49.530
Alicia Noedel: Okay, but um you know i i i feel like I'm in, you know, we withdrawals, like I just said I don't feel

248
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:59.010
Alicia Noedel: I just, I think it's crazy that the, you know, like switching someone's medication as i've been i've had a hard time adjusting to it.

249
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.200
Alicia Noedel: Because they gave me

250
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:14.430
Alicia Noedel: Tablets. And then when I complained about the tablets, because they were making me vomit because of the taste of the orange is so prominent

251
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.140
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, some people really don't

252
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.710
Dawn Abriel: Like that.

253
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.450
Alicia Noedel: Um, they prescribed me a kind that was mint flavored

254
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:34.260
Alicia Noedel: And my insurance didn't, didn't approve it. So I had to get it changed and they decided that they were going to help me, but they gave me I'm a film instead

255
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.180
Alicia Noedel: And with the the film's the

256
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.580
Alicia Noedel: The I can't explain it. My they would make my mouth dry.

257
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:55.200
Alicia Noedel: In a, you know, like a really weird way, because the tablets. They dissolve so much different. And, you know, it would be like I was wasting the medicine and not even getting it because

258
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:10.530
Alicia Noedel: It would literally take like so long for them to dissolve. So they gave me the other ones back and you know I asked my doctor one last time I was like, you know, if you guys could please reconsider just, you know,

259
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:28.890
Alicia Noedel: Even for, you know, a month or two if you guys don't you know see an improvement or whatever, you know, whatever the case may be giving you my original medication back and they, you know, they just said we don't do that. And so

260
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.920
Dawn Abriel: I know what the original medication was

261
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.760
Alicia Noedel: Um buprenorphine normal buprenorphine eight milligram

262
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.940
Alicia Noedel: They never, I never

263
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.650
Alicia Noedel: Okay, it

264
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.600
Dawn Abriel: Does come in lot lots of manufacturers.

265
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.800
Dawn Abriel: So,

266
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:56.370

331
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:17.370

Dawn Abriel: You didn't know what is

333
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:33.990
Dawn Abriel: Available right so that's why we call it a brain disease. It's not because you're a bad person or that you you don't have any morals or willpower. It has nothing to do with that. It's what that drug does to your brain.

343
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.200
Dawn Abriel: Now,

344
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.760

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:38.460
Alicia Noedel: And I stopped smoking and now I do the I have like a vapor pen.

348
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.500
Alicia Noedel: That I

349
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.460
Alicia Noedel: I hit every now and again, but I've come off of it all along.

350
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.350
Dawn Abriel: Oh good, don't start smoking. It's just, it's

351
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:53.370
Dawn Abriel: It's so much pleasing to be putting in your body.

352
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.360
Alicia Noedel: And it was

353
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.090
Alicia Noedel: Hard for me to quit and

354
00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.700
Alicia Noedel: Ya know, why go back to it, you know.

355
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.860
Dawn Abriel: Exactly, exactly.

356
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:10.860
Dawn Abriel: And I'll tell you, being on the sub sub the buprenorphine makes it easier for you to not be smoking.

357
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.690
Alicia Noedel: Right, it

358
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:25.920
Dawn Abriel: For some reason, I mean, I have this whole campaign. I started in January to help people quit because so many people say they want to quit, but they don't they don't have the support. So I started giving them more support.

359
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.450
Alicia Noedel: Or the motivation, you know, because you saying doing is two different things.

360
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.920
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely. How about alcohol for you.

361
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.770
Alicia Noedel: I don't drink.

362
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.980

365
00:37:52.200 --> 00:38:11.040
Alicia Noedel: With her husband because her husband was a registered sex offender. And so this he needed to register his address. And they basically told her you know you either, you know, leave this guy or you move away and and so she moved away and me and my dad.

366
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.800
Alicia Noedel: Started living on our own.

367
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:33.780
Alicia Noedel: And I started to that's when my rebellion started and that's when you know all my problems began because I started to want more attention. And I also, you know, same thing, like you said, coping. Then I didn't know how to cope. So I learned to and I drink a lot. I

368
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.740
Alicia Noedel: Got sexually assaulted and all kinds of stuff because of my drinking. So I do not drink. Yeah.

400
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:11.280
Dawn Abriel: And we used to get bottled water, but I never liked the taste and I I knew as a doctor. I knew it was important to drink water, and the only way I could make myself do it.

401
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.500

403
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:24.150
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so we drink so much carbonated water. We actually my husband figured out how we can do it at home.

404
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.100
Dawn Abriel: So we had this tank.

405
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.210

Dawn Abriel: It is. It's silly expensive.

410
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.360
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, but

411
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.270
Dawn Abriel: But it was worth it to know that I

412
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.790
Dawn Abriel: I was at least drinking that

413
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.810
Dawn Abriel: Right, and you're not on a particular diet right now.

Dawn Abriel: They don't cry them all in right they crowd them into these

420
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:35.910
Dawn Abriel: tight pants. So of course they're spreading disease. So they give them the antibiotics and it stays it. Yeah, it's really ugly. I

421
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.860
Alicia Noedel: It's so the meat doesn't get get tough from them moving around too much.

422

Alicia Noedel: I'm over 13 hour days.

445
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.770
Alicia Noedel: And I wouldn't be able to do it on my own.

446
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.320
Dawn Abriel: Did you ever substitute the heroin for Creighton when you trying to get off.

447
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.650
Alicia Noedel: I don't know what that is. No. Okay.

448
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.610
Dawn Abriel: Well then you didn't do it.

449
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.070
Dawn Abriel: And tell me what you like to do for fun.

450
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:37.290
Alicia Noedel: Um, I love to read. I'm a big Bookworm I love to write. I want to be a writer. Eventually, but you know there's not a lot of money in writing, so

451
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:51.630
Alicia Noedel: I want to write an autobiography about my life so that maybe I could maybe you know my experiences and all the things that I've been through could inspire you know young girls to be

452
00:44:53.070 --> 00:45:00.570
Alicia Noedel: You know, hopeful that you know there is a future and that it's not the end of the world you know problems that you're having at the time, you know, because

453
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.130
Alicia Noedel: When you're a teenager.

454
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:09.900
Alicia Noedel: Small things or even things that aren't too small, like things that happened to you that are pretty portable feeling the end of the world.

455
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:22.950
Dawn Abriel: They feel like the end of the world. And because we didn't have the life experience of having a problem and getting over it. You can't believe that you'll get over it. Right.

456
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.540
Alicia Noedel: Right, right.

457
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:37.620
Dawn Abriel: So having really attentive parents who say, sweetheart. This, this will this will pass and will help you and tell me how you're feeling and let's see what we can do to keep busy all of those real parental things

458
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.070
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

459
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.960
Dawn Abriel: If you didn't get it and

460
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.810
Dawn Abriel: And and I encourage you to start writing the book now start making notes.

461
00:45:46.470 --> 00:46:01.680
Alicia Noedel: I have. I've been trying to write it for probably like four years. But you know, it's so I add, I think I'm pretty sure I've been diagnosed with a DD, so I have a problem with, you know, following through and things

462
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:02.940
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I didn't know that.

463
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.880
Dawn Abriel: It's not add that's the, that's the opioid and what it's what it's doing to your brain.

464
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.560
Alicia Noedel: I have like, um,

465
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:25.950
Alicia Noedel: It's been happening though like since before I I started doing opiates I've, I've had a problem with finishing projects because I've always loved to write. I liked writing poems and things like that when I was younger.

466
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.740
Alicia Noedel: I tried to write like a horror novel when I was like nine or 10 and

467
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:32.340
Dawn Abriel: You know,

468
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.100
Alicia Noedel: Obviously that's funny age but

469
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.890
Dawn Abriel: I would just encourage you that

470
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.620
Dawn Abriel: That's a worthy goal and

471
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:56.070
Dawn Abriel: You'll find that when you get your buprenorphine down to like the one or the two level everyone tells me when they get down to four, they feel like they've woken up

472
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:04.140
Dawn Abriel: Right. They have energy they feel good. They start really getting their lives tight and

473
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:16.380
Dawn Abriel: And it just gets you know better. From there, usually when they get to four. They say, Okay, I'm ready to go all the way off, and in five months or so they're, they're all the way off so

474
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:25.140
Alicia Noedel: W like the buprenorphine has helped me immensely like I gotten even explain you know

475
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.740
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I know.

476
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.660
Dawn Abriel: Thinking about I hear ya I hear it all day long. I know.

477
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:50.190
Dawn Abriel: I know from all the stories I hear it changes people's lives. It gives them time out the misery. Yeah. Now here's the thing. Um, it's not enough, right, because it does not. The buprenorphine does not rewire your brain.

478
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:57.510
Dawn Abriel: Right, it's still an opioid, it's a long acting opioids. So it's still doing some of the damage.

479
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:00.630
Dawn Abriel: That was done with the short acting opioids.

480
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:17.670
Dawn Abriel: So, but what the buprenorphine does is it gives you this time this relief from the pressure of doing the short acting opioids, so that you can get therapy, which is like a substitute for the parenting. You didn't get

481
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:18.540
Alicia Noedel: Right.

482
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:27.240
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, and it's it's very I've had a lot of trauma in my life. Dr. I've had a lot of horrible things happen to me. Um,

483
00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.460
Alicia Noedel: And they've had

484
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.300
Dawn Abriel: I believe it. I really need to get through this.

485
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:43.590
Dawn Abriel: Sorry, I mean, I'm really interested in your story. It's not from what you said it's not all that different from mine and I'm 67 years old.

486
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.080
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I didn't go to high school.

487
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:46.890
Right.

488
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.560
Dawn Abriel: And I became a doctor.

489
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:52.470
Alicia Noedel: Possible right

490
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.100
Dawn Abriel: That's right.

491
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.540

492
00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.530
