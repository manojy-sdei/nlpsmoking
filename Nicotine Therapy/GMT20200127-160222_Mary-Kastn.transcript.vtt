11
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.500
Mary Kastner: Maybe she just

12

13
00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:04.290
Mary Kastner: For discharge. I don't know what. But you're still seeing here. So I was okay with that because I want you in some kind of mental health group because

14
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.350

Genevieve Crawford: I mean taking it less. Oh, I probably still have like five or six quantifying okay

20
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.510
Mary Kastner: And so, how often do you think to take it.

21
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.350
Genevieve Crawford: probably once every two to three days.

22
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.030
Mary Kastner: Okay, once every two to three days.

23
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.320
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay. And what determines when you take it.

24
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:55.890
Genevieve Crawford: I'm just, I feel like I have like a lot of anxious thoughts that are like flooding my mind and they're not enabling me to like

25
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.770
Genevieve Crawford: Kind of like move forward in terms of like what I'm doing, or my thoughts.

26
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.540
Mary Kastner: Okay, and you can't move forward without taking

27
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:17.130
Genevieve Crawford: I mean it, it's possible but and I've been like working on like not relying on it. Um,

28
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:29.850
Genevieve Crawford: So I wouldn't say like not to hit like prohibits me from moving forward. But I feel like it's an easier way to like kind of calm and re center myself when

29
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.620
Genevieve Crawford: I've been word

30
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.430
Mary Kastner: Okay, I

31
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:36.900
Genevieve Crawford: Like that.

32
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.560

34
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:57.180
Genevieve Crawford: On that something we talked about and she's in the meditations really good with that in my discussions with third been focusing on like

35
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:04.470
Genevieve Crawford: Are you figuring out what I want and need outside of work. Like if my entire life or balance.

36
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.900
Genevieve Crawford: And how to go about doing that.

37
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:11.790
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

38
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.880
Mary Kastner: Meditation isn't going to work in the moment.

39
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:16.860
Mary Kastner: You know,

40
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:25.170
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so hopefully you know it's a daily practice so that you can not have the

41
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.160
Mary Kastner: Anxiety so often. Let's put it that way.

42
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:50.490
Genevieve Crawford: Yeah, I also wonder if it would make sense to increase the my dose of flops mean a little bit. So I've been on this dose for three months now and I definitely think that it's working. But I wonder if that may also like

43
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.750

45
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:15.120
Genevieve Crawford: Um, I think, just like in general like social anxiety in some of those like habitual negative anxious thought lives that I have, like, particularly at night, have been a lot better. Okay. Okay.

And a pulse was 52

187
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.650
Mary Kastner: So as far as the mental status exam.

188
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.270

190
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:33.810

191
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:47.160
Mary Kastner: Adequate our iOS. Only thing also since review what normal is that perhaps a little runny nose far as her diagnoses goes

192

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:32.370
Mary Kastner: She has obsessive compulsive disorder and it's she said she feels like she's less obsessive on the blue box that there was some benefit, she would like to increase it, and maybe that would assist with her not having to take the Klonopin as often and

196
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:40.860
Mary Kastner: As far as a specific phobia. She's doing better at work. So she's not so anxious about failure and

197
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.970
Why I'm not coming up with her diagnoses.

iPhone: I'm basically like

267
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.850
iPhone: I like to describe it. Like, I was like,

268
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:05.520
iPhone: I graduated high school and 2012 so that means I you know I was in there like oh eight.

269
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:28.770

270
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:35.700
iPhone: Like it was just something back then. It wasn't like I was doing it every day but

271
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.350
iPhone: Then

272
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.590
iPhone: Around when I was about like

273
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:57.000
iPhone: My stepfather was severely addicted to opiates and he asked me to go find some of them like on the street for him.

274
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:12.840
iPhone: And so I knew some friends who knew some friends and started buying large amounts of opiates for my stepfather who's no longer really in my life anymore and kind of there is when

275
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.840

321
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:33.960

751
01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.200
Mary Kastner: Okay.

752
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:15.720
Mary Kastner: Okey dokey. So tell me, I'm a little bit of your history of opioid use and how you got into

753
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.960
Mary Kastner: Getting on Suboxone way back before 2007. If you will please

754
01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:27.480
Amsnda Mayberry: Okay. Um, let's see. Well, my addiction first started out with the Aussie Cotton's

755
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:40.200
Amsnda Mayberry: Around age 1718 I use Aussies for probably, you know, a few years it was completely out of control. And after that I went to.

756
01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.130
Mary Kastner: How many a day.

757
01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.920
Amsnda Mayberry: How many 1080 milligrams

758
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.580
Mary Kastner: 1080 milligrams well

759
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:56.340
Amsnda Mayberry: Yes. Um, and then I got on Suboxone after a couple years of doing that and then

760
01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:09.270
Amsnda Mayberry: What did I do. Oh, I went back out on. Oh, I had my 16 year old, I had my son, and he you know I had a lot of birth injuries and so they put me on Percocet and Norco

761
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:21.660
Amsnda Mayberry: And, you know, so I stopped taking the Suboxone they prescribed me that after having my son, you know, and that was the beginning of me going back out again and and backup on oxidase again.

762
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:37.950
Amsnda Mayberry: Or, I think, like, a year and a half after that I went to the Methadone clinic down in Chico, California to ages. They have me on 180 milligrams method on a day. I did that for five years and then I had

763
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.490
Amsnda Mayberry: You know this big thing happened in my family.

764
01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:54.510
Amsnda Mayberry: And then after that I decided I didn't want to be on methadone anymore. And then I went back to right roads recovery and I'm a doctor. There is a doctor that did Suboxone

765
01:19:55.650 --> 01:20:00.450
Amsnda Mayberry: And I got back on Suboxone for five years and then

766
01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.230
Amsnda Mayberry: I think it was November of last year.

767
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:14.670
Amsnda Mayberry: That doctors actually arrested because he had had us on starch such huge does large doses of statics and Suboxone and I guess they like

768
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:29.100
Amsnda Mayberry: Change something or something and they're not, you know, weren't he wasn't supposed to be prescribing that and so like our middle of nowhere, our doctor, you know, my gosh, I've had for five years, it's just completely. You know, like gone and

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:36.030
Amsnda Mayberry: You know and i and i certainly after that I found out I was pregnant and you know it was just really

770
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:51.300
Amsnda Mayberry: It was a really hard time for me and then I got hooked up with Shasta community and they were able to help me, you know, get stable on Suboxone they did want me off Xanax, you know, start tapering which at first that was

771
01:20:51.960 --> 01:21:02.520
Amsnda Mayberry: Really, really hard. I honestly didn't think it was really possible but you know being pregnant and for my daughter and every thing. You know, I decided to give it a try and

772
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:08.340
Mary Kastner: God bless them. That's a great taper and chaos of it.

773

Amsnda Mayberry: I do you know I did.

774
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:14.280
Amsnda Mayberry: I do. I really do. And, you know,

775
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.590
Amsnda Mayberry: Since I was 18, you know, and I just never thought I would be able to be off statics

776
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:27.600
Amsnda Mayberry: I thought I could be yourself. But I just never thought I'd be off that so you know i'm i'm really happy about it, you know.

Mary Kastner: After the Shasta community tapered those Xanax, did you have any more to tell me about your history.

792
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.000
Mary Kastner: What happened from there.

793
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:37.320
Um,

794

Amsnda Mayberry: Well, I just community. They like require you to come in once a week, you know, and right now I don't have, you know, my vehicles broke down and everything. So it's just really hard for me to get there with my baby, you know, with no vehicle.

795
01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:00.990
Amsnda Mayberry: And, you know, that was another reason why I was so happy to be able to do you know the treatment online is, you know, I can do it from my home.

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:57.900
Mary Kastner: And do they have any alternative suggestions for the pain at the then the opioids.

1002
01:38:58.710 --> 01:38:59.100
Because

1003
01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.880
Susan Vargas: The medicine. I you said the name of

1004
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:05.190
Mary Kastner: Suboxone

1005
01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.280
Susan Vargas: Yes, about some they said it would be alternative

1006
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:12.930
Mary Kastner: Uh huh. Well Suboxone would be something you would take daily

1007
01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.840
Susan Vargas: Oh, not as needed.

1008
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:18.450
Mary Kastner: Not as needed ever say

1009
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:29.670
Mary Kastner: It's for people who have a daily addiction to opioids and in order to start Suboxone you would have to come in, withdraw, meaning you're

1010
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:32.160
Mary Kastner: In one year.

1011
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.000
Mary Kastner: Which call it attacks and

1012
01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:48.240
Mary Kastner: You were taking opioids and then you just stop it and put up with the pain and come in pretty miserable and then we'd start the Suboxone

1013
01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.070
Susan Vargas: Okay.

1014
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.730
Mary Kastner: Now, I have no problem with giving you Suboxone

1015
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.450
Mary Kastner: For you know daily treatment, but it seems like

1016
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:13.350
Mary Kastner: If you want to use it for the pain for these program for this problem you audit get Stanford just sent you to the to their pain program.

1017
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:16.110
Susan Vargas: Managers uncover stamper

1018
01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:17.580
Oh, shoot.

1019
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:28.020
Mary Kastner: I'm because there is a preparation see Suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine.

1020
01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:34.830
Mary Kastner: Which is an opioid agonist sits on the pain receptor site.

1021
01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:40.620
Mary Kastner: And naloxone, which is an antagonist.

1022
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:44.790
Mary Kastner: To prevent any overdose.

1023
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.520
Susan Vargas: Oh, I didn't know that.

1024
01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:53.430
Mary Kastner: So teen programs typically use the buprenorphine alone.

1025
01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:55.110
Mary Kastner: For pain.

1026
01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.800
Mary Kastner: We our program uses it for

1027
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:03.330
Mary Kastner: Addiction.

1028
01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:05.190
Susan Vargas: Okay.

1029
01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.020
Mary Kastner: So, um,

1030
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:20.670
Mary Kastner: What I what I probably want to do is discuss this with the medical director and see if he has any resources for you or any suggestions for us to give you

1031
01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.690
Mary Kastner: When you have this kind of issue with your stomach.

1032
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:26.160
Um,

1033
01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:29.190
Mary Kastner: Oh, poets can actually

1034
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.550

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:45.630
Susan Vargas: Yeah yeah

1090
01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:36.600

1093
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.810
Susan Vargas: A lot

1094
01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:49.980
Mary Kastner: You have a lot. Okay, so when I would recommend is that you try to get as sooner appointment with him.

1095
01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:57.240
Mary Kastner: Okay, if you can't come back to us for mental health treatment and stop seeing him. How long have you

1096
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:58.260
Mary Kastner: Been seeing him.

1097
01:44:59.910 --> 01:45:10.980
Susan Vargas: A few months that I really, we don't get along at all. He just argues with me. He didn't even want to put me on antidepressants. He didn't want to change it. Even though all my doctor suggested that they change it to some balls. I had to fight him on it.

1098
01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:15.750
Susan Vargas: And get doctor's notes from a few doctors just for him to change it. Okay.

1099
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:26.190
Mary Kastner: So what I would recommend is it, you know, you have to make a decision whether you continue to see him, or if you want us to take over that medication for you.

1100
01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.040
Susan Vargas: I'd rather you guys take over. Okay.

1101
01:45:29.130 --> 01:45:34.560
Mary Kastner: So what I would recommend since you have a lot of those left is that we go up to

01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:40.260
Mary Kastner: Two of those and what time of day are you taking it.

1103
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:41.400

02:02:51.570 --> 02:02:54.420

02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:20.400
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1305
02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:36.480
iPad: Well, not without the medicine. I tell you, it's made them very big difference. They were under medicating me and I begged them I begged them at NAP for pain for more medicine.

1306
02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:47.010
iPad: And they kept saying, no, not at this office you aren't gonna get that and I sold them in August. I told them unless you

iPad: meaningful life. And that was all ended when they reduce me below 160 milligrams of oxy cotton a day and I'm having been the same. And I'm trying to get my life back. And this has been a worst year of my life.

1310
02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.400
iPad: Honestly, to camp.

1311
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:47.820
iPad: I lost my mom in June and I lost my brother in October and it's been a hard. I haven't even been able to

1312
02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:52.740
iPad: Give my brother a service, you know,

1313
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:57.240
iPad: In his passing, because I've been so sick.

1314
02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:11.730

Mary Kastner: And what is it a film or a pill.

1319
02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:29.640
Pill

1320
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.440
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1321
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:33.060
Mary Kastner: And

1322
02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:35.910
Mary Kastner: It's a pill form. And what's the dosage.

1323
02:07:37.170 --> 02:07:45.450
iPad: Well, right now. They got me on eight mil grams two milligrams four times a day.

1324
02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:47.820
Mary Kastner: Okay, and it's not holding you

1325
02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:53.010
iPad: It's sometimes but you know

1326
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:59.760
iPad: IT'S THERE ARE TIMES I'M REALLY IN VERY MUCH PAIN.

1327
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:22.020
iPad: But it's may I'm making progress, big progress compared to what I was, I felt like that I was going to die out. Honestly, I, I don't think these people who are regulating this drug relay right realize

1328
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:35.070
iPad: What harm, it's doing to people like me who have been on high doses. For years I was on 880 milligrams of

1329
02:08:40.650 --> 02:08:40.920
iPad: Know,

1330
02:08:47.070 --> 02:08:53.910
iPad: oxy cotton 80 milligrams four times a day for over 10 years

1331
02:08:54.810 --> 02:08:55.410
iPad: And I got

1332
02:08:55.770 --> 02:09:00.480
iPad: Cut down to 180 milligrams a day and that

1333
02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:00.900
Mary Kastner: My

1334
02:09:01.230 --> 02:09:13.920
iPad: My body can't adjust to that I tried for a year. You know, I know. I was in a constant state of withdrawal and pain for a year and the pain was unbelievable.

1335
02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:17.940
Mary Kastner: And you on 84 times a day for how long.

1336
02:09:18.930 --> 02:09:21.060
iPad: Since 2007

1337
02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.510
iPad: Over 10 years

1338
02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:27.000
Mary Kastner: And

1339
02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:54.630
iPad: It's been a horror. It's just been over nightmare and there was no medical reason for me to go off them, you know, the doctor who took me off it. He knew, you know, the problem with my blood pressure because I had had high blood pressure and but that that oxy cotton allowed me to

1340
02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:15.450
iPad: Eat properly exercise carry on a normal life and that helped keep my blood pressure down, you know, not in the stratosphere, but once they started reducing me my blood pressure went through the roof.

1341
02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:38.610
iPad: He kept reducing me, he said, kept saying, you're the only one in this practice, who is taking this much medicine and he gleefully reduced me and and then and then kick me out of the practice, you know,

1342
02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:41.310
Mary Kastner: It is not appropriate, and

1343
02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:43.650
Mary Kastner: It was OK. OK.

1344
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:44.850
Mary Kastner: So let's get back

1345
02:10:44.850 --> 02:11:04.710
Mary Kastner: To the Suboxone and we definitely can give you 32 milligrams a day, we're not allowed by law to give over that and you would be the only one in my practice on that higher dose and that higher dose is normal for people that have pain disorder.

1346
02:11:07.530 --> 02:11:12.900
Mary Kastner: So I, I could do that for you. What other medications are you on

1347
02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:18.870
iPad: Okay, I'm aspirin, two times a day.

1348
02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:26.610
iPad: Nexium for my stomach once a day and

1349
02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.030
iPad: Gosh.

1350
02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:38.130
iPad: Oh, I have a minor

1351
02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:48.120
iPad: Cholesterol drug and I can't think of the name of it. That's all.

1352
02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:49.920
iPad: Okay.

1353
02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:51.600
Mary Kastner: Anything for blood pressure.

1354
02:11:52.290 --> 02:12:10.260
iPad: No, I. That's the other problem. I've tried for years, all the blood pressure, medicine, there is and I can't tolerate it. And it also does not bring down my blood pressure appreciably

1355
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:12.060
iPad: And yeah.

1356
02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:13.350
Mary Kastner: That's it.

1357
02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:16.080
Mary Kastner: Do you have a primary care physician right now.

1358
02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:24.450
iPad: No, I have one, but she isn't working out for me really

1359
02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.310
Mary Kastner: Are you going to continue to see this person Martinez.

1360
02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.040
iPad: No, he's a or emergency doctor

1361
02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:46.800
Mary Kastner: Oh, I see. Okay. Um, so you need, you know, requirement of our program will be that you get a primary care physician and you at least have an annual physical

1362
02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:49.680
Mary Kastner: So think about that.

1363
02:12:51.090 --> 02:12:53.910
Mary Kastner: I have some blood work that I've ordered for you.

1364
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:56.130
iPad: Hey, I had that

1365
02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:59.400
iPad: I had that done Friday.

1366
02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:01.260

iPad: And I hope you get it soon, but it didn't go well.

iPad: They jacked me three times before they got another blood and I never have had to have lab work before. What would you checking for

Mary Kastner: Um, it's general chemical panel, including for

1372
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:38.880
Mary Kastner: Hepatitis and liver function because of the use of the opioids.

1373
02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:49.080
Mary Kastner: urine drug screen general your analysis. They also test for things like infectious diseases like syphilis.

2005
03:03:54.210 --> 03:04:05.070
Talyssa: And she. It was the film still. And so that was a we. It was a little bit of confusion. They're like, No, this is all we have on file. And I'm like, Are you sure because that's fine. Of course, but

2006
03:04:06.180 --> 03:04:17.700
Talyssa: We were supposed to, you know, switch or whatever. And so they said, come back in like two hours they said they called your office and that was that that was the plan so they gave the tablets instead

2007
03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:29.010
Talyssa: But they are literally. They are like, this big. They're. They're huge. I was like, gagging and I didn't tell anything like

2008
03:04:29.490 --> 03:04:42.570
Talyssa: Tell my mom or anyone. So I was just like in here trying to like let it dissolve and they were huge. So I'm so glad they gave the films as well because I switched back to the films like that night. Oops, got in my hair.

2009
03:04:43.770 --> 03:04:51.840
Talyssa: Because the tablets are literally I couldn't do it. And so it kind of came out and I was like trying to relax myself and I tried to put it back.

2010
03:04:52.320 --> 03:05:00.270
Talyssa: They were this thick and it says on there's don't break down or cut them or anything so that one just didn't work out but

2011
03:05:01.080 --> 03:05:18.120
Talyssa: Do you remember how like I had to pay and everything and the insurance was like an issue they when they gave these ones, I guess, I guess that was only the case for the generic ones. So since they gave the actual Suboxone the, the real, the real manufactured ones, they were being

2012
03:05:19.170 --> 03:05:20.040
Mary Kastner: buprenorphine.

2013
03:05:21.180 --> 03:05:21.570
Talyssa: Yeah, those

2014
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:24.480
Mary Kastner: Are being without the

2015
03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:25.620
Talyssa: naloxone

2016
03:05:26.190 --> 03:05:27.240
Mary Kastner: Yeah, the templates. I

2017
03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:42.840
Talyssa: Had to pay for. But when I first got there, they said that the films were ready. And so that's what I first picked up those ones were just free. I guess when they run it through the real ones, not the generic it my insurance covers. So it all kind of worked out a little better. I think

2018
03:05:43.290 --> 03:05:47.940
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okay, so what is your insurance covering the tablet or the film.

2019
03:05:48.330 --> 03:05:51.810
Talyssa: The film, the real the actual one, not the generic

2020
03:05:53.370 --> 03:06:03.330
Talyssa: I feel like the long. I know. And they didn't even tell me until this is the second time I paid and then the Torah form and we've just been, I've been going back and forth with them. I guess they knew all along.

2021
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:12.540
Talyssa: So that's what they finally but every time I go I talked to someone else and they kind of like say something else and they have like a different

2022
03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:23.490
Talyssa: Kind of like, get it personality. Yeah. Like, either they don't know or it's like I have to re explain it, but that's fine. Now that it's the third I think that was the set. Oh, the second time.

2023
03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:32.940
Talyssa: So this will be the third, um, they're starting to like know me and recognize me and know about the history of the chart and stuff. So it's been getting a little easier.

2024
03:06:34.320 --> 03:06:37.800
Mary Kastner: What tell me the reason we switched to the tablet.

2025
03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:39.810
Talyssa: Was it was because my stomach.

2026
03:06:40.560 --> 03:06:45.630
Mary Kastner: Yeah, did not have been the locks on and sometimes people can tolerate that better.

2027
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:47.880
Mary Kastner: Or you know tolerating the film.

2028
03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:51.660
Talyssa: Yeah, especially the generic ones.

2029
03:06:52.770 --> 03:07:02.190
Talyssa: I'm not saying they're different, but I think they're a little bit because the actual Suboxone ones. It doesn't feel like really anything and they dissolve like

2030
03:07:02.910 --> 03:07:03.930
Talyssa: Way fast. Yeah.

2031
03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:05.070
Talyssa: Why, yeah.

2032
03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:07.290
Mary Kastner: Why you prefer this

2033
03:07:07.290 --> 03:07:07.920
Talyssa: Film

2034
03:07:08.820 --> 03:07:09.570
Yeah, and

2035
03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:14.010
Mary Kastner: So you're not getting the nausea with the film.

2036
03:07:14.370 --> 03:07:19.950
Talyssa: No, no, not pretty much all week, unless it was only a body getting used to it, but

2037
03:07:20.610 --> 03:07:21.300
Mary Kastner: I'm thinking

2038
03:07:22.890 --> 03:07:24.000
Talyssa: Okay, so

2039
03:07:24.030 --> 03:07:30.990
Mary Kastner: It was an initial side effect that went away. So tell me what the bottle of the film says as far as

2040
03:07:32.370 --> 03:07:33.930
Mary Kastner: The name of the medications.

2041
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.410
Talyssa: Right here.

2042
03:07:49.980 --> 03:07:52.350
Talyssa: Paper for the other one too. So I could actually see

2043
03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:14.070
Talyssa: Oh, it's just called Suboxone but the generic one. It says buprenorphine slash naloxone as the actual type name and then the actual one is actually called Suboxone

2044
03:08:15.420 --> 03:08:16.050
Mary Kastner: Which one

2045
03:08:16.410 --> 03:08:18.090
Mary Kastner: Which one do you like better.

2046
03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:25.350
Talyssa: Um, the actual, the one that they they gave that was free. It's an actual

2047
03:08:28.410 --> 03:08:29.040
Talyssa: Yeah.

2048
03:08:29.550 --> 03:08:32.250
Mary Kastner: So does a bottle on that say Suboxone

2049
03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:40.020
Talyssa: Yeah, it says actual word and then the generic one. It says buprenorphine. It just says ingredients, basically.

2050
03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:41.220
Mary Kastner: Yeah yeah

2051
03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:44.820
Mary Kastner: You can also telling. You're telling me you want the Suboxone

2052
03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:49.080
Talyssa: I would if I could, yeah okay um

2053
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:50.490
Mary Kastner: How many you have left.

2054
03:08:51.210 --> 03:08:51.630
Talyssa: I think

2055
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:56.940
Talyssa: I think two or three

2056
03:08:58.320 --> 03:08:58.920
Talyssa: Oh my elbow.

Talyssa: Um, it's been better. I noticed this week this past week. Well, because like the first week it was like a party. We were like celebrating guy was kind of in denial still like I couldn't believe it, but now it's more like realistic.

2127
03:12:54.690 --> 03:13:02.910
Talyssa: Since I feel so good. Like my life doesn't match it yet, like now I have all this free time. I don't have to worry we have so much more money.

2128
03:13:03.450 --> 03:13:07.770
Talyssa: We're spending like four or 500 a week just for online for pills like

2129
03:13:08.610 --> 03:13:22.560
Talyssa: So we've been trying to take the kids out more and stuff. And it's been going so good, but now I'm trying to figure out, like, do I want to go back to school. Do I want to get a draw. Do I want to work in MY MOM'S HOME daycare or, you know, so it's been a lot of like

2130
03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:31.020
Talyssa: Planning thinking a little bit more anxiety. Just because now I'm almost bored. Like you wake up. I keep cleaning everything

2131
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:34.380
Talyssa: So now it's been just like

2132
03:13:35.550 --> 03:13:40.680
Talyssa: How I feel like some waiting for something. I don't know. It's hard to explain but like I'm finally

2133
03:13:41.730 --> 03:13:44.370
Talyssa: Free from my body and I can just get up and go

Mary Kastner: Or non reactive antigen. So there is a vaccine. Now for happy and it's a series of

2166
03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:32.040
Mary Kastner: Three. So when you see your primary care you need to tell them you had no antigen for be but it was positive, it was reactive. Okay.

2167
03:15:32.370 --> 03:15:33.990
Talyssa: Write that down, actually, because

2168
03:15:37.140 --> 03:15:39.720
Mary Kastner: You had a reactive for a and b.

2169
03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:43.290
Mary Kastner: But you had no antigen

2170
03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:43.890
Would be

2171
03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:51.180
Mary Kastner: It's a series of three, I believe, vaccines.

2172
03:15:52.290 --> 03:15:56.040
Talyssa: Reactive for be but no and managing

2173
03:15:57.870 --> 03:15:58.260
Mary Kastner: A

2174
03:16:06.750 --> 03:16:08.280
Mary Kastner: They didn't test for the image and

2175
03:16:11.730 --> 03:16:13.080
Mary Kastner: So it tells me

2176
03:16:16.260 --> 03:16:21.930
Mary Kastner: That you had an exposure, probably through something some food handling someplace.

2177
03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:23.400
Talyssa: Huh. Okay.

2178
03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:30.090
Talyssa: Yeah, I'll tell them I told them from what I could recall, but I didn't pressure say that

2179
03:16:31.170 --> 03:16:31.800
Can you had

2180
03:16:32.940 --> 03:16:43.500
Mary Kastner: You have a bit of blood in your urine. I don't know if you run your man sees when they took that and there were some bacteria. So it may want to check you for urinary tract infection.

2181
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.910
Talyssa: T

2182
03:16:50.370 --> 03:16:56.790

2183
03:16:56.850 --> 03:17:01.440
Talyssa: Yeah, because I did recently have it, but I don't know what I'll just tell them anyways it's not gonna hurt.

03:20:40.980 --> 03:20:42.960

2237
03:20:43.410 --> 03:20:44.070
You thought a

2238
03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:47.490
Mary Kastner: Little bit anxious anxiety.

2239
03:20:49.110 --> 03:21:03.480
Mary Kastner: Speech rate volume coherent normal compresses appropriate rage and development normal content logical non tangential negotiations or delusions noted in insight and self reflection on today's issues noted is adequate.

2240
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:07.080
Mary Kastner: Um, can you take your pulse for me.

2241
03:21:07.380 --> 03:21:12.180

2242
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:37.230
Talyssa: It was 20. Exactly. So I think that's

2243
03:21:37.260 --> 03:21:37.620
A

2244
03:21:38.700 --> 03:21:39.030
Talyssa: Yeah.

2245
03:21:40.260 --> 03:21:40.800
Talyssa: We're 20

2246
03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:42.270
Talyssa: Seconds. Yeah.

2247
03:21:42.510 --> 03:21:46.860
Mary Kastner: You did okay at Okay super. And no withdrawal symptoms.

2248
03:21:47.820 --> 03:21:50.070
Mary Kastner: Know. Hey, um,

2249
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:58.110
Mary Kastner: Any physical problems that you're concerned about any any cold or flu.

2250
03:22:00.120 --> 03:22:00.570
Mary Kastner: ation

2251
03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:10.020
Talyssa: A little bit. I've noticed, but I don't think it's a problem. I just noticed it, it is more that way than just the normal

2252
03:22:12.270 --> 03:22:22.920
Talyssa: Yeah, I don't know. I don't think it's the problem right now because I know sometimes it could like hurt or be couple days, but it's I just noticed it is more towards that than normal, but it's not really okay

2253
03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:27.270
Mary Kastner: Okay, well, if it gets to be more like, you know, three days.

2254
03:22:27.690 --> 03:22:28.950
Mary Kastner: Then you're going to need to take

2255
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:29.610
Mary Kastner: Something

2256
03:22:30.210 --> 03:22:39.780
Mary Kastner: Okay try something like citrus cell would you can get over the counter or mirror Laxmi relax may give you a tiny bit of cramping. So I would take a quarter.

2257
03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:40.080
Talyssa: To half

2258
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:41.070
Mary Kastner: Teaspoon in

2259
03:22:42.270 --> 03:22:43.260
Talyssa: Like a down to

2260
03:22:44.100 --> 03:22:52.530
Mary Kastner: Even four ounces of water with maybe a quarter to a half a teaspoon a mirror lags because I'm opioids tend to constipated.

2261
03:22:55.380 --> 03:22:56.580
Talyssa: The last time we want

2262
03:22:56.850 --> 03:22:57.900
Mary Kastner: Bow obstruction.

2263
03:22:58.410 --> 03:23:00.150
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay.

2264
03:23:00.660 --> 03:23:05.760
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okey dokey. So the diagnosis continues to be

2265
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:08.940
Mary Kastner: opioid dependence and

2266
03:23:16.890 --> 03:23:19.200
Mary Kastner: I was saying it was was severe

2267
03:23:21.060 --> 03:23:30.150
Mary Kastner: And now we're treating doing well with treating it with an agonist. Our objective is abstinence, there has been no use. Correct.

2268
03:23:30.180 --> 03:23:31.530
Talyssa: No, then you know us

2269
03:23:31.710 --> 03:23:32.880
Mary Kastner: Nothing about craving.

2270
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:34.110
Talyssa: And even talked to them.

2271
03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:54.150
Talyssa: I'm not craving that I just noticed. Like sometimes like I realized like, Something's missing, like, or I forgot something. Or I think I'm getting used to it. More lifestyle wise but It disgusts me so no craving or what do you, what do you mean by that, like I just

2272
03:23:55.170 --> 03:23:55.620
Mary Kastner: I would say

2273
03:23:56.280 --> 03:23:59.400
Mary Kastner: It drains your thoughts of going to get

2274
03:24:00.060 --> 03:24:00.750
Oh,

2275
03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:05.250
Talyssa: Ok ok ok super

2276
03:24:05.760 --> 03:24:10.020
Mary Kastner: And how the fibromyalgia is kinda controlled because you're not

2277
03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:12.420
Talyssa: Painful Yeah Okay super.

2278
03:24:12.720 --> 03:24:17.370
Mary Kastner: So diagnoses and the objective is low, no cravings.

2279
03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:18.630
Comfort

2280
03:24:19.770 --> 03:24:20.190
Mary Kastner: And

2281
03:24:21.330 --> 03:24:26.190
Mary Kastner: Abstinence and we're meeting all of those objectives suicide thoughts.

2282
03:24:27.210 --> 03:24:29.070
Talyssa: Nothing even in the category.

2283
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:40.350
Mary Kastner: Okay and suicide risk assessment remains low. So I would say we're going to keep you on this buprenorphine. How long were you using the pain meds six or seven years trying to

2284
03:24:40.380 --> 03:24:40.800
Yeah.

2285
03:24:41.940 --> 03:24:42.780
Talyssa: 37

2286
03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:44.730
Mary Kastner: Yeah, terrible

2287
03:24:45.270 --> 03:24:50.430
Mary Kastner: I would like to keep you on it buprenorphine for a good nine months and then we can talk about

2288
03:24:50.430 --> 03:24:51.900
Talyssa: Tabor okay

2289
03:24:52.620 --> 03:25:00.180
Mary Kastner: Okay, and you've gotten your labs, they will continue to send you a urine drug screen test in the mail and they'll

2290
03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:05.610
Mary Kastner: Take the directions for that you will check into group about 15 minutes early.

2291
03:25:06.390 --> 03:25:07.260
Mary Kastner: From funding.

2292
03:25:07.860 --> 03:25:14.310
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so then you do a survey. And I don't know, to tell you the truth, how often you do that survey, maybe each time.

2293
03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:17.160
Mary Kastner: Okay. And then I think the urine drug screen is

2294
03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:17.730
Monthly

2295
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:19.710
Talyssa: Okay, well that's

2296
03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:20.460
Talyssa: Good.

2297
03:25:20.490 --> 03:25:27.180
Mary Kastner: I won't see you independently for an individual appointment, you'll be seeing me in group at once a month.

2298
03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:28.560
Talyssa: Okay.

2299
03:25:29.190 --> 03:25:32.910
Mary Kastner: There will be occasional groups. I'll be in a month that I'll be in twice but

2300
03:25:34.380 --> 03:25:36.330
Mary Kastner: I believe next month. It's once a month.

2301
03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:47.640
Mary Kastner: I'll be in the group tonight and I'll be in next Monday. And then I refilled. Like I said earlier, for four days and

2302
03:25:48.990 --> 03:25:50.490
Mary Kastner: I'll refill again on Monday.

2303
03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:52.980
Mary Kastner: Okay, so any questions for me.

2304
03:25:53.880 --> 03:26:00.090
Talyssa: Um no I but I so I make an appointment for a one on one, also for next Monday.

2305
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.960

2315
03:26:21.540 --> 03:26:28.650

2316
03:26:28.890 --> 03:26:33.210
Mary Kastner: Um, so I wouldn't say disorder process. This

2317

2318
03:26:36.210 --> 03:26:36.690
Mary Kastner: Like

Mary Kastner: Yeah, that that higher doses at higher doses. But one thing that we might do is go up to three of those half a milligram pills. So that's 1.5

2476
03:45:43.680 --> 03:45:48.780
Mary Kastner: Milligrams at bedtime, to see if that early morning anxiety is any better.

2477
03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:55.500
Mary Kastner: And then keep doing the ad event like you're doing one in the morning and half at night.

2478
03:45:56.880 --> 03:45:57.210
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2479
03:45:58.530 --> 03:46:02.400
Mary Kastner: And remember your exercises in your book. Okay.

2480
03:46:02.940 --> 03:46:03.360
Um,

2481
03:46:05.280 --> 03:46:07.230
Bill: Well, that's what I was kind of thinking

2482
03:46:08.370 --> 03:46:13.590
Bill: Maybe that's why I get so anxious and stuff. Because when I wake up, maybe it is from those pills.

2483
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:16.290
Mary Kastner: No, you were

2484
03:46:16.350 --> 03:46:18.510
Mary Kastner: You're having that from beforehand.

2485
03:46:20.100 --> 03:46:22.830
Mary Kastner: That's been your main complaint all along. Yeah.

2486
03:46:24.300 --> 03:46:29.340
Mary Kastner: Tell me, do you have very many of those Risperdal left. Do you need to refill.

2487
03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:30.360
Bill: Thank you.

2488
03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:39.330
Bill: Are you said last time you were going to put in, we get more of those, you said last time you were going to put in

2489
03:46:43.230 --> 03:46:46.380
Bill: That's where as a fan. We got 45 of those

2490
03:46:46.590 --> 03:46:47.130
Mary Kastner: Aha.

2491
03:46:47.160 --> 03:46:49.980
Bill: Put in last time you got those did we

2492
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:53.550
Bill: Know he's gonna go check and see how many we have.

2493
03:46:53.640 --> 03:47:00.660
Mary Kastner: Okay, of the Risperdal. It looks like I put in an order for respite on the 13th of January.

2494
03:47:00.750 --> 03:47:02.970
Bill: One day, wasn't it. Oh.

2495
03:47:03.060 --> 03:47:05.940
Mary Kastner: 13th 13th of January.

2496
03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:08.820
Bill: I didn't. Okay, that's the one I'm using now I think

2497
03:47:08.880 --> 03:47:11.250
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and I want to know how many you have left.

2498
03:47:13.800 --> 03:47:15.510
Bill: Yeah, he went to. He went to get it.

2499
03:47:15.900 --> 03:47:33.540
Mary Kastner: Okay, and then we'll find out because we if we increase to three half milligrams, then what I if you if I refill it. I could give you a milligram. And then you could take one and a half of those instead of taking three half milligrams makes sense.

2500
03:47:35.940 --> 03:47:42.600
Bill: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, let's see. I don't know how many for sure. Okay.

2501
03:47:43.020 --> 03:47:44.520
Mary Kastner: What's today's date today.

2502
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:48.240
Bill: January 23 you

2503
03:47:48.270 --> 03:47:49.050
Mary Kastner: Know that because you're

2504
03:47:50.190 --> 03:47:54.120
Mary Kastner: Okay and focusing concentration any better.

2505
03:47:54.120 --> 03:47:55.080
Mary Kastner: Than before

2506
03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:00.330
Mary Kastner: Are you able to read a book.

2507
03:48:00.330 --> 03:48:01.110
Mary Kastner: Now, or

2508
03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:06.420
Mary Kastner: Something happened. I lost your video.

2509
03:48:07.890 --> 03:48:08.760
Yeah, I think that

2510
03:48:09.840 --> 03:48:13.140
Bill: Oh, I see that. Are you there. Are you there now.

2511
03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:15.900
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I'm here, I can see you now.

2512
03:48:16.380 --> 03:48:18.450
Bill: Yeah, okay. I don't know what that was.

2513
03:48:20.190 --> 03:48:20.700
Bill: One.

2514
03:48:22.110 --> 03:48:23.910
Mary Kastner: Okay. There's how many left bill.

2515
03:48:24.390 --> 03:48:26.670
Bill: Oh, oh, oh.

2516
03:48:28.680 --> 03:48:29.640
Bill: There's a refill on it.

2517
03:48:30.030 --> 03:48:32.070
Mary Kastner: Okay, but how many pills are in the bottle.

2518
03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:36.810
Mary Kastner: Oh, it's full. Okay, so then we're not going to refill it.

2519
03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:43.200
Bill: No, no, there's only 12 pills left

2520
03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:45.630
Bill: And there's refill on it.

2521
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:48.300
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okay. So then how about

2522
03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:51.300
Mary Kastner: If you just experiment in

2523
03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:53.820
Mary Kastner: Pills at bedtime.

2524
03:48:55.980 --> 03:48:58.320
Mary Kastner: That's only going to give you four days.

2525
03:48:59.580 --> 03:49:00.960
Mary Kastner: With the 12 left

2526
03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:07.200
Mary Kastner: And then you can call in and tell us how that's working for you.

2527
03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:11.700
Mary Kastner: If it's changed that early morning anxiety.

2528
03:49:12.990 --> 03:49:16.740
Mary Kastner: Because you would need a refill before I see you again next week.

2529
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:36.030
Mary Kastner: If it's working for you, then I would call in the refill of a one milligram tablet, instead of having you refill this existing prescription. I would have a call in a one milligram that you would take one and a half at night, rather than three. Okay.

2530
03:49:37.350 --> 03:49:40.140
Bill: Or were you just all into would

2531
03:49:40.620 --> 03:49:54.720
Mary Kastner: You call into the front desk and tell them to give Marissa message that the three half milligrams in bed time improved or the symptoms in the morning or it stayed the same.

2532
03:49:55.800 --> 03:49:59.040
Bill: Okay. All right. And if it stayed the same. They

2533
03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:05.760
Mary Kastner: Stayed the same. Then just go ahead, back to the to at bedtime and refill that bottle.

2534
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:10.290
Mary Kastner: Okay, make sense. Yeah, okay, good.

2535
03:50:11.580 --> 03:50:20.370
Mary Kastner: Okey dokey. So are you able to read a book or focus on a TV show or focus on TV. Pretty good. Okay, okay. No.

2536
03:50:21.930 --> 03:50:25.200
Bill: Okay. So, depends on what's on. Yeah.

2537
03:50:25.770 --> 03:50:29.940
Mary Kastner: Okay so functional independence oriented.

2538
03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:45.360
Mary Kastner: Able to focus and concentrate on TV shows mood is still slightly depressed and anxious, but improved aspect is full, you were on time well groomed.

2539
03:50:47.280 --> 03:51:05.160
Mary Kastner: Appeared stated age, even though I think you look younger, younger than stated age speech rate and volume coherent and normal thought process appropriate and are you still having that kind of out of body like you're looking at yourself from outside here. Yeah, still sometimes

2540
03:51:05.280 --> 03:51:06.870
Bill: Not as bad, but yeah.

2541
03:51:07.380 --> 03:51:12.660
Mary Kastner: depersonalization has improved and that's good. And I think that's a Risperdal. That's great. Now,

2542
03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:15.450
Mary Kastner: Inside of the that

2543
03:51:16.080 --> 03:51:18.900
Mary Kastner: That it's a major tranquilizer.

2544
03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:31.230
Mary Kastner: Just like you know, remember I told you the minor tranquilizers like advantage are addictive majors or not. So it will help with the anxiety, but not be addicted.

2545
03:51:32.040 --> 03:51:42.690
Mary Kastner: Insight and self reflection issues noted is adequate. How about you feeling fine physically any symptoms of cold or flu or trouble breathing any heart problems.

2546
03:51:43.350 --> 03:51:57.960
Mary Kastner: No NOTHING NEW ONE AND ALSO SAYS reviewed is normal. OK, so the specific phobia, you still thinking that maybe you're not gonna live till the end of the year.

2547
03:52:00.150 --> 03:52:05.910
Mary Kastner: Dad's gonna happen. Still some thoughts, but you're not. Are you having them as frequently

2548
03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:11.550
Bill: I'm having a lot today because it's my birthday.

2549
03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:15.330
Mary Kastner: Today, today, is it

2550
03:52:17.040 --> 03:52:17.430
Bill: No.

2551
03:52:18.060 --> 03:52:18.570
Symptoms.

2552
03:52:20.730 --> 03:52:36.060
Mary Kastner: Visit this the the thoughts lesson generalized anxiety disorder worse in the morning. Morning, so there's a diurnal variation of anxiety objective would be that we would get that anxious feeling down below five at least

2553
03:52:36.420 --> 03:52:44.220
Mary Kastner: Yeah, however, panic disorder with Al Gore phobia has greatly increase in that you've gone out quite a bit. This week I'm just

2554
03:52:44.250 --> 03:52:45.300
Mary Kastner: Thinking about that.

2555
03:52:45.630 --> 03:52:53.460
Mary Kastner: Yeah yeah and suicide risk assessment remains the low. So our plan is to increase the risk for doll.

2556
03:52:53.940 --> 03:53:06.900
Mary Kastner: To 1.5 milligrams at bedtime. So that for you would be three of the half a milligram tablets you to call in before you run out of those to tell me if that's doing anything. So we know where we're going to go ahead and do

2557
03:53:08.280 --> 03:53:16.110
Mary Kastner: You would call in, I would say maybe in three days say tell me you know my morning anxieties better or the same

2558
03:53:17.490 --> 03:53:26.550
Mary Kastner: It fits better. I'm going to call in a new prescription that you will take one and a half taps instead of three of the little ones can you

2559
03:53:28.230 --> 03:53:28.950
Mary Kastner: Say that again.

2560
03:53:30.060 --> 03:53:31.410
Bill: He wants to know if you can let them.

2561
03:53:32.370 --> 03:53:34.530
Bill: Know, yes I have. I don't think he can

2562
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:37.380
Mary Kastner: Because they really tiny. Yeah.

2563
03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:58.410
Mary Kastner: But Bill. If you prefer not to cut them. I would say just tell Mary, you know, not to refill on a new will just refill the existing and you continue with three small ones at bedtime. If you prefer not to cut them. That's totally your choice.

2564
03:53:58.560 --> 03:53:59.640
Bill: Well, they're not

2565
03:54:00.690 --> 03:54:04.920
Bill: Realizing over hard. Yeah, they're hard coded as you wander.

2566
03:54:05.010 --> 03:54:05.310
Oh,

2567
03:54:07.740 --> 03:54:18.570
Mary Kastner: Yeah, typically the tablet of the restored. All you cut but that's a good good thought, maybe it's more of a pain. Take to cut it than it is to take three small and so

2568
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:24.870
Mary Kastner: You want to just scratch that plan and take three small ones and then we'll talk on Monday.

2569
03:54:26.280 --> 03:54:38.730
Mary Kastner: Does that make sense. Yeah, okay. You don't need to worry about a new prescription, but you're going to have to refill that one because you, it seems like you only have four days left. If you increase the dose to three.

2570
03:54:40.530 --> 03:54:42.720
Mary Kastner: So I'm going to have to let the pharmacy, you know,

2571
03:54:44.250 --> 03:54:46.320
Mary Kastner: Because they'll say you're refilling too early.

2572
03:54:48.630 --> 03:54:51.030
Mary Kastner: So you're probably going to have to call me anyway.

2573
03:54:55.980 --> 03:54:56.790
Mary Kastner: Don't make sense.

2574
03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:01.080
Mary Kastner: Since last week. Yeah, we started that

2575
03:55:01.290 --> 03:55:01.650
Yeah.

2576
03:55:02.670 --> 03:55:02.880
Bill: Was

2577
03:55:04.380 --> 03:55:04.830
Bill: No.

2578
03:55:05.970 --> 03:55:17.100
Mary Kastner: Dude, dude, I'm thinking I'm gonna have to call in a new one anyway because they're gonna say you have you know that you're taking. You're an early refill.

2579
03:55:18.420 --> 03:55:25.590
Mary Kastner: So let's do that. Let me call it in at one and a half asked him to give you a pill cutter. Do you have a pill cutter.

2580
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:27.300
Mary Kastner: We do. Okay.

2581
03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:34.800
Mary Kastner: If you don't, you know, you could ask the pharmacist when you pick it up. Are these easy to cut

2582
03:55:36.390 --> 03:55:42.810
Mary Kastner: And if she says, or he says no will then tell them you prefer to get three of the half milligrams

2583
03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:44.940
Mary Kastner: A day

2584
03:55:46.050 --> 03:55:47.850
Mary Kastner: You can make that decision.

2585
03:55:51.390 --> 03:55:55.080
Mary Kastner: Pharmacist, you know, as long as he has the correct dosing

2586
03:55:56.490 --> 03:56:01.170
Mary Kastner: That's all he needs which I'm going to call. I'm going to put in the correct dosing right now.

2587
03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:06.210
Bill: Why could be here. He didn't

2588
03:56:06.210 --> 03:56:13.380
Bill: Care. I'm getting confused on changing the original. You said you were going to turn it around.

2589
03:56:14.730 --> 03:56:15.180
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

2590
03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:16.500
Mary Kastner: Well, I

2591
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:24.510
Mary Kastner: I forgot the original prescription said something different than what you're doing. So I have to call it in anyway.

2592
03:56:26.610 --> 03:56:28.710
Mary Kastner: So we're gonna go ahead and refill it.

2593
03:56:29.850 --> 03:56:37.320
Mary Kastner: With with you, cutting it one and a half. But when you go pick it up Bill asked them if it's easy to collect

2594
03:56:42.900 --> 03:56:45.270
Mary Kastner: Well, the new ones will be different.

2595
03:56:46.470 --> 03:56:47.850
They'll be a little bigger.

2596
03:56:49.140 --> 03:56:50.280
Mary Kastner: Oh, yeah.

2597
03:56:54.960 --> 03:57:02.010
Mary Kastner: And you can ask him, tell him that you prefer to not have to cut them and he'll change.

2598
03:57:03.090 --> 03:57:04.320
Mary Kastner: The dosage for you.

2599
03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:14.970
Mary Kastner: And then the other meds are staying the same.

2600
03:57:16.590 --> 03:57:18.930
Bill: Yeah. Okay. Okay.

2601
03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:29.970
Bill: Take three what you have now until oh call in three days and let him know help the situation. I don't think we're gonna call her.

2602
03:57:29.970 --> 03:57:32.250
Mary Kastner: And you don't you don't even have to call now.

2603
03:57:32.280 --> 03:57:36.570
Mary Kastner: Because I realized I have to change the medicine. Anyway, yeah.

2604
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.870
Bill: Okay.

2605
03:57:40.980 --> 03:57:44.670
Bill: It doesn't do any good. In the morning is increasing.

2606
03:57:45.270 --> 03:57:47.730
Mary Kastner: Yeah, because, because it's gonna take a little

2607
03:57:47.730 --> 03:57:49.350
Mary Kastner: Time to tell actually

2608
03:57:55.980 --> 03:57:58.590
Bill: Well, no, I was gonna say that a few minutes ago to

2609
03:57:59.700 --> 03:58:00.120
Bill: Do the

2610
03:58:01.440 --> 03:58:03.150
Bill: Right away, or does it take

2611
03:58:03.210 --> 03:58:07.140
Mary Kastner: Oh I typically it takes about six weeks to tell

2612
03:58:07.920 --> 03:58:09.870
Bill: But I maybe I should just stay on the two

2613
03:58:10.500 --> 03:58:12.720
Bill: Yeah, about a week.

2614
03:58:14.040 --> 03:58:14.850
Mary Kastner: Yeah, another

2615
03:58:14.970 --> 03:58:15.990
Mary Kastner: Another week. Yeah.

2616
03:58:18.570 --> 03:58:19.170
What do you think

2617
03:58:20.580 --> 03:58:22.170
Bill: What do you think yeah I

2618
03:58:23.340 --> 03:58:24.270
Mary Kastner: Would like to see

2619
03:58:25.530 --> 03:58:26.130
Bill: Better morning

2620
03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:40.980
Mary Kastner: I would like to see you have quicker relief, so it's not going to hurt to go up to one and a half, I would like to see change it. Now, typically is the anti depressants, it takes six weeks. It should take less

2621
03:58:42.120 --> 03:58:43.380
Bill: And what do you mean by left

2622
03:58:44.400 --> 03:58:45.750
Mary Kastner: In less time for us know

2623
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:47.640
Bill: I know improvement. Yeah.

2624
03:58:49.380 --> 03:58:53.400
Bill: How much less because that's what he gets upset about. He said, your mornings aren't any better.

2625
03:58:53.580 --> 03:58:54.960
Mary Kastner: Well, yeah, yeah.

2626
03:58:55.200 --> 03:58:56.550
Mary Kastner: Back anything. Yeah.

2627
03:58:57.630 --> 03:59:09.840
Bill: It depends on the morning. Yeah, well, like today, it's my birthday. You know, I'm really nervous and anxious because I have gone to meet them for dinner. The family.

2628
03:59:11.490 --> 03:59:15.390
Bill: And I'm really keyed up about that, you know,

2629
03:59:16.800 --> 03:59:22.080
Bill: I just, I don't want them to. I mean, they all know that I'm having problems, but

2630
03:59:23.400 --> 03:59:34.530
Bill: I don't want you know i just i feel funny I and he keeps saying you shouldn't feel funny. Those are your kids and your grandkids and, you know, and did I tell you, I'm going to be a great grandma.

2631
03:59:35.790 --> 03:59:39.660
Mary Kastner: You did. And you know, when I would be celebrating it so much.

2632
03:59:39.780 --> 03:59:41.100
Bill: Well, we have to. Yeah.

2633
03:59:41.160 --> 03:59:43.050
Bill: Well, yeah, yeah.

2634
03:59:43.140 --> 04:00:00.000
Mary Kastner: I'm not even a grandmother yet so I'm I think it's fabulous. So feel this is what I'm saying to the to the pharmacist and he can make that decision for you. I'm saying one milligram at bedtime. One milligram world tablet to take one and a half at bedtime.

2635
04:00:01.980 --> 04:00:12.270
Mary Kastner: And then I'm saying, please feel at 0.5 milligrams three tabs at bedtime. If the one milligram is hard to cut at one and a half at that time.

2636
04:00:13.470 --> 04:00:20.730
Mary Kastner: OK. OK. So I'll let him make that decision for you. And that way, it takes all that discussion part out of the way for you.

2637
04:00:24.330 --> 04:00:32.250
Mary Kastner: So I called in that and you're okay and your lorazepam because I did that last time. How are you doing on the Lexapro, that should be

2638
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.940
Bill: Plenty.

2639
04:00:33.540 --> 04:00:34.350
Of money okay

2640
04:00:36.780 --> 04:00:37.770
Mary Kastner: Okey dokey.

2641
04:00:38.940 --> 04:00:40.710
Mary Kastner: Happy super birthday.

2642
04:00:41.280 --> 04:00:42.990
Bill: Okay, thank you.

2643
04:00:43.200 --> 04:00:46.140
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and and like I said, I'm thinking you're

2644
04:00:48.090 --> 04:00:53.250
Mary Kastner: On one of the diagnoses that we are looking at your symptoms of much improved.

2645
04:00:56.100 --> 04:01:02.160
Mary Kastner: And we're, we're almost there on the anxiety I want it below five

2646
04:01:03.540 --> 04:01:05.160
Mary Kastner: And we're almost there.

2647
04:01:06.240 --> 04:01:08.310
Bill: Here in the morning. It's not below five I think

2648
04:01:09.810 --> 04:01:11.430
Bill: We're getting better.

2649
04:01:12.810 --> 04:01:21.780
Mary Kastner: But we we really want you to start doing some non pill kind of therapy why by doing those exercises in the book. OK.

2650
04:01:23.160 --> 04:01:33.150
Mary Kastner: OK, OK. And now if you don't feel like you need to see me weekly, you can certainly come every other week. It's totally up to you.

2651
04:01:36.900 --> 04:01:40.440
Bill: I don't know. I mean other than changing the medication.

2652
04:01:41.460 --> 04:01:41.790
Mm hmm.

2653
04:01:42.840 --> 04:01:46.320
Mary Kastner: Um, why don't you come next week.

2654
04:01:47.940 --> 04:01:52.320
Mary Kastner: And we'll see if the change in the medicine did anything. And we'll make that decision.

2655
04:01:54.540 --> 04:01:55.290
Mary Kastner: At that time,

2656
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:58.800
Mary Kastner: To maybe come every other week.

2657
04:02:02.700 --> 04:02:03.960
Mary Kastner: Does that sound okay to you.

2658
04:02:06.480 --> 04:02:07.140
Mary Kastner: Okay.

2659
04:02:08.580 --> 04:02:08.760
You're

2660
04:02:10.470 --> 04:02:13.440
Mary Kastner: Okay, yeah, but come next week and we'll make that decision.

2661
04:02:14.700 --> 04:02:16.350
Mary Kastner: Okay, you have a great day.

2662
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:21.240
Bill: On that again. All right. Bye bye.
