Gwenevere Abriel: She's so cute. I'm gonna try that.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little brain action because I'm not going to be getting any highlights done. I'm going to be stuck in here.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.680
Jaime C: Right.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.820
Jaime C: Um,

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And truth shall be revealed.

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I always say, I'm gonna go get my low lights, put in and like y'all came on.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.200
Sure you're

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're going stir crazy or what

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.770
Jaime C: Well workout still keeping me busy so

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's interesting. I hear a lot of people say all this work in a hotel has been cancelled. So their jobs are coming to an end, or if you had to kind of lay people off or yours just carries on like normal what's going on.

16
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.290
Jaime C: I know I've had to while we're putting them on furlough

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.870
Jaime C: Hello. Yeah, and

18
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.730
Jaime C: So because I'm the only person here on this property that's on salary. I'm working most shifts myself.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Lucky you.

20
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.880
Right.

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now inside of the salaried employee.

22
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so what about the dynamics of hey, what about this promotion and which state, am I going to move to is everything on a screeching halt.

23
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.490
Jaime C: How you do it around us. Yeah, everything's definitely in a halt. They the company as a whole, isn't hiring isn't transferring anything like that and they

24
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.110
Jaime C: The hiring managers are actually a couple of them how reached out to me and they did tell me that

25
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.190
Jaime C: What I have working against me right now is the company decided to sell 125 more properties. So that's 125

26
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.360
Jaime C: GM that are looking for other positions.

27
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That sucks.

28
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.410
Jaime C: Yeah tude

29
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.490
Okay.

30
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.620
Huh.

31
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any sunny side to this.

32
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:49.410
Jaime C: Just, I mean, just that I have definitely put got my name out there with the regional managers and the hiring managers and they all you know or know me by name and have all spoke very highly of you so

33
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.700
Jaime C: I think that I don't think it's going to hurt me as much as it sounds, I guess.

34
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.220
Jaime C: But we will see, I'm sure I'm sure that the sale on the property that I'm at now is probably going to be postponed.

35
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How was your relationship with your son.

36
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.310
Jaime C: Or good he's had a rough couple weeks, but they're good.

37
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.220
Jaime C: And

38
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.390
Jaime C: We had to put the dog down his dog down

39
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.280
Jaime C: So we've been staying at the hotel because my house isn't ready till the first so

40
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.230
Jaime C: I was working a desk one day and his girlfriend came to the desk like oh worried and it panic and she said, Taylor need your help.

41
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.620
Jaime C: And I was like, what's going on. And she said, the dog is just freaking out. I was like, what the heck. So I went to the room.

42
00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:03.660
Jaime C: And I'm like standing in the doorway and the dogs in the cage that candle and he's just sitting there barking and kind of like being weird. I don't know what it is. I don't know. It was just weird.

43
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:14.220
Jaime C: And the other dog without and me and my son are facing each other, talking and the other dog had jumped up on the table to get us food. And I said, Hey, I was about ready to get your food.

44
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.870
Jaime C: And as soon as he turned around to go get her. The gate opened up.

45
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:28.740
Jaime C: On the at the where the dog was the gate opened up and the dog just came flying out freaking out and he went after my kid, kind of, he got them in the back of the

46
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.200
Jaime C: Calf here. So I just threw myself on top of that dog, and he latched onto my arm and just shook. He just would not let go.

47
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:48.870
Jaime C: And I just kept hitting him and hitting him and he wasn't letting go and he latched onto this arm that was hitting him. And so finally, my son was able to like throw him off of me and then we booked out of the room and left the dog in there.

48
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.750
Jaime C: It was just crazy. And so we had to call the ambulance. We had to call animal control. I mean, my, my arms were tore up pretty bad and

49
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.430
Jaime C: So Animal Control got them out of the room and and took them.

50
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.950
Jaime C: Really sad.

51
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.270
Yeah.

52
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:20.370
Jaime C: I'm just glad I didn't get my son like that and that I was there, I am very grateful for the way that it did turn out. It could have been a whole lot worse.

53
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:33.450
Jaime C: I mean, I was when I was fighting with him. I was on the ground on my side. And all I keep thinking about is, what if you would have latched onto my neck or you know even all bad. So I am grateful for the way that it did. No.

54
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.080
Jaime C: It's really um

55
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:49.410
Jaime C: I didn't realize how traumatizing. I guess it was for me until the last couple days. Every time I like think about it. I can feel my heart racing and just get anxious and

56
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the thoughts that are going with the heart racing. What is it making you think about

57
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:06.510
Jaime C: I just keep like replaying the situation and, you know, I just feel for the dog. I feel for my son. I just just sad. I hate it.

58
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you feel for your son, and you feel for your dog and in the replay. Are you in the replay. Are you in the imagery

59
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.070
Jaime C: Yeah, yeah, I just

60
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.960
Jaime C: Like when I do think about it. I keep I think about how much worse that could have been, like, what could have happened.

61
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.730
Okay.

62
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And how distressed from you right now zero to 100

63
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.370
Jaime C: About the situation or life in general.

64
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right now.

65
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.510
Jaime C: Um, I've actually been feeling pretty very anxious, the last few days.

66
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give it a number, so I can kind of get a range of that.

67
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.510
Jaime C: I would say like a eight so

68
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.200
At

69
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero to 100. Okay, so, yeah. So in general, at and when you just now are thinking about replaying that it the imagery feeling for sun feeling for dog and replaying what happened to you.

70
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing is that imagery

71
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.980
Jaime C: Be I am you know go up to about a 90 probably 95

72
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you want to do some some desensitizes around that.

73
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We could do a couple of different things. Because you had an actual what I call shock trauma. It's an isolated event.

74
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And

75
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you, let me rewind when you just now. And you said, you know, I've been feeling anxious. We're exactly where you feeling

76
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The anxiousness. This is very specific around the body. Did you

77
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.570
Jaime C: Did you notice like my heart races. I can feel it in my chest. My heart races and

78
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.610
Jaime C: I feel like I get

79
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.670
Jaime C: I can see

80
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.100
Okay.

81
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This this intervention that I'd like to do with you is difficult because I can't see your body

82
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically I can see people and I can pick up on really subtle movements that are going on, but I can't. I can't see yours. I can't tell foot knee hand arms. I can't see what's going on.

83
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.790
Jaime C: Well, when you went through that I am shaking my foot. Okay.

84
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.860
Jaime C: Which foot

85
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.850
Jaime C: My right foot.

86
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're naming this emotion as anxious and

87
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: He said,

88
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there been any any intrusion into nightmares and dreams.

89
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.490
Jaime C: No.

90
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.440
Jaime C: Okay.

91
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw you doing this.

92
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier.

93
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you turn the screen down just a little bit so I only see the top of your forehead, which doesn't change much throughout a session and down because or we don't do much up here in the top

94
00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The graph. Yeah, that's good. What, what, what was the emotion again when you were defending yourself with a dog.

95
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.480
Jaime C: Like when I think about it now.

96
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you just did it earlier you said, and he latched on

97
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200
Jaime C: Yeah, he just he latched on there and just

98
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: On the right arm.

99
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.450
Jaime C: Left, left arm.

100
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.240
So here

101
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're holding it now.

102
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.060
Jaime C: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

103
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you hold it when you just sort of have it there.

104
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Which to notice more how the arm feels or the hand how the hand feels

105
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.190
Jaime C: Really my arm.

106
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Arm how's it doing

107
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.870
Jaime C: It's much better.

108
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.140
Jaime C: Yeah, I mean the healings good and

109
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.120
Yeah.

110
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And it could have been worse.

111
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said that it also went to the

112
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Other he went from left and he then he

113
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.190
Jaime C: You early

114
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's how's this one.

115
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.080
Jaime C: How is it healing.

116
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how's it going

117
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.720
Jaime C: Yeah, much better.

118
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.880
Jaime C: They are much, much better.

119
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.390
Jaime C: They still leaks and stuff, but they're much better. Right. It's probably hard for you to see how

120
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like almost like a tattooing or

121
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: really subtle. I imagine it's not subtle. No.

122
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.170
Okay.

123
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that's a much worse. What is it that you picture could have happened.

124
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.430
Jaime C: That I wasn't there, and he got my kid.

125
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.720
Jaime C: And I wasn't wasn't going to be there to help him.

126
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.850
Jaime C: And what I think I just I think about that scenario.

127
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.570
Jaime C: And me laying on the ground and just him getting my neck. Instead of my other hand

128
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you

129
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Worry about me. What do you worry about

130
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.220
Jaime C: I'm sorry, what did you

131
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

132
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you do worry about the dog when you replay. I feel for my son, and for the dog. What do you play out with the dog.

133
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.520
Jaime C: I just feel bad that he had to be put down

134
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.400
Jaime C: I feel bad that

135
00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.210
Jaime C: I just feel bad for him. I feel bad that he was like that I feel bad that

136
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:06.600
Jaime C: I don't know that if he was scared or what was going on with him, but I just feel bad. I feel bad that

137
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.700
Jaime C: We had to put him down.

138
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To have a hypothesis about what he was scared of

139
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.630
Jaime C: I don't

140
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.820
Jaime C: I just know that

141
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:38.340
Jaime C: Last summer, when I was working out of town. He was hit by a car and it didn't like run him over, but it knocked him. Mm hmm. Always. And ever since then. He just has been a whole different dog. Yeah.

142
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've mentioned dog behavior. It's in my mind like

143
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: He was behaving in a particular way with your son. It's in my memory. I don't know what it was and it wasn't a positive, it was, it was a negative thing and I can't remember what the stories were, but I remember

144
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.560
Jaime C: Uh, he's he's snapped at my son before

145
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That might have been it

146
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.330
Yeah.

147
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.500
Jaime C: And we talked about getting rid of the dog before

148
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.100
Jaime C: But I just never

149
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.650
Jaime C: In a million years, never would have thought he would have attacked us like that.

150
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.600
Jaime C: never would have thought

151
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I am so so sorry.

152
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.350
Jaime C: Go ahead. I feel like there's just something

153
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.600
Jaime C: Wrong with the dog.

154
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And he was with another animal right

155
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.530
Jaime C: Yeah.

156
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And he was behaving differently or the same

157
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.060
Jaime C: The other animal

158
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

159
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.400
Jaime C: He was behaving the same

160
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Barking it's unfair thing.

161
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.070
Jaime C: No, I mean, all right. I'm sorry. No, she she wasn't barking at anything she was just calming normal

162
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.560
Jaime C: Freaking out in the cage.

163
00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.660
Jaime C: I don't know if they're not, they're used to running around outside all day every day. I don't know.

164
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.630
Jaime C: I mean, it's been a couple days that we were at the hotel. So I don't know, maybe he just, I don't know, I don't

165
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Being cooped up you're suspecting may somehow have and maybe this accident, maybe some brain injury.

166
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that makes sense.

167
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.550
Wow.

168
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.530
Jaime C: I just never would have thought I never would have thought he would hurt either one of us like that.

169
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:31.800
Jaime C: It's baffling to me.

170
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How much of the day do you spend going through these memories.

171
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.140
Jaime C: The last couple days. I feel like it's been a lot

172
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.400
Jaime C: I just, I feel stressed out about everything will be

173
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.980
Jaime C: Honest. Okay.

174
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is just one of several things.

175
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing.

176
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe before you had

177
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a routine of doing some things. And now you don't have that available to what what routine has changed.

178
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.670
Jaime C: I'm

179
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.660
Jaime C: Just

180
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.160
Jaime C: I mean it's it's hard, living in a hotel.

181
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.720
Jaime C: I don't get to come home and you know cook dinner for Taylor or

182
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.720
Jaime C: We don't get to, you know, take the dog for a walk or anything. We just

183
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.260
Jaime C: And I'm just slammed with work constantly especially being here on property. It's a lot easier for

184
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.280
Jaime C: Employees to reach out to me for silly things

185
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And how much of this is with with Taylor.

186
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And cooking. Is it the preparation time hanging out with them doing that. That's the unwinding part

187
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.990
Jaime C: Now, okay.

188
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So just checking to see if it was connection time with him, or if it was you unwinding.

189
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.840
Jaime C: Or is probably both little bit of both.

190
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So what, how are you hanging out with Taylor. How do you get to hang with him.

191
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.420
Jaime C: Um,

192
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.500
Jaime C: Lately, we just

193
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.600
Jaime C: We kind of don't

194
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:50.490
Jaime C: Know I'm just, I'm working a lot. And then he has a separate room that are you do. Um, and so, like, he'll come over to this room and hanging out with me. You know, we were watching Family Guy. We watched an episode of Family Guy. The other day together but

195
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.860
Jaime C: Yeah, he's definitely consumed with spending his time with his girlfriend lately.

196
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And where she's saying.

197
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.300
Jaime C: chillin at home, but she's here a lot

198
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about you and

199
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The breakout together break up together you together broken up, what's the status with your relationship.

200
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.820
Jaime C: Yeah, we're not together.

201
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And are you feeling some of that as well. Do you think

202
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.340
Yeah.

203
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, like who does Jamie get to talk to

204
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Who do you get to talk to

205
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.030
Jaime C: You

206
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you haven't seen me at all, long time.

207
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been

208
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot going on.

209
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.510
Jaime C: Yeah, it's definitely

210
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.520
Jaime C: Life changing

211
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.250
Jaime C: You have to learn just different behaviors and you have to learn how to live without certain things.

212
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.350
Like what do you need to live.

213
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.310
Jaime C: Well, I mean, it was nice feeling like I was loved by somebody

214
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.630
Jaime C: It was nice getting that attention every day.

215
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that daily text of how was your day, or I love you and just touching base, at least at least touching base.

216
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:25.980
Knowing right

217
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:40.770
Jaime C: Right. And I, you know, anytime there was something stressful going on or work or something. I can always just event to him and he was easy to talk to. And very smart and just felt better.

218
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.180
Jaime C: I felt good to run to him and vent to him and

219
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.960
Jaime C: So it feels different. Not having them.

220
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And your sister.

221
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Is she consumed and preoccupied with things that she's kind of an unavailable buddy at this point.

222
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.220
Jaime C: She just has she just has a lot going, yeah.

223
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:26.430
Jaime C: I mean, I kind of talked her. I do. It's just different with her. She's got a lot going on, you know, it's not like we have like quality conversations, I guess, cuz she has. She has two toddlers. She's very busy.

224
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:39.090
Jaime C: And you know, it's hard to get into deep conversations, I guess, or even to event because she's distracted while we're on the phone or yeah it's just not. It's just different.

225
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In the workplace, you are on property.

226
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anyone who you could risk.

227
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Developing a friendship with that wouldn't feel like

228
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: dual role where you mix too much with friendship with working can get really sideways pretty quickly. But, and you run seen anyone where you might be nice to are safe, even to talk and develop a friendship.

229
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:25.950
Jaime C: I mean, my boss Melissa and I, we have good conversations like I trust her that way. She was just very overbearing

230
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she's almost there. Um,

231
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been incidents with her where she hasn't kind of been on your side.

232
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes me wonder if she's someone giving you can't vent about work really me maybe talk about a couple of employees, but sometimes it's her behavior that you want to vent about

233
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.700
Jaime C: Yeah, and she just

234
00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:01.110
Jaime C: Like if you were so if i if she gives you advice and you don't go with her advice. I mean, you have to hear about it for weeks. It's annoying. Yeah.

235
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.830
Jaime C: Something's like go to her about in summer camp.

236
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're not getting

237
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Ongoing connection with a boyfriend. You're not getting ongoing connection really from sister, you're not getting it from your son.

238
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that might be part of this this anxiousness

239
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.180
No one.

240
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.060
Jaime C: Wakes up. Yeah.

241
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your ideas about how to make a change around that.

242
00:22:52.320 --> 00:23:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No one in the family. You want to reconnect to this might be a time right with the crisis going on we this is when we can either get closer, we can get further away tonight.

243
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:09.090
Jaime C: When my brother, my brother and I, you know, our relationship has been

244
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:18.420
Jaime C: non existent for years, but he finally did start reaching out to me, within the last couple weeks.

245
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:25.020
Jaime C: He asked me about Greg said me. I was really surprised.

246
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.790
Jaime C: He was asking me about Greg and kind of talking that out with me.

247
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:49.110
Jaime C: So I think it probably be I probably could take advantage of that of this time and reconnect with my brother. We were always really very close as kids and in our early 20s. And then once I kind of was in active addiction. He didn't want anything to do with that and

248
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.920
Jaime C: We just haven't had a relationship. Since I guess.

249
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.420
Why he called

250
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple weeks ago. Well, this is reason for calling.

251
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.860
Jaime C: To tell me that he, him and his wife are pregnant.

252
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's good news. How exciting.

253
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:20.970
Jaime C: And he's, he, he has two other kids well his oldest son is the same age as Taylor, but his daughter. He didn't call me and tell me about her, but I would, I was also an active addiction, at the time, but

254
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.150
Jaime C: It's definitely a huge change and my brother reach out to me for that. Yeah.

255
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he seem like someone who could listen without judging if you did want to just bent

256
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's, let's just see if it's really

257
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.640
A place you could do that.

258
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a pocket of content that you worry he might judge you around.

259
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.020
Jaime C: Just, I mean, just when it comes to addiction. I think he's just not understanding of that her

260
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.510
Jaime C: How everything else in life. I could probably I could go to him. I think

261
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And addiction, do you define it as

262
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I used a substance.

263
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To mask my feelings. I use a substance to mask. My grief. I used a substance to

264
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Get high not accept reality cope with things I did. I didn't want look at. That's something he can't accept

265
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:44.100
Jaime C: I think he Yeah he can he just because my brother knows

266
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.980
Jaime C: I mean, him and I were molested, same time at the same person. So we do have that

267
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:57.090
Jaime C: Connection there and him and I have talked about it in the past.

268
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.540
Jaime C: But the way he sees it is

269
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:07.380
Jaime C: If he was molested by the same person, same time and you didn't get into addiction. He never became an addict.

270
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.690
Jaime C: Then why did I have to

271
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.150
Jaime C: Like he just doesn't

272
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

273
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do

274
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: With that, we can dip into what he does with it. But how do you respond in a sense, not. I don't care what you really said to him, but like in here. What's your opinion about what he said.

275
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.560
Jaime C: That's ridiculous.

276
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:47.340
Jaime C: Yeah, that would be great if I could have lived life and not have to become an addict. That would have been great if I didn't have to have that pain, my whole life. I wish I could have stopped at like he did, but

277
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.170
Jaime C: I don't know what to tell him I don't know how to feel about that. I'm just a different person.

278
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

279
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's typically over in one sneeze, we should be good.

280
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So he stuffed it down.

281
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

282
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:18.540
Jaime C: He says that he doesn't remember it happening until him and I started talking about it when I was 38 years ago.

283
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So what he did was, it was repressed, which means it was completely out of the consciousness.

284
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And he was how old when the

285
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: perpetration was happening when he was, he

286
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.470
Jaime C: So I was

287
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.240
Jaime C: Four or five and six. So he and he's two years older than I am.

288
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.520
Jaime C: So 678

289
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.050
Jaime C: Rather

290
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the likelihood that he would remember it is so much higher than you, because he was old right

291
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.900
Jaime C: He says he remembers that clear as day now.

292
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.830
You know what the irony is

293
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: His brain somehow shut it off.

294
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've had to deal with it in your memory. HE HASN'T HAD TO IT WAS OUT

295
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You've had a harder time because it's been in your consciousness.

296
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It does make me wonder how it might have showed up on him before you're saying he's never had any physical illness and you know for sure there's no compulsive behaviors that you know us right but do we really know

297
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.630
Jaime C: I mean, there was a point in time where he was drinking a lot

298
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.620
Jaime C: And he works out like a madman.

299
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.020
Jaime C: So it could very well be those behaviors. I don't know how much he drinks now.

300
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what's a lot

301
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.320
Jaime C: Like every night he would have probably three or four drinks and he drinks whiskey.

302
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's works out like a madman. What is that

303
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.980
Jaime C: Like when he's at home and not doing anything that's why he is doing. He has a gym in his garage you works out.

304
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right. That's kind of what I want to know constantly tell me what what does that really mean like

305
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:51.450
Jaime C: I feel like, from what I've seen is anytime. He's easy, they're at home working out or he's at work like he's when he's at home. That's what he's doing. He's in his garage working out.

306
00:29:52.590 --> 00:30:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, so this is good luck comes home at 530 takes his clothes off puts the gym Stefan goes in there and he's in there for how long.

307
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.250
Jaime C: Hours.

308
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Two hours.

309
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.870
Jaime C: I'd say probably three or four hours at least

310
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he married

311
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes, three kids now.

312
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.710
Jaime C: It's got a third one on the way. Yeah.

313
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he has to be doing something else.

314
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just laying with you.

315
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's a fancy word for people that work.

316
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's called sublimation.

317
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We it's an actual thing and in our culture. You know, it's the most advanced the most right you know evolved of all of our, you know, defense mechanisms and, you know, no one notices it they they call a ma. Well, you're such a little workaholic, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.

318
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But nobody says

319
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're an at it.

320
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But I might

321
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I might say, hmm.

322
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how that's affecting your relationship. I wonder what you're doing to your body.

323
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's a lot. There's doesn't seem to be striking a balance in there. And typically we hear it through complaints from a spouse, saying, Hey, what about me or the kids are like, DAD, WHERE'S DAD, WHERE'S DAD, WHERE'S DAD COME play

324
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: With us hear it out here, but for him to tell you that there's a problem is unlikely you'd ever hear it.

325
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.490
Yeah.

326
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But that doesn't mean that alcohol work a holic workaholic right makes sense if you've heard that term.

327
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And going and exercising excessively, those are ways to cope

328
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We can overdo anything.

329
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how, like, you know, nobody is going to give him a medication because he's working too much going to the gym too much or they might make a fuss about the alcohols, maybe something happened that caught his attention he reach handled it somewhere else.

330
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that already, you know it, but he doesn't. He's remained sort of

331
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Judgmental about it. You know what it does make me wonder though.

332
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like I should do my whole session today upside down.

333
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this today.

334
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm there 50% of the time I'm. It makes me think, well, if I busy and I'm blaming you.

335
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Then the whole topic doesn't have to come up and I don't have to think about it.

336
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If I had if I talked to my sister about her addiction. If I didn't just just clean sweep just summarily say she's just week or whatever his summary is, I don't know.

337
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And he doesn't have to look at his own vulnerability. He doesn't have to think about the memory.

338
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is, I think, additional way to look at what he's doing versus

339
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your the problem.

340
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.970
Jaime C: Yeah, I can see them.

341
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:40.650
Jaime C: I know the only thing that he's ever said about it. Was he said that he feel the way it has changed him, he said was that he doesn't like

342
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.360
Jaime C: being touched. I guess like he my uncles and stuff will give him a hug, and he doesn't like it. He said,

343
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.600
Jaime C: But I guess that was kind of off.

344
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's all mine.

345
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

346
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: On subject.

347
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Number. I said, it's going to show up through the relationships. Yeah, you're telling me he doesn't want to be touched by uncle's imagine my wife. Imagine by children.

348
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: He would be would not be so sure that there are not effects because, look who's telling the story I'd be more interested in what wife is has to say.

349
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:32.160
Jaime C: Right. And she's very timid and soft spoken and very sweet. So I don't shoe and even

350
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 not gonna say anything. Yeah.

351
00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And so he hasn't completely isolated. He can he can be right rigid got a soft spoken spouse know then you never going to confront

352
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.550
Jaime C: Yeah, and he's been very mean he's very

353
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:58.950
Jaime C: Like my whole our whole lives. He was super awkward when you'd give him a hug or something. He's very awkward very

354
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:14.970
Jaime C: Like anything. It was kind of he would laugh it off or joke behind you know like serious situations that kind of stuff. But I feel like as he's getting older, he's becoming a hell of a lot softer.

355
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If you had to guess, would you say

356
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That if you were on the phone with your brother.

357
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That the reason you don't kind of chat about the struggle with addiction.

358
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Or chemical dependency know this word play but

359
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because

360
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your embarrassment.

361
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Or because

362
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're protecting him in some way.

363
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:14.310
Jaime C: Probably. I mean, I can see both situations you know I've always been

364
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:24.840
Jaime C: The black sheep of the family. And it's always been very easy for them to blame everything on me because I'm the addict, um,

365
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:32.400
Jaime C: But now that I'm 1200 miles away from my family and I've been clean for years.

366
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:45.750
Jaime C: They still have the same issues they still have the same problems, they still my other two sisters are always fighting like crazy. My mom's always cold and it's still the same issues so

367
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.150
Jaime C: I don't, I guess I don't

368
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.760
Jaime C: I don't know. We haven't really talked enough to know that.

369
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.530
Jaime C: At this point,

370
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the worst.

371
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.570
Jaime C: The worst thing.

372
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.440
Yeah.

373
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:20.790
Jaime C: Far away just I will believe that he doesn't want a relationship ever again and doesn't have faith, it'll stay clean

374
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Has he ever come

375
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.570
Jaime C: Yo yos like Al

376
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.590
Tell me.

377
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:47.460
Jaime C: Like when when I was in active addiction. He refused to talk to me refused it. Even when

378
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.240
Jaime C: Even when I was in the hospital. My daughter died. He's wouldn't talk to me.

379
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's a big one.

380
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you guys process that

381
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So he can hear himself explain his fear.

382
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.500
No.

383
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:29.610
Jaime C: Nothing's ever been talked about ever he's, you know, we've gotten to arguments and then he will shut somebody when he's mad at somebody who will shut you out and he will not talk to you for years.

384
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.130
Jaime C: And then all the sudden

385
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:39.180
Jaime C: I mean, slowly, he'll start coming back into your life and nothing just nothing's ever talked about, it's just

386
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:51.090
Jaime C: I feel like he's going to regret that there's been a lot of years where him and I haven't been in each other's lives because he's just stubborn.

387
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.150
Jaime C: That's crazy. You can't go back. You can't get that time back

388
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If it meant that again.

389
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:07.500
Jaime C: The

390
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Burden was on you to be strong again.

391
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is

392
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we think

393
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The man.

394
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Shuts people out is the strong one. But

395
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the one that's wrong because you're going to sit with the feelings.

396
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.970
Jaime C: Yeah, I can 100% see that now.

397
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: If it meant that you

398
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Decided to do it again to be the strong one.

399
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To lead the way to show him.

400
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your okay

401
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you can actually live with profound grief.

402
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't work you out.

403
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out that

404
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This sort of legacy for you is I can now talk about daughter father

405
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This this this history, and I don't fall apart. It doesn't define who I am.

406
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if that might change what he feels like he can live with what he might start to experiment sitting with some uncomfortable feelings.

407
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And you guys might have more connection you guys might have a close friendship.

408
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If, however, gets

409
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're so angry about him not being a friend during that time period.

410
00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unlikely that that would happen.

411
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:06.330
Jaime C: I don't think I'm angry at him. It's just hurtful. Hmm. I love my brother, more than anything, and I just want us to have a good relationship.

412
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.320
Jaime C: It's just there's still things in the past, but just heard.

413
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and Mike My guess is that hurt.

414
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: He probably senses. It doesn't want to own it doesn't want to talk about it doesn't want to hear from you.

415
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're hurt because maybe he couldn't pull it together. He couldn't be there for you as a brother.

416
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When he could have been

417
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: His ways to work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work.

418
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of You, you, you have a fair shot at a similar coping skill to you kind of dive into work.

419
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: keep yourself busy with down

420
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.870
Yeah.

421
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if he cuts himself off and ways also with intimacy and friendships wonder sometimes he feels that same kind of isolation and maybe loneliness even

422
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In hiding who he is like the full scope.

423
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.370
Jaime C: Yeah.

424
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.050
Jaime C: I could see that.

425
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm opening up your note again.

426
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at the goals that you've set

427
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to continue to work through the impact of childhood molestation and we've had some distance associated with work insurance scheduling.

428
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's let's do a little update on this goal, though.

429
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear from you how you assess how

430
00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working through how that's going

431
00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.850
Jaime C: Well, I feel

432
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.170
Jaime C: Like I can think about it now and it doesn't

433
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:45.540
Jaime C: Like I don't notice any physical reaction when I'm thinking about it. Now that you know the day that we

434
00:43:46.950 --> 00:44:03.780
Jaime C: I mean, I don't even know what we would call it, but where we were in that room. Yeah, my dad there. And I mean, and we had pictured him just acknowledging that I feel like since then. Things have just been completely different when it comes to that. It just feels lighter

435
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:14.010
Jaime C: It's and I keep thinking about how it just seems so crazy to me that

436
00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.790
Jaime C: I just needed my parents to acknowledge that

437
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it. So let me, let me tell you some psychology about why it probably feels so profound

438
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: People can be physically hit. We can be emotionally exploited. We can be sexually abused you can really damage the physical body.

439
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is next level emotionally traumatizing

440
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When me

441
00:44:54.510 --> 00:45:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: As I'm developing, especially the earlier that this happens. So if I'm really young to have an invalidating environment.

442
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And what that looks like is

443
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't exist.

444
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That psychological impact of not being seen known

445
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is profoundly negatively impactful forever like this attachment, the importance of attachment. That's what it gets to

446
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is critical to interpersonal relationships, how we relate to ourselves self esteem confidence and going out into the world.

447
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am monumentally amazed at your accomplishments. When I think about

448
00:45:50.910 --> 00:46:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only was this invalidation chronic throughout life. And I'm wondering if because your dad had this ability to see you, love you and really see you that balanced it in the absence of that if it had just been an invalidating mother and on top of that this this violation. History

449
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what

450
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The job you do i just i i am i'm grateful that your dad.

451
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There.

452
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.730
Jaime C: Need to

453
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't surprise me in the anchor room that that you created that you know that that that happened.

454
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he's been your anchor. He's what's I probably been what's kept you from going cuckoo bird. Yeah.

455
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.120
Absolutely, yeah.

456
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

457
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Concert

458
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Ritual relationships.

459
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Why do I need

460
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: To be acknowledged for something right now. Why is this so strong for me right now is the subject matter really that critical. No, it's the fact of the matter that this person understand me. Believe me, and acknowledge

461
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be something. The next time you sort of and it could be going on with Brother could be going on the sun because you don't have like a whole bunch of contact with different folks right now.

462
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Could happen with a boss, like I really need you to hear me. You know, I can show up there in a really big way. Because of that, that history.

463
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But I should get it, you know.

464
00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I you know the the why. Why would this

465
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So impactful. Why would carry my dad say these things feel so good and it didn't undo the the abuse. It's still there. There it is.

466
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But now you believed. Now, someone can see you in your hurt. They don't run away from it.

467
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't dismiss it.

468
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: They can hold the truth. And then we can let go of the impact we can let go, that there's some big horrible that I'm broke and then there's something wrong with me. No, it's in your imagination right in that imagery does like right there.

469
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't go anywhere.

470
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:39.690
Jaime C: Yeah.

471
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.260
Jaime C: felt really good.

472
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you get to feel lighter

473
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.330
Jaime C: Yes. Yeah, it's amazing how much lighter. I feel

474
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like me to do with

475
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This particular goal. I can leave it right where it is.

476
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be just something I've done it every month I touched lightly on it and you can tell me, is it showing up.

477
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not. And we can leave it there and then I'll just keep checking in on it every month.

478
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.260
Jaime C: Yeah, definitely do.

479
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll see see what's needed along the way.

480
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then

481
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.900
Didn't work, try to

482
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:26.460
Go.

483
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How about this one, continue to work through grief process.

484
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing around that.

485
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.200
Jaime C: Good grief with my dad or my daughter, or both.

486
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you wrote, you said the goal. So I didn't force a name in right. This was you

487
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now some of your notes you talked about. Let's see.

488
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got in August last year so ahead has been difficult with my dad.

489
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: His heart was racing very fast and put in one Hartman's he didn't like how it made them feel and he had a stroke. I was there with him was making fun of him as if

490
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You were hung over, he's

491
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: A bit I know I write notes. We're going to do just to take him to the ER his PT for had physical therapy for a week.

492
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I moved into pregnant was an abusive relationship age 21 nine months pregnant, the time felt shocking to see Dad breakdown is six five feet tall. Huge man.

493
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I showed him my ultrasound of the baby.

494
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to. I had been smacked around right before he died, and I did not go see him.

495
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad was all about family close family all that was over with him. My mom was destroyed, went to treatment in 2013 worked on the grief. I was there for six months then felt better and didn't have that sinking ache in my chest.

496
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And then in October. I wrote a little note.

497
00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Client reports a weight has been lifted it helped talking about dad, the pain.

498
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in the chest.

499
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In January, you mentioned denied having intruding thoughts, aside from the holidays. So those are the only things that got around that. So whether it's about daughter. Father, I don't know, because you didn't narrow it we can if you want me to. I can change whatever you want.

500
00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But so what what came up for you.

501
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.850
Jaime C: Um,

502
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:06.030
Jaime C: Well, I didn't notice that I when you started talking about being an abusive relationship.

503
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:12.570
Jaime C: And going and seeing my dad. Definitely. I had an emotional reaction to it for sure.

504
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's still now caring about it, right. So what was the thought of that went with that I'm going to do relationship. I didn't see my Dad, what's the, what's the thought just now.

505
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:39.450
Jaime C: I just feel guilty or I feel terrible. I feel bad because my dad hated my son's god he did not want me with him. And all I did was lied to my dad about how he wasn't hitting me and

506
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:50.010
Jaime C: And then I could, I didn't go see him on his last day on this earth because I didn't want him to see my face.

507
00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think we'll keep this goal. Sounds like we need some more time to kind of process that

508
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

509
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How many milligrams. I'll make a little note down here of swag Sunday on
