8
00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:04.260
Randy McWilliams: Found something. I know. Well, you know, we found this place about a month ago and we really liked it but we just weren't sure about jumping into something. It was like one of the first places that we looked at.

9
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.000
Randy McWilliams: And we also weren't sure with our, you know, financial status if we'd qualify

10
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.440
Randy McWilliams: But the guy got back to us the property manager and they were interested in leasing to us so

11
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.610
Randy McWilliams: We said, what the heck we at least tried the application. See where we stand and relaxing. So we moved in. So it's very exciting.

Randy McWilliams: Old friends near work so

18
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.790
Randy McWilliams: And the price was right.

19
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.730
Randy McWilliams: In this area, finding an affordable place that we could essentially split, we know

20
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.020

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.260
Randy McWilliams: I've taken a different approach.

Randy McWilliams: Surely has you know i i think

47
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.200
Randy McWilliams: Well, I know that. Do you know doing this through bright heart has been a monumental help for me.

48
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.150
Randy McWilliams: You know that's one facet of my life, where

49
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:34.530
Randy McWilliams: You know, I always had a hard time letting go of that even if I could like quitting drinking for a while, I would have a hard time letting go of other things which always lead to disruptive.

50
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:57.150
Randy McWilliams: More and more and more. So this starting with this. And then, you know, I was doing a religiously, up until the cobra thing up. And so that's kind of thrown me off track with the zoom, actually, you know, my girlfriend does zoom meetings.

51
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.790
Randy McWilliams: Pretty very regularly and last night.

52
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.810
Randy McWilliams: We tuned into a

53
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:21.300
Randy McWilliams: Young People's meeting there was 500 people on zoom for this meeting. And it was really, really something to see people from all over the country.

54
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.120
Randy McWilliams: All over the world. I saw some New Zealand's and there

55
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.140

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.690
Shawn Phalen: And I'm glad that you're doing the meeting.

57
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.380

58
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.960
In person I know it is. But it's what you got.

59
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.780
What you got, and working with God. So

63
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:19.500
Randy McWilliams: Mainly through phone have done a couple of Zoom's but yeah I miss that I definitely miss that.

64
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.830
Randy McWilliams: You know, in person.

65
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.140
Randy McWilliams: Experience, you know, there's definitely something to that in this

66
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:43.110
Randy McWilliams: When it comes to you know recovery and meetings based around recovery, but you know it's it's a perfectly

67
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.830
Randy McWilliams: Adequate band aid.

68
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.900
Randy McWilliams: For not having that

69
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.720
Randy McWilliams: Doing the zoom meeting staying in touch.

70
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.190
Randy McWilliams: And so yeah, I look forward to being able to get back to that.

71
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.430
Randy McWilliams: But you know, it's been working

72
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.370
Randy McWilliams: It's been working just fine.

73
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.410
Shawn Phalen: What's the situation with with here. We're like, are you still are you

74
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:24.000
Randy McWilliams: Crazy. Yeah. So we're considered essential employees down there. We're under the Contra Costa County Health Services banner.

75
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.490
Randy McWilliams: So first and foremost, our homeless program is a

76
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:42.060
Randy McWilliams: Is a clinic essentially for physical well being and mental health. Right. Can we work

77
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:55.710
Randy McWilliams: You know, in that under that title. So what we do is just sort of maintain shelter for these folks who come in out of the cold and get connected with

78
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:05.970
Randy McWilliams: You know, county health care and and mental health care. So I don't know. I think I shared with you that we had moved everyone into a hotel.

79
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:20.970
Randy McWilliams: Yeah. Um, so we have taken we have essentially 225 people from three different shelters in one hotel here right in town close to where I'm living so

80
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:30.780
Randy McWilliams: It's been crazy. It's been manageable. You know, just as manageable. The hotel.

81
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:53.310
Randy McWilliams: As it was under one roof at the shelter, but it's a lot more work for staff. There's no case management said essentially are very little because you know all of the agencies welfare Social Security etc are just doing things over the phone or on line.

82
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:05.160
Randy McWilliams: So there's no going with folks to those offices. So it's really just frontline work or serving meals to 225 people in the mail truck comes and

83
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:16.440
Randy McWilliams: We're trying to maintain the shelter in place. Yeah, the mask on at all times. But people come and go, you know that cats out of the bag.

84
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.560
Randy McWilliams: So it's not like we could every more than to a hotel room and no one's come out of the hotel room, you know, so

85
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.020
Randy McWilliams: Kind of crazy.

86
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.830
Shawn Phalen: City paying the hotel.

87
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:41.010
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, yeah, exactly, you know the the funding that came through the grant funding that came through.

88
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.200
Randy McWilliams: Ultimately from

89
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.870
Randy McWilliams: Shelters and local government.

90
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:57.480
Randy McWilliams: Went from funding the shelter to pay for this hotel. So there was some emergency

91
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.230
Randy McWilliams: Federal money going out to all cities essentially bring

92
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:13.230
Randy McWilliams: A homeless populations and on the street. During this Kobe to shelter place to stop the spread

93
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.600
Shawn Phalen: So you guys are still pretty much shelter new place non essential businesses or social turn in place, right.

94
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:49.890
Randy McWilliams: That's right. Yeah, I'm going to work my girlfriend works. She does work for a licensed conservator geriatric care. So she's going in a few days a week and does other work.

95
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.100
Randy McWilliams: considered essential, as do I.

96
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.470
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, but everyone else's essentially sheltered in place.

97
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.850
Shawn Phalen: And are you feeling like you're feeling like

98
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.610
Randy McWilliams: You've got a massive

99
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.930
Randy McWilliams: It's a great question. And the short answer is yes.

100
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.790
Randy McWilliams: There's still a lot of dangers, there's still a lot of interaction.

101
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:25.200
Randy McWilliams: There's it's far less dangerous than working in under one roof.

102
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.990
Randy McWilliams: As I did with

103
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.680
Randy McWilliams: Over 100 people homeless clients plus staff.

104
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:48.300
Randy McWilliams: You know all working in close proximity. So in that way, you know, wearing protective gear masks and continuing to wash after any interaction.

105
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.670
Randy McWilliams: It is a, it's a little safer. I feel a little safer, but

106
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:05.850
Randy McWilliams: And then not and then working there and going home to 1616 other people in the silver thing is what I was doing and

107
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.070
Randy McWilliams: You know my girlfriend shared that as well. Also,

108
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.530
Randy McWilliams: moving in together.

109
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.470
Randy McWilliams: You know, we're essentially shelter in place so she actually got tested.

110
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.610
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, last we thank God was

111
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.900
Randy McWilliams: Just before we move into

112
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:35.460
Randy McWilliams: That I haven't been tested yet. You know, I, I probably could. I certainly work.

113
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.630
Randy McWilliams: In an environment that would no doubt say yes, but

114
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:53.010
Randy McWilliams: You know, I haven't shown any symptoms and I haven't had direct contact with anyone who's known to have code. So thanks to do it. Yeah, not necessary, is what they told me

115
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.360
Randy McWilliams: Yeah.

116
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.100
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

117
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.020
Shawn Phalen: The grass. Yeah, um,

118
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:12.870
Shawn Phalen: How are you doing, though, like with everything else. I mean, I'm sure you're happy you're working and you know you're able to get out and about.

119
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:27.060
Randy McWilliams: Four days on and on some hands. Right. Well, it's interesting. It's interesting when moving in here over the weekend.

120
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:33.210
Randy McWilliams: You know, I have this moment was like you know we're in our own place now.

121
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:45.840
Randy McWilliams: I'm not accountable to a house full of other people under the sober living environment, you know, that's that crossed my mind yet.

122
00:13:48.540 --> 00:14:02.640
Randy McWilliams: But I have mean I've just been so busy obviously moving in and my taken a couple days off work to move in. But I still have school I have class tonight through zoom

123
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.730
Randy McWilliams: And

124
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:14.850
Randy McWilliams: You know, although my girlfriend and I support each other. Yeah, I mean that totally crossed my mind that intrusive thinking of a man

125
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:24.480
Randy McWilliams: Living on your own. Now you could easily go get a beer or whatever. It's like, I've just played that tape over and over

126
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:36.390
Randy McWilliams: You know, it's not like it had obsessive thoughts all weekend about it, but across my mind and what came first thing that came to mind was, I know exactly how I feel.

127
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:46.290
Randy McWilliams: You know, if I went out and had some drinks and then stopped taking the Suboxone and see what else is out there.

128
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.320
Randy McWilliams: It's a nightmare. I KNOW WHAT'S WAITING. If I do that.

129
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.180
Shawn Phalen: You know i think that i think that

130
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.770
Shawn Phalen: Even that's kind of a normal

131
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.880
Shawn Phalen: Normal feeling a normal thought in a way because you change your changing your

132
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.180
Randy McWilliams: In your environment. Right. Yeah.

133
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.320
Shawn Phalen: From what you've been doing for

134
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.190
Randy McWilliams: Right here now, right. That's right. Okay.

135
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:27.180
Shawn Phalen: So you're taking you're you're moving into a completely different environment, one that you want to be in. Right.

136
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.100
Randy McWilliams: Right, one that you've earned

137
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.970
Randy McWilliams: One that you've worked really hard for right

138
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:41.910
Shawn Phalen: So I think that you know that that's the alcoholic addict mind.

139
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.840
Randy McWilliams: Totally

140
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.400
Shawn Phalen: That you go that just you know popped into your head.

141
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.890
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, you know, and

142
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:58.650
Randy McWilliams: As long as it wasn't telling you to go to the bar which is not open, but there's shackling water, you know, like

143
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:06.390
Shawn Phalen: You know, always as long as that voice is not saying, Oh, I can just take I could just have you on

144
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.500
Right.

145
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.470
Shawn Phalen: Now you're going to stay on top of that, you're gonna you're gonna wrap yourself out.

146
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.740
Randy McWilliams: You can tell your girlfriend. You can tell you

147
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.790
Shawn Phalen: You know, you tell somebody about it because then when you call somebody about it. It takes the power out of it.

148
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.280
Randy McWilliams: Yeah you're right about that. You're absolutely right about that.

149
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.630
Randy McWilliams: It's interesting because I didn't share

150
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.140
Randy McWilliams: With her that that crossed my mind.

151
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.690
Randy McWilliams: And I, and I'm going to, I should

152
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.920
Shawn Phalen: I mean, if you don't tell her you tell your sponsor.

153
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.350
Randy McWilliams: You know, yeah, I'm like, if it's gonna

154
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.950
Randy McWilliams: She's gonna get really freaked out. She's out if she's gonna be like

155
00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.410
Shawn Phalen: You know, then, you know, think about who you want to share this with even though

156
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:13.290
Randy McWilliams: You just what counts as you're sharing it, and you're talking about aim, you're telling another person right it doesn't necessarily have to be your girlfriend.

157
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.600
Shawn Phalen: I mean, you already told me, but yeah I

158
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:34.380
Shawn Phalen: Think it's a good idea to tell your sponsor and if you have more of this thoughts, you know, you can call me text me whatever you know you're just staying on top. This is no this is new. So now this is the next step. This is the next stage in your

159
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.650
Shawn Phalen: In your sobriety.

160
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.310
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, this, this is what this is.

161
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.130
What you've earned

162
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.760
You know you are in there.

163
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:58.290
Shawn Phalen: So it's, it's about, you know, you know, to need to do you know you do your zoom meetings you talk to your sponsor.

164
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:06.780
Randy McWilliams: Go to work at useful. You keep things very simple soccer like Hayden.

165
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.910
Randy McWilliams: That's when it gets dangerous.

166
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.760
Shawn Phalen: You know, it just doesn't have to be like this. So,

167
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.660
Randy McWilliams: You're in a row right you're you're an adult and you're acting like an adult and you're you're living

168
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.390
Randy McWilliams: Like your age.

169
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.930
Shawn Phalen: Thing here your, you know, your adult date and

170
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.730
Randy McWilliams: Right. Right. Yes.

171
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.450
This is what this is life.

172
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:48.840
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, it's almost it's only taken me to get near the age of 50 to finally try to level out and feel like I'm finally adult thing.

173
00:18:50.580 --> 00:19:00.570
Randy McWilliams: Because I tell you the past God 10 years as just an absolute spiraling roller coaster of

174
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.960
Randy McWilliams: Misery and relapse after relapse and

175
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.280
Randy McWilliams: Just God but and I never

176
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.490
Randy McWilliams: I don't think about it too much. I think probably that keep it simple and just

177
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.380
Randy McWilliams: Mentality and just keep going. I'm here now.

178
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:35.430
Randy McWilliams: In this moment, everything starts right this sucker. The next step, the next choice is what's going to lead to

179
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.260
Randy McWilliams: What happens yellow consequences.

180
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.060
Yeah.

181
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.520
Shawn Phalen: Alright, so

182
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.060
Randy McWilliams: Yeah, graduations, like, that's amazing. If it's a big step. Yeah.

183
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.000
Randy McWilliams: It's up to us. I know.

184
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.740
Shawn Phalen: Like are you are you having stress or anxiety or you just

185
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:17.970
Randy McWilliams: Know, you know, I think there was some some thinking, you know, I mean we've both been in supportive environments. And I think that's probably crossed her mind like he she does. But he, I think the timing has been perfect. I think the timing is right.

186
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:28.230
Randy McWilliams: And we're both in a place where we're ready to move forward and and to enjoy life together.

188
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.370
Randy McWilliams: It's a big thing. It's a big life changing move for us.

206
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:27.330
Minh Triet Vu: I did not. I did not know forget, but somehow I while I was waiting for you. I thought

207
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.600
Minh Triet Vu: Maybe I had enough time for shower.

208
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.880
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, and I did.

209
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.740
Minh Triet Vu: So I did have a shower and then it was so relaxing.

210
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:55.200
Minh Triet Vu: And then, oh, I lost. Yeah, I lost track of time and when, when I finished it's already pass the time for the appointment and I apologize. Okay.

211
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.650
Shawn Phalen: Tommy

212
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.020
Minh Triet Vu: I'm sorry what was that

213
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.480
Shawn Phalen: Tell me, tell me how you been

214
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:13.170
Minh Triet Vu: Oh, I have been pretty calm, I think. Okay.

215
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.990
Shawn Phalen: And tell me why you think

216
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.730
Minh Triet Vu: I don't know.

217
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.310
Minh Triet Vu: Maybe because

218
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:29.040
Minh Triet Vu: I actually encounter a crisis. Okay. Well, I have been pretty calm. It's not about me, it's about my family.

219
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:45.780
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah. So my parents. You know, I live alone right but it's not. It's, it's not the case for my. It's not a case for for my parents, though, and they day. Wait.

220
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.020
Minh Triet Vu: can hang on one second. Sure.

221
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.310
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah. Sorry, I'm actually

222
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.640
Minh Triet Vu: At a place that my parents are staying in right now. I'm helping them moving

223
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.560
Minh Triet Vu: Stuff.

224
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.730
Minh Triet Vu: They used to. They used to live with.

225
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.790
Minh Triet Vu: A relative of ours. But right now, things change.

226
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.760
Minh Triet Vu: And they had to move and that's why I'm here helping them with the moving

227
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:31.380
Minh Triet Vu: And

228
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.130
Minh Triet Vu: They have been received a lot of stress, but

229
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:44.310
Minh Triet Vu: I'm pretty calm about this. Maybe one part of it because I'm not living here and living somewhere else.

230
00:24:45.270 --> 00:25:08.880
Minh Triet Vu: But I do feel I do feel the stress that they are receiving and somehow, somehow I feel like an effective because everything has been very logical. Yeah, though. Yeah, you know, the pandemic ever. Everyone is scared so as they stop please stop wanting to share house with

231
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.770
Minh Triet Vu: People who are not who are not directly toes.

232
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.500
Minh Triet Vu: So that's why I think that's why my parents had to move out.

233
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.210
Minh Triet Vu: And

234
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.660
Where are they moving

235
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.290
Minh Triet Vu: To another house.

236
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.220
You know,

237
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.250
Minh Triet Vu: Oh yes, they don't have enough, they don't have enough income to

238
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:48.030
Minh Triet Vu: To actually rent a house in this area in San Jose, they're living in San Jose. So they had to sort of stay with

239
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.030
Minh Triet Vu: All right, relatives always because they don't have enough income.

240
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:55.530
Okay.

241
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.140
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

242
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:04.710
Shawn Phalen: So the relative that they're living with were they afraid of getting sick. Is that what happened.

243
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:12.000
Minh Triet Vu: Yes. And the reaction that I think the reaction were quite severe.

244
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:26.520
Minh Triet Vu: I mean it's it's okay to be scared. Everyone is scared, I think. Everyone is scared, but it's not okay to be so scared that asked to act out violently, and

245
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.380
Minh Triet Vu: In certain

246
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.540
Minh Triet Vu: Circumstances, and I think it's better for everyone.

247
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:54.990
Minh Triet Vu: It's better for everyone's that things are now as they are. Okay, well I do worry, I am I am very worried, but somehow I I feel very calm about all this because it's been very logical and it's not as if

248
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.440
Minh Triet Vu: Things happen for no reason at all.

249
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.140
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, okay.

250
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.210
Shawn Phalen: So are you say you're very scared. What do you very scared about

251
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:24.690
Minh Triet Vu: I'm not scared about the pandemic, particularly, and I'm not scared about dying or getting infected, but I'm scared about how people reactions may somehow get out of control.

252
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:33.240
Minh Triet Vu: For once I yeah for once. I see what happens with my parents and I thought to myself, oh gosh

253
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.400
Minh Triet Vu: People can really react in such a way. Yeah. And that surprised me.

254
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:55.410
Minh Triet Vu: And also, I also a friend of a friend of mine share a video people people walk down the street and protests because they refuse to be

255
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.340
Minh Triet Vu: And they refuse to stay quarantine.

256
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:00.960
Minh Triet Vu: And

257
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:15.510
Minh Triet Vu: That's also that's also a surprise to me because they somehow ignore the FDA over off the community to prioritize their own

258
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.750
Minh Triet Vu: Freedom.

259
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.510
Minh Triet Vu: Right. So that's what I'm scared I'm scared of how

260
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:33.780
Minh Triet Vu: You know, people how people react in when a crisis actually hit them.

261
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:42.540
Minh Triet Vu: And in the midst of the panic. Our people around me. I feel pretty calm, for some reason.

262
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:52.200
Shawn Phalen: You feel you are relatively safe, even though we have this pandemic going around and

263
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.790
Shawn Phalen: Yes, yeah.

264
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:06.090
Minh Triet Vu: The safe one factor is that I stay home almost all the time because I like it. I like to stay home all the time. Exactly. And so

265
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.430
Shawn Phalen: Your anxiety has not been as

266
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:21.030
Minh Triet Vu: No other people's right. Actually, there has been zero thing answers feeling since we last talked

267
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:41.190
Minh Triet Vu: And not not even not even depression. I don't even sing anything about the sad things because somehow, somehow I watch all the madness happening around and I feel. Oh, okay. I guess I don't have time to think about my own feelings.

268
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.130
Minh Triet Vu: Because, yeah.

269
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:49.260
Shawn Phalen: So it's kind of like you're an outsider looking in with some of this stuff.

270
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.400
Minh Triet Vu: Yes. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

271
00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:01.800
Shawn Phalen: And so what's what I'm hearing is that you're looking at this as a very in a logical way.

272
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.240
Minh Triet Vu: I think so, yeah.

273
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.460
And I think that's also

274
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.340
I think that's very smart to do. And I think that's also what keeps you feeling safe.

275
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.820
Is because your logical about this.

276
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:27.120
And if you're if you're avoiding social situations you doing social distancing and washing our hands or staying home.

277
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.010
Then your chances of catching the virus are very small.

278
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.920
Minh Triet Vu: So you're doing what is the logical thing to do.

279
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.490
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

280
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.950
Minh Triet Vu: Are you still taking medication. Yes, I do.

281
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.300
Do you feel the medications, helping

282
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.260
Minh Triet Vu: I actually don't know anymore.

283
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:08.760
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, I mean, so taking it because it's not it's not safe to start right. I think so.

284
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.740
Minh Triet Vu: I agree.

285
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:23.040
Minh Triet Vu: Okay, that's one thing. And then the other thing is I do feel, I do want to to go back to school, so

286
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.210
Minh Triet Vu: I know continue medication will help me.

287
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.610
Minh Triet Vu: Getting there.

288
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:40.980
Minh Triet Vu: And you're gonna be the witness and you're gonna have to write it down for me that I've been taking medication Pingree have been good.

289
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.340
Minh Triet Vu: And

290
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.000
Minh Triet Vu: Let's put the joke aside and

291
00:31:54.030 --> 00:32:05.760
Minh Triet Vu: I think the main reason is because when everything when everything is is messy. I do want to at least myself. Stay discipline.

292
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.890
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, it's always. It's always one thing that I want. I think

293
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:20.880
Minh Triet Vu: I think a long time ago before all this I think discipline can make people happy.

294
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.460
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

295
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.470
I think you had discipline.

296
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.040
But I think it got

297
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.940
Shawn Phalen: I think it got a little bit confused for you because I think that

298
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.140
You remember we talked about how when you

299
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.890
When you were in school.

300
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:57.480
You were you tend, you were tending to over like doing extra work right.

301
00:32:59.160 --> 00:32:59.490
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

302
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.960
Minh Triet Vu: And when you when you did that extra work.

303
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.010
You're up for a couple of days trying to get at all. Finish.

304
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.800
Minh Triet Vu: And then that kicked you into a manic phase and then

305
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:25.110
You collapse because you're so tired. And so this is where the medication is going to really help you

306
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:34.320
And it's going to help with the the mania, it's going to help with the ups and the downs.

307
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:42.030
Shawn Phalen: So, um, you know, the goal is to where you start back at school and you don't get so

308
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.390
Like hyper focused and overwhelmed with all the work that you have to do.

309
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.520
And then not feeling like you have to over do

310
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:03.540
Think that's where caught you. We've got a little bit tricky for you this when you were trying to overdo which

311
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:10.740
Shawn Phalen: You know, which is very ambitious. That's just how you are. Anyways, you know, you're very ambitious new very hardworking

312
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.070
So,

313
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.510
Shawn Phalen: That's right, it's not safe to stop the medication.

314
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.530
Minh Triet Vu: somehow, somehow I have, I have a hunch that

315
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:49.830
Minh Triet Vu: When we when we meet regularly right like this you're trying, you're trying to you're trying to encourage me to explore myself and I do feel I do feel very grateful about that and

316
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.890
Minh Triet Vu: When I do when I do take a serious look at myself and I see. Oh.

317
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:20.130
Minh Triet Vu: So discipline is one of the things that I think is my redeeming trade. Yes. I think it's makes me. It makes me it, it separates me from other people. It's something that I can hang on to in order to stay

318
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.500
Minh Triet Vu: Unique exclusive maybe

319
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:36.660
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah, so I i just so when I found when I found when I found out about that. I tried to hang on to it even more.

320
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.980
Minh Triet Vu: And again it I think discipline itself is making me happy.

321
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.440
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah I list the things out and then I complete them.

322
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.720
Minh Triet Vu: In

323
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.460
Minh Triet Vu: India amount of time that

324
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:07.950
Minh Triet Vu: I think is sufficient enough for me to complete them. And once that happen once I achieved that I can happy.

325
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.460
Minh Triet Vu: Great. Yeah.

326
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:21.390
Shawn Phalen: So tell me some things that you've been staying busy doing what are some things that you've been doing

327
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:36.720
Minh Triet Vu: For once, I am helping with my parents because they are there are our jobs right now because of the pandemic. So I'm helping them and helping them asking for

328
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:56.850
Minh Triet Vu: You know, emergency insurance. I don't know, it's the amount of money that you can ask for when you're suddenly unemployed because of a crisis. So I'm helping them with that and I just actually I just finished my dad's

329
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:14.460
Minh Triet Vu: Applications The other day, I don't know the exact date and I'm going to finish my mother's to very, very soon. As soon as she is available, which she is not right now as I can see.

330
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.230
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, so I have been busy quite busy with that and also

331
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:33.480
Minh Triet Vu: Somehow, a couple of my plans. Suddenly, out of nowhere, getting sick and I have to

332
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.870
Minh Triet Vu: I have to take care of them seriously also

333
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.130
Minh Triet Vu: Hang on one second.

334
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:45.990
Minh Triet Vu: Yeah.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.670
Minh Triet Vu: Are you good

337
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:01.860
Minh Triet Vu: Good.

338
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.730
Shawn Phalen: So, so you're helping them file for unemployment, then

339
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:15.240
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, yes. Okay. That's correct. Okay. And how long have they been out of work.

340
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:21.990
Minh Triet Vu: Um, as far as for my dad's I think it's the start of March.

341
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:27.390
Minh Triet Vu: And as for my mom. I think she was let go last week.

342
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.940
And then have been moved.

343
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.700
New house.

344
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.470
Minh Triet Vu: Yes, we are actually we are at a new house.

345
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:56.070
Minh Triet Vu: I mean it's it's not the same place that they used to live in. Okay. This is where they're going to be living now this is where you are. Yes, yes. Okay.

346
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.040
Shawn Phalen: And then are you going to be seen with them.

347
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:09.990
Minh Triet Vu: No, no, I'm gonna return as long as soon as I finish. So again, there's nothing changed about my current situation, it just my family's situation.

348
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:22.260
Minh Triet Vu: So I think that's, that's also one of the reason I feel pretty calm, because it's not affecting me directly, but i do i i i am worried about them, actually.

349
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.060

Minh Triet Vu: It's so many there. There are so many unknown factors.

354
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:51.150
