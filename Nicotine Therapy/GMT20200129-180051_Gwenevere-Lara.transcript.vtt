00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.589
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel's Laura. Hi.

2
00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.020
Gabriel: Hi there.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.559
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I sure have been wondering how that that trip went. I know there were, it wasn't for a positive occasion, but what was that travel

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.140
Gabriel: To South Carolina.

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.390
Gabriel: Yeah, I mean, it was positive. My brother graduated from the Marine Corps.

7
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I do apologize I I planted a different story because it was a funeral.

8
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like,

10
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.590
Gabriel: No.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a positive thing. Okay.

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240
Gabriel: It was it was it was awesome. We have to get up early.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.780
Gabriel: My mother lives in North Carolina.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:12.270
Gabriel: So she drove down to Parris Island, South Carolina, where the Marine Corps basis and she got a big Airbnb house and we all stayed there and it was really cool. We barbecued and had a really good time.

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.950
Gabriel: Like to be with your family and get it was awesome.

16
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean I guess I just picture you sort of this sort of a lot of ways, kind of isolated and then to be around family.

17
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.500
Gabriel: What did you do, yeah.

18
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:41.490
Gabriel: What do you notice what's really cool. I took Ashley with me and the baby and my grandmother lives here in New Mexico and my mom hadn't seen her mom in a little while. So she flew out there with me.

19
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.930
Gabriel: And it was really cool. Everyone likes Ashley.

20
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.740
Gabriel: It was really fun.

21
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.310
Gabriel: It was really cool. We all hung out

22
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
Gabriel: We spent the last day in Charleston, South Carolina.

23
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.160
Gabriel: Which is right by the beach was really fun.

24
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.590
And

25
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.410
Gabriel: Now I'm back. Back to reality.

26
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And how was

27
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.320
Gabriel: How was the dynamic between you and Ashley when you were out there. It was nice. It was nice. She hasn't moments I think she's, uh,

28
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.790
Gabriel: I think she's like bipolar or something because sometimes. She's okay and sometimes. She's like, it's really strange.

29
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.910
Gabriel: So I don't know.

30
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.760
Go ahead.

31
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.680
Gabriel: At the same time, I think everyone is a little bit bipolar, just a little bit.

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's from that particular term has been sort of

33
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Normalize same way people use this word I'm anti social I don't think people would use it if they really knew what it meant.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I think people sort of use it in a non diagnostic way.

35
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you find yourself bipolar.

36
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.670
Gabriel: Um, you know, I feel like I

37
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.210
Gabriel: When I say Bipolar I think people have like mood swings, like I categorize the word. I feel like they're both synonymous.

38
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.960
Okay.

39
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.870
Yeah, so

40
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel like you have highs and lows that feel extreme

41
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.570
Gabriel: I think everyone does. Maybe not extreme but

42
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're the person of interest. Right. I mean,

43
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So what about you, what's it like for you to sit feel like they're more lows and highs or that it shifts on a daily basis or tell me about what it's like to be you these days.

44
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.210
Gabriel: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think my life is going okay um I moved into a new apartment. So that's pretty nice.

45
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.050
Oh,

46
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.500
Gabriel: It's nice.

47
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.890
Gabriel: We're on the top floor. It's a little more private um there.

48
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:18.180
Gabriel: There are 20 units in the building. There's a doorman at the bottom, there's complementarity coffee and snacks at the bottom.

49
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.060
Gabriel: There's a lobby.

50
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:45.690
Gabriel: It's very secure so on Monday, I was loading my son to take him to daycare before I came to work and I set my work back down to load him in and I drove to drop him off and I'm working in a neighboring town. It's like a small little town.

51
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.210
Gabriel: But it's definitely not Albuquerque. And I was about

52
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.360
Gabriel: 510 minutes away when I realized I forgot my bag. I left it near the car.

53
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:11.460
Gabriel: In the parking lot and I was so nervous and so scared and I drove all the way back there, really, really fast and it was still there.

54
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.250
Gabriel: An hour and a half later. Yeah.

55
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:25.200
Gabriel: And I was upset because I had my work computer in there and I signed a contract, saying, If I lose the computer, they're going to charge me $4,000 for it and then

56
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.000
Gabriel: My iPad was in their portable chargers headphones, all kinds of stuff.

57
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.850
Gabriel: And and they were still there, but had it been the other building. I lived in, it would have been gone for sure.

58
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.760
Gabriel: Yeah yeah

59
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had some some mixed feelings going on about moving in with Ashley, are you doing

60
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the reality of now that you've moved in. How you doing around that.

61
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.670
Gabriel: It's not too bad. Okay.

62
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.440
Gabriel: At the same time, I feel like I get real emotional sometimes

63
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.930
Gabriel: About things but

64
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.560
Gabriel: I don't know. Sometimes I feel like

65
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.890
Gabriel: I think into things too much.

66
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.550
Gabriel: And at the same time, like, maybe not.

67
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you know how to register, whether it's maybe a word like adaptive. You know how you say too much, or maybe it's too little, maybe it's fine.

68
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, how do you know whether you're thinking into and I might say analyzing how do you, how do you know it's adaptive

69
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning helping you right we you have that skill of analysis to serve us so that we can look to the future and and plan things in organizing need that skill. How do you know it.

70
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Adaptive versus ruminative where it's actually getting in the way. So how do you know whether it's helping you or hindering you

71
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.140
Gabriel: I don't think that I do know.

72
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.470
Gabriel: I don't think I've had that thought.

73
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you did just now. Right. I don't know if it's to lunch.

74
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.110
Gabriel: Yeah.

75
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we go there for a moment. Let's just different to see what are you really talking about

76
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.820
Gabriel: I just think that sometimes I overthink things

77
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.600
Gabriel: And then sometimes i think i don't

78
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.240
Gabriel: That make sense at all.

79
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't. So maybe

80
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.430
Gabriel: I guess.

81
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were overthinking don't you tell me a story about when you you assess yourself as maybe I was overthinking

82
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:53.850
Gabriel: I don't know. I think I'll just overthink things about my relationship that that you know what am I doing in this relationship. It's

83
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:08.640
Gabriel: It's very one sided I feel trapped. I made a bad decision. Okay. And then other times I think I'm so lucky to be in this relationship.

84
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.060
Gabriel: Yeah, well,

85
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so still pretty general let's see if we can get into a story about when you recently had this this experience of thinking too much and you had a summary of I feel trapped

86
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How recent lunch at what was going on.

87
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.660
Gabriel: Not, I want to say was

88
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.570
Gabriel: Maybe two weeks ago.

89
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.530
Gabriel: Okay, what was going on. Um, I just felt

90
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:52.320
Gabriel: You know, Ashley was at work and you know i was i don't know if you remember when we talked about how she deleted my social media and

91
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.300
Gabriel: All the phone numbers out of my cell phone and that sort of thing.

92
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:11.280
Gabriel: I was thinking that, you know, she probably has like her own like social media accounts that she logs into at work and like hide them behind my back and that sort of thing.

93
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we just take the fact that she deleted those two things just stay there.

94
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

95
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.750
Gabriel: What's your reference

96
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: For whether that is an adaptive um positive investment in a healthy relationship.

97
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.280
Gabriel: You know i i think

98
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:47.670
Gabriel: I don't know that I don't think that it is healthy because she should trust me by now. I'm going to shouldn't be like she does it. So I don't have contact with other women but

99
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.690
Gabriel: I mean, I will anyway you know

100
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. She can't actually control you.

101
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.620
Um,

102
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.010
Gabriel: But she tries to and if she doesn't get her way she gets upset, but

103
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.970
Gabriel: But remember,

104
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This is am I thinking too much.

105
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I thinking too much.

106
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't about thinking too much. Isn't this about what's okay with you and what is not so.

107
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that this person that you

108
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Are in a relationship with related

109
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Social media.

110
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And your phone numbers.

111
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask that again.

112
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.720
Gabriel: I'm sorry, I was just switching it to my headset.

113
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm asking you, I'm asking you, maybe the question.

114
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I different question might be,

115
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to decide what's okay and what's not okay for you.

116
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay

117
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That she removed social media and your contact numbers not analyzing her motivation that's that's that's irrelevant.

118
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just. Is it okay with you.

119
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.400
Gabriel: Know it's not okay.

120
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's it.

121
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

122
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned. Hey, by now. It would be nice if she had some trust. But what don't you like about the fact that she removed the social media and the phone numbers. Why is that something you don't like.

123
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.550
Gabriel: Oh well, I used to keep in contact with my family that lives in other states.

124
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.900
Gabriel: Okay, yeah. So that really bothered me because now I can't, you know, talk to them.

125
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.030
Gabriel: All the time, like they were right there. Like before I could just, you know, now I just feel

126
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.540
Gabriel: Like I have no one to talk to about anything.

127
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:07.620
Gabriel: I would have liked for to talk to me about it to say, look, you know, I feel like this is this and this is this and maybe we should try this.

128
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:14.430
Gabriel: Right, instead of her just going behind my back and doing it and you know that being that like that's not okay.

129
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.800
So now.

130
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So flip it over to what you do, like, what is it, because you ran into some moments with with Ashley on this trip. Sounds like you did like some things that were going on with her. What did you see that you liked

131
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.050
Gabriel: I just know that you know she's a nice person and

132
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.870
Gabriel: She cooked for me and

133
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.840
Gabriel: She told me nice thing.

134
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I should tell you that feels

135
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.060
Nice.

136
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.060
Gabriel: That she loved me.

137
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.580
Gabriel: That she cares about me.

138
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that to be true.

139
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.420
Gabriel: Yeah.

140
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.990
Gabriel: I mean, I'm sure there are moments just like you know everyone else in every relationship there are moments when

141
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.160
Gabriel: You can't stand up there in person. There are moments that you do.

142
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes I wonder if you're what's missing is some sort of reference point, as if it's almost like you can't sort of envision, what's a reasonable healthy sort of marriage, in a sense, it's almost like you're questioning it like a lot

143
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you're not trusting yourself.

144
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.270
Gabriel: Um,

145
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.130
Gabriel: Well, I mean, yeah, I guess in a way. My parents were divorced

146
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:06.510
Gabriel: But my, my uncle and onto been married for a long time and I lived with them when I was really young I asked them for advice and

147
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.440
Gabriel: They give us pretty good advice. Ashley and I

148
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.460
Gabriel: Know we see them know several times a year. They live in Los Angeles.

149
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of good advice. You're getting

150
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.430
Gabriel: Or you know that it's that it's going to be hard in a relationship that we're not always going to get along that

151
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.120
Gabriel: You know, you have to stick with it if you want it.

152
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.870
Gabriel: To last that's that's the way it is.

153
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.160
Gabriel: You know it isn't happiness all the time life like that doesn't exist.

154
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and that's what I'm getting at. I'm trying to say that I cannot quite see where your limit is

155
00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we here at least in here about these things that she's doing and you're wondering, you know, is this reasonable, where is this a diagnosis is this that she has something really wrong to I want to be with this person.

156
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Who have you talked to, or have you talked with anyone about her removing social media and your contact numbers from your phone that falls in sort of that other people's opinions about whether that's okay or reasonable

157
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.470
Gabriel: Say that again, I'm sorry.

158
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you talked with

159
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Us about

160
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.030
Gabriel: About that she did, she did that. Yeah, I've talked to

161
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.360
Gabriel: Talk to

162
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.760
Gabriel: My mom and she's like, well, I guess you don't really need social media.

163
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.290
Okay.

164
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Your phone fact that you don't have the contact numbers.

165
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:08.250
Gabriel: Yeah, I mean I guess I don't know. I don't think that I've talked to her about her. Yeah, she just laughed. She's like, haha funny.

166
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.100
Gabriel: But

167
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see this. Do you think she thinks it's cute.

168
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's what love looks like.

169
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.870
Gabriel: No thanks.

170
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And why is it cute.

171
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.050
Gabriel: I was trying to think about it. I

172
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.800
Know,

173
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is how you present in here. Right. It's everything is fine. We're good, we're good, we're good.

174
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we're not. We're good, we're not we're not we're not

175
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.810
We're good, we're good, we're good.

176
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And that might be what's confusing is you're able to really compartmentalize

177
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you shut off all the bad and you can focus on the good, but when it's bad. You shut off all the good

178
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You still hear me.

179
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.550
Gabriel: Yeah, yeah, that's a

180
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:19.740
Gabriel: Message.

181
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:21.570
From

182
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are your thoughts on what I just said.

183
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.220
Gabriel: I agree with you.

184
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more.

185
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.450
Gabriel: In regards to what you said.

186
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly not. What I didn't say

187
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.290
Gabriel: Well, I mean, I agree with you but

188
00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't about agreement Gabriel and want to know what you just did with that information if it's if you didn't hear me.

189
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.880
Gabriel: I heard what you said.

190
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why did I say

191
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:17.310
Gabriel: You said one. We're in here. It seems like everything is good. Everything is good. And then we talk and then everything's good. Everything's not good. And then everything's good again.

192
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.640
Okay.

193
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:36.270
Gabriel: And I agree with you. Yeah, I come in, in the last time I got in a fight. What I saw just now is last time we had this conversation. I went home and I got in a fight with Ashley because I told her. Oh, this isn't okay that you do all this. Hey, that's what I thought.

194
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I said, more and I said, I'm wondering if that's what it's like where you cut off.

195
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Other information. In other words, is only one thing at a time. It's all good. It's all fine. I don't want to think about any of the negative stuff.

196
00:18:52.710 --> 00:19:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when you can't stand it anymore, then it's all bad. And you can integrate a little bit of good which creates balance.

197
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And so for you. It may feel bipolar meaning of these two poles, good, bad, good, bad, good, bad, but it isn't that it isn't just, oh, I'm going to focus on the stuff, the way life is. Right. I mean, it's a lot more interweave with good about together.

198
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: they coexist.

199
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not all one thing you're not all one thing

200
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.160
Gabriel: Yeah, that makes sense.

201
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.670
Gabriel: Maybe I'll practice that next time I

202
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.250
Gabriel: Need to practice that next time on that.

203
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.190
Gabriel: Because I do do that I

204
00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:01.740
Gabriel: Do, do the, you know, whenever I'm upset. Everything is bad. Everything's bad but what you're saying is, remember things that are good, too.

205
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:03.810
Gabriel: But

206
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to be as intense, it won't feel like such a swing to the

207
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:18.360
Gabriel: Yeah, sometimes we get sick and nothing can make it right. And then it's like, and then this is wrong. This is wrong.

208
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.330
Gabriel: And I can't find anything. That's right.

209
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty common phenomenon. What people do once they're in a particular negative network. Let's say you've gone to this opposite, you're going to be scanning your environment looking

210
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: For more things people are doing to justify what you're already thinking and feeling about the situation.

211
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already looking for, let's say the negative you're scanning for Oh, she just did this. Oh, she just did that.

212
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do it to ourselves to

213
00:20:51.870 --> 00:21:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: If we're in a moment of perfectionism, and we're being hard on ourselves. We can be scanning for looking at my failure here. Look, I didn't do this and we can also in the opposite.

214
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Be minimizing some of our errors or some missteps and be just like I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, and not have a balance and self perception, either.

215
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Them or not, you know,

216
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's shift gears a little bit. I want to bring your attention to sort of a bit of preparation. I think down the line. I'd like to do some therapeutic intervention with you called em, Dr.

217
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And in order to do that I need to do some preparation. Okay.

218
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The preparation is therapeutic too. So it's a win win.

219
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to, I'm going to invite you right now to never remember whether people have been in the group at the time when I educated around the side the subjective unit of distress.

220
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds familiar. When I asked you to come up with a 50

221
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.830
Gabriel: Oh, yes, yes. Yeah.

222
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. Do you remember what that was. With that event that wasn't 100 meeting. I'm ready to punch or break something, or

223
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Run for my life. It wasn't that distressing and it wasn't a zero, which is just a relaxed body and and very, very little stress. So for you, 100 know pull it down to just a 50. Do you remember you can think of a new one. Something that you can still think straight

224
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not snow activating, you can still think

225
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be an event.

226
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's a memory and a level of distress at 50

227
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:51.000
Gabriel: Oh yeah, we had mentioned that it's when someone when I'm talking to someone and they don't. And they don't. And I asked him a question.

228
00:22:51.390 --> 00:23:01.230
Gabriel: And they're like, Oh, what, and I'm just like, dude, I've been talking for like two minutes. And that really upsets me but not like all the lights on it. But, so about 50 when I'm just like,

229
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I remember it now.

230
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.820
Gabriel: Yeah, that's that's alone.

231
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know anyone who does it on a regular basis that really you know maybe is superficially listening and sort of giving you a superficial answer really not listening at all. Do you know anyone that does that.

232
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.570
Gabriel: No, not really.

233
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.360
Gabriel: I remember the people that have

234
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.320
Gabriel: My friend Nick.

235
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.100
Gabriel: And

236
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.530
Gabriel: Myself. My mother's husband.

237
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.330
Gabriel: Cuz I just saw this past weekend and

238
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.530
Gabriel: You know, I see that he does it all time he's old

239
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.200
Gabriel: He's retired military so like, you know, maybe that's how they

240
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.960
Gabriel: Do it. I have no idea.

241
00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.260
Gabriel: That's about all that I remember actually does it sometimes, but she only does it

242
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:21.270
Gabriel: Will give me one second. I have to. I have an ignition interlock in my vehicle so I have to blow into it, it just to make sure that I'm not drinking alcohol.

243
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Sure. Thank you.

244
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.570
Gabriel: Okay, I'm back.

245
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You've mentioned that before. For some reason, in my mind, I didn't think you had any active cases, who's monitoring knows what court ordered that

246
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.600
Gabriel: No one I have it for my own self.

247
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You installed it

248
00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:01.620
Gabriel: Why you didn't have it for a long time. And before I had that before I joined the program. I was drinking and driving and I'm

249
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:09.600
Gabriel: And I talked to my mother and Ashley, Ashley doesn't drink, smoke, she will do anything. And I asked them if they think it was a good idea.

250
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:20.130
Gabriel: Ashley would know that I would drink and drive. And my mom didn't. And once I joined the program.

251
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.020
Gabriel: About

252
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.360
Gabriel: I want to say about four weeks in is when I had it installed.

253
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:36.480
Gabriel: Because that will guarantee that I can't because then I can't work. I can't do anything. So it's just an extra

254
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.420
Gabriel: You know, an extra motivator.

255
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.390
Gabriel: But no, I don't have any active cases or anything. Okay.

256
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.050
All right, thank you for that.

257
00:25:53.850 --> 00:26:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's go back to this sun. The sun scale. This is a basically a thermometer of temperature reading so that I have some idea of where your window of tolerance for distresses

258
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got Nick mother's husband and what's the emotion you feel when someone appears to not be listening to you.

259
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.930
Gabriel: I feel like

260
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.170
Gabriel: Like I don't matter.

261
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's clarify a little bit. I'm going to write down. I don't matter.

262
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And sort of in my world right in this therapy world. I will say,

263
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't matter is a belief.

264
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll track backwards. See if you can identify when you're busy thinking that living that as your reality. I don't matter.

265
00:26:48.810 --> 00:27:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Now see if you can label the emotion. It's going to be one word might be a combination of single emotions, but it's not going to be preceded by, like, it will be an emotion, try it on. For a moment I don't matter. How do you feel emotionally when you sit with that belief.

266
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.700
Gabriel: I feel sad.

267
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, absolutely. I guess that proof.

268
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Emotion is said

269
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How much you to track back

270
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in time.

271
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up from that memory bank that's her hippocampus. It stores lots and lots of information. I want you to pull up the earliest time with the most intense time

272
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have this awareness. I don't matter.

273
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.380
Gabriel: No good.

274
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You have it in your mind.

275
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing is that memory on a zero to 100

276
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.230
Gabriel: Like a 90

277
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That one's a lot stronger, isn't it, yeah.

278
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. How old were you

279
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.310
Gabriel: Maybe about six

280
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotion.

281
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.100
Gabriel: Painful

282
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Painful is it in that same sort of sad pain.

283
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

284
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you open to sharing, just a little bit about the context of that memory, what who it was with or what was going on, or is it too much to think about

285
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.490
Gabriel: Now I could share a little bit

286
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.190
Gabriel: My, my dad.

287
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Was he leaving

288
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:01.980
Gabriel: ignoring me

289
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I gotta tell you that ignoring of a little one. It really makes an imprint.

290
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

291
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Really makes a stamp.

292
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me tell you about kids.

293
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: They're adults. The grown ups are your hero, they're like God.

294
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:24.360
Gabriel: Man.

295
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're ignored.

296
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It can feel like death.

297
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So lonely helpless.

298
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be so awful. It doesn't surprise me that that is way deep in that memory.

299
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.610
Gabriel: Yeah.

300
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we don't want to be ignored. We need to be seen.

301
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.350
Gabriel: Really important. Mm hmm.

302
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so now I know

303
00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that one that gets it way up to 90. So let's come back down. I want you to have the experience of regulating around that kind of experience. Let's do this. Breathing together. Let's do this. Diagnostic breathing together.

304
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, let's feel better. Let's be in a relaxed body.

305
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing in through the nose.

306
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhaling out in the next in breath. I want you to be really clear that you send that air to the bottom of the longer you expand your belly out it's harder to do.

307
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.690
Yeah, here we go.

308
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll do a little box breathing. So on your INHALE, YOU READ IN FOR FOUR.

309
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then hold for 321 and the next time we'll do some holding. So on your inhale. So hold the breath of the top hold it there, hold, hold, hold, push it all out of your mouth flat tummy.

310
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Always wanted to hold it out, no air and the tummy or in the lungs. We got 1234 inhale through the nose. Push the belly out. Get that lung expanded at the bottom. Yep. You can hold it, hold, hold, and push it all out.

311
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that flat, flat, flat belly.

312
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Really keys that that air get put not up at the top of the long but down at the bottom.

313
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it again. Make sure you push that belly out as if that's what gets expanded, not the top. It's hard to do the top wants to expand. We want to get it down into the belly.

314
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. All the way out. And let's hold it no air at all for a count of 4321 and breathing in that air push it down at the bottom of the long so your belly pooches out

315
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and let it go. Push it all, though.

316
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You continue to do it. And I'm going to be talking to you about the importance

317
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the Vegas nerve that's wrapped around those organs underneath the diaphragm. We want that bottom of the lung pushing down on the diaphragm swooshing those organs down below it sends a signal up the Vegas nerve to the brain. Oh.

318
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: We're okay.

319
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing to be distressed over. There's actually no danger.

320
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be in a relaxed body as we recall some things that happened in the past because they're in the past.

321
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not happening right now.

322
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in a relaxed body and you are safe.

323
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really key that breath go into the tummy really like a Buddha, it just expands.

324
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't stay up at the top of the chest will have very little movement up at the top of the shoulders, because the air will be down low.

325
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: 80s and put your hands on your belly and have it expand as you breathe in and won't move much

326
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it is.

327
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it all go

328
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do another couple of those this time do that same thing fill that one up with the bottom. Let's push those hands. There it is. Okay.

329
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Pushing all out.

330
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me check in on you and see, see what number you're at right now we're up at 90 where you think you're at

331
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.380
Gabriel: I feel better.

332
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what number you think

333
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: went way down. So that's a great tool for you. Okay. And you can use that anytime right when it's starting to get extreme, you can use that. That's the real go to

334
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.620
Gabriel: Really good actually. Mm hmm.

335
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's the right that's that box breathing or you could call it diet for matic breathing. That is, you got science on your side there. That's not. You don't even have to believe in it for it to work. Okay.

336
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.000
So notice

337
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea of being ignored, right, the intensity of it can be attached to current triggers.

338
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it is. I think my best guess is, I have been able to trigger it. I've been able to do it a few times.

339
00:34:48.600 --> 00:35:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been able to almost piss you off or agitate you or I've watched right I've had some assumptions that I operate on and I'm like, oh, look what just happened. Right. Um, it can happen here. It can happen elsewhere.

340
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And the more you understand, oh my goodness this old network this old history just got activated something in the moment when someone's doing this thing and they're

341
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not paying attention to me or I don't think they are. I might be reacting this much with the potential threat of abandonment annihilation and terror have a six year olds response instead of this adult man that

342
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: People are busy. They get distracted, you know, they're running their own story in their heads.

343
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You are capable of being an independent man on your own. You actually don't need need the same way that little six year old did

344
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But it gets activated can feel just as horrifying. Okay, so that could be what's going on.

345
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

346
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Well, let's go the other direction. Let's go down to something that's really low, like what's the situation where

347
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember something kind of got to you what you were able to regulate on your own. And it might be a stress level of a 10 or maybe it was a 20

348
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what it was very low grade distress and definitely you were thinking you were probably in a great deal of a relaxed body and you were able to problem solve and self regulate you candle that moment. Can you think of a story.

349
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.020
Gabriel: Yeah, yeah, I remember. I remember when

350
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.410
Gabriel: Someone tried insulting me

351
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.000
Gabriel: And, like, try to like bully me

352
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.940
Gabriel: And like I just laughed at a half an hour just like whatever it is you're an idiot.

353
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nice. That feels good. Right. You didn't come unconscious, meaning that old memory of all those emotions. That's when we get a little unconscious. Right.

354
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.540
Gabriel: It's all that intensity

355
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Are able to to say to yourself, what in that moment when someone is talking smack and being a bully. What were you able to say about yourself.

356
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.230
Gabriel: Like that I used to be a bully, too. And I know what you're really thinking

357
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the bully actually really thinking

358
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.510
Gabriel: Yeah, exactly.

359
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I say

360
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:39.240
Gabriel: That they're insecure. So putting the trying to make me feel insecure because they're insecure.

361
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We do that, don't we

362
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.290
Yeah.

363
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.930
Gabriel: It was funny to me.

364
00:37:46.560 --> 00:38:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's walk this through there was this awareness of relating to the underlying right self concept of the bully. Oh, man. You're just insecure. So hold on to that we got that far. Now just imagine in order for you to do that to have that kind of self awareness.

365
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Inner personal awareness, you have to go back in time, you have to be humble. You have to say I was like that too. You don't get offended so many things were happening in that moment you were like you had the whole brain work and

366
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: One more question. See if we can find this one.

367
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: In order for you to have done that. What do you know about who you are. What's your belief about you in that moment.

368
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't I'm pretty sure I don't matter can pretty much tell you that wasn't one, you must have been running on a cognitive belief, a belief about the self.

369
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

370
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.140
Gabriel: I'm better than you at this moment.

371
00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:12.180
Gabriel: I'm better. I don't think that, you know, so you think I'm better than anybody. But at that moment while he's trying to make me like be little me like I'm bet I'm he's trying to do that because even he knows that I'm better than him at that moment.

372
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on.

373
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I do but but i think let's find let's refine it a little bit because you know you can tell it's not I am better than him. But you are more skilled at something. Let's see what that is.

374
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In that moment when you can hold on to yourself not defend it.

375
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have to defend it. You knew something to be true about you in that moment, and you didn't have to go. You didn't have to find with this guy over it. You didn't have to defend it. You have to explain it. You're just like, whatever.

376
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You knew something about you.

377
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you know about you to be true in that moment you take, take your time, don't rush at it quickly, this, this is a hard one to get to. We already ruled out better than we already know that's not it. It's something existed. I am what

378
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:08.010
Gabriel: Like, like, I want to say like more confident than he is at the moment more

379
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:13.950
Gabriel: I felt

380
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.930
Gabriel: Better like a like a better

381
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.620
Gabriel: I don't know what what's

382
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.680
Gabriel: The word I'm looking for, well,

383
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell you, I had already written the word confident down

384
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So my guess is that it's probably pretty true when you're in a space of confidence do you have a need to puff up bigger than you really are.

385
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: No, like a bully does right you know we don't need to do that. Do we will we, when we got self esteem, self confidence. We don't have anything to prove

386
00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We have our selves.

387
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't need someone outside of us to tell us. We're okay.

388
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We can self generate that

389
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you did a lot. All right. You did a lot. We've got three stories on this is sides thermometer. Here I've got, but I don't have a number to go with this this low grade one when someone was insulting you

390
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can give that a number in distress from zero to 100. What do we put it that one.

391
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.390
Gabriel: Like five. Okay.

392
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't at 10 I'm going to move it down.

393
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.890
Gabriel: I will. Yeah. And I definitely not saying more like five guy was a distressed at all.

394
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Now, look at that. This can inform how your days can go, you can say, well, you know what, I'm not an irritated defensive angry hostile guy when I remember

395
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good enough.

396
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.190
Just the way I am.

397
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now is fine. I don't

398
00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need to prove myself. I have confidence when you're in that mindset when that's the operating system with which you make decisions.

399
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The likelihood of you making one that you're going to regret or it'll be like too over the top, or maybe leave something when you really haven't thought it through or you'll attack something and you haven't thought it through my guess is when you're in that, you know, what's that thing.

400
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I'm feeling defensive and I'm attacking someone you might check yourself and go

401
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Which has happened to my confidence. Oh my gosh, I might be insecure about something right now. That might be a little space for you to explore

402
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can get to know why you might be reacting to people.

403
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, getting defensive or getting hurt or feeling threatened, any of those things right.

404
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You the work you can do because we can't control what other people do. We cannot, we might think we can we can we can sort of take a look inside ourselves and say, hmm.

405
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling a little insecure. I wonder what's coming up with that you can go to a reflection, you could go back in time and say, is this an old thing am I sensitive because of maybe an old hurt.

406
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything sit with it.

407
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's courage. When you sit with that discomfort and you don't blame someone else, you know,

408
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't call them names.

409
00:43:47.880 --> 00:44:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the middle way Gabriel, it's not polar, you're no longer running away from you, from what you're experiencing you're feeling your way through it and then guess what you do this over and over and over. You meet yourself there in your real feelings.

410
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no need for nothing.

411
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:15.480
Gabriel: How do I remember to do that in that situation.

412
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll tell you. I'll tell you what seems to be the best signal.

413
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a physiological response that happens, it cannot be broken down to the instantaneous signal that happens in the body. The body is going to react almost instantaneous as soon as someone if they even give you a look, your body will register, I'm being ignored.

414
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably because that's a heavy hitter for you, right. I'm not in right you'll register it so fast, something in your body's going to get activated.

415
00:44:49.860 --> 00:45:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tight throat gut turning shoulders up sweaty palms tense, clip the fist, but something happens, and that's where the investigation can be, you start to take a look at how you actually feel physically because it will happen before you'll actually have the thought, way before

416
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The thalamus registers that this physiological experience.

417
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The middle of sort of has that emotional is this danger is this danger is this danger. These are really close to each other. The long distance. The part of the brain, way down here, it has to travel all

418
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The way up here as such a long way to go before it can find a word to describe what the heck is going on your body is going to know immediately.

419
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's time to turn attention to that because notice how good that breathing felt that's body work that's getting into this relaxed body. We went somewhere, psychologically, didn't we, and I invited you to free then to the body. We're not exactly breathing into our brain right

420
00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we don't have to. They are connected. Everybody thinks there's just like we're cut off from the neck down, it's not connected to the rest of us.

421
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's connected and it's connected, especially with the Vegas nerve Vegas nerve sends a signal to the brain when you're breathing like that there's no danger because who could breathe like that no one could be like that when there's a lion tiger beer. No one can't do it.

422
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're up here. When you're in your dukes are up and you're ready to go.

423
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: We're wired to regulate

424
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Our body knows what to do pay attention to it signals happening instantaneous. The next time you're hanging around. So the answer your question, pay attention to how your body feels

425
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you're like in a social situation attention to what it's like to be around Ashley, for example, notice

426
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: She just gave me the stink eye. Oh, she's got her back to me. How's my body feel start there. Start the investigation there and come back and you tell me, tell me a group

427
00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell everyone in group. Tell me an individual therapy journal it send a text, whatever you need to do. Let's find out.

428
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What gets activated, because it is going to be an amazing place to find out. Oh, we can check in there. Now we know where you get

429
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That that first response. Like I said, for me, I happen to know it's right here, I have to glands right here and they sting. It's the weirdest thing for some people to hurt right they get those you could yuki stomach.

430
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And another people right and they'll catch themselves in the big clenching their teeth catch yourself. Pay attention. Let's find out where that body is registering it because it's going to be a great place for future investigation because you want to know where to begin.

431
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a great place. Pay attention to your body. It knows something important is going on.

432
00:47:53.610 --> 00:48:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, I'll get into all the communication stuff and cut negative cognition, I can get into all of that, but your body's really important

433
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you did some hard work in here, man.

434
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.200
Gabriel: Yeah, it was great. It was really enjoyed our session.

435
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.970
Gabriel: Yeah, we move forward with this. I'm enjoying the more and more. Yeah.

436
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright.

437
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:28.680
Gabriel: I honestly feel like I'm getting things out before it was like Okay, let me get through this. And I know that I'm paying attention. I feel like I'm actually getting something out of it.

438
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.480
Gabriel: Right.

439
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember what you just said, I'm paying attention. So you're feeling good. You are getting meaning out of it, but you have to pay attention right

440
00:48:45.900 --> 00:49:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can't ignore you gotta lean into it bravely with curiosity and you will get the meat, you'll get something useful, but we can't do it cavalier, we can't do it as a side thing. This takes full attention. You deserve this full attention.

441
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It will feel good and healing and nourishing for you.

442
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Two weeks from now.

443
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that puts us at February 12 if you like this at 11 o'clock I can put you right there and then

444
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not sure what those look like look ahead on your calendar and let me know you know maybe a group and say, hey, that's not going to fit the sooner I know that better than I can kind of shuffle people around. Okay.

445
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.490
Okay.

446
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.040
Gabriel: Do you need me to send a message.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:50.550
Gabriel: Oh yes, if he can get my medication for Thursday and Friday.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.910
Gabriel: Because he bridged my medication until today.
