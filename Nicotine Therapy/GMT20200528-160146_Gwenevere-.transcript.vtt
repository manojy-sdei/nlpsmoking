Cynthia We: That was really loud.

4
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

5
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't yell at this time.

6
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.510
Cynthia We: I got it.

7
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I got her better better

8
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, good, good, good, good, good. All right.

9
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in. I'm in Santa Fe.

10
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I flew on Monday.

11
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.660
Now,

12
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.490
Cynthia We: Really

13
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.180
Cynthia We: During this time, aren't you nervous.

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.140
Um,

16
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I am I flew with my youngest and we more mass I carried around a big blob of Clorox and he weren't gloves and I wipe the seats down or wipe the handles down and waited. Once I heard that the viral load basically needs to be as much as it's like a sneeze on

18
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.830
Cynthia We: That amount. Oh.

19
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like,

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta get out of this House.

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.480
Cynthia We: Yeah, I was worried about flying in September, but, um, maybe I don't have to worry

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, keep an eye on me.

23
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A second and we know

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad either one, a very

25
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Conservative

26
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure I figure for me to have reconciled myself.

27
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'm in line with the rest of the community, because as I've come out. I'm noticing shops are opening

28
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.690
Cynthia We: I oh yeah yeah

29
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.500
Cynthia We: Open here.

30
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's starting to open up. So with that, let's focus on you a little bit here. So, um, why don't we kind of bring me up to speed house chicken house, Scott. How are you, how's all a lot

31
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.880
Of

32
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.590
Cynthia We: Chicken is

33
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.010
Cynthia We: A he's not doing very well he is. This is hard for him, and we

34
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: He was going to get a playdate did he get to play.

35
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.340
Cynthia We: Yes, yes, they went bike riding on trails last weekend.

36
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.960
Cynthia We: Good and

37
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.600
Cynthia We: He's going to, we're going to go back over to Sams and

38
00:02:46.740 --> 00:03:05.850
Cynthia We: Sam's house and let them hang out and the lowest going to hang out again. So that's what's to happen. It was supposed to happen today, but then Sam announced service fee up front allowed us to his mouth that he had 13 math assignments do that. We're just assigned

39
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

40
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.850
Cynthia We: Two days before school that out.

41
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.190
Cynthia We: What I like whoa that's awfully suspicious. And that sounds a lot like Keegan

42
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: 1313 assignments assigned

43
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.010
Cynthia We: Yeah. Yeah, right.

44
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.630
Cynthia We: So she's like, I don't know what to believe anymore. And I'm like, Well, I wouldn't believe that but I also wouldn't worry about it.

45
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.720
Cynthia We: You know he's usually a really good student really good kid. This is the, this is like a different time.

46
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked about that last time that this is

47
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, more flexible.

48
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So yeah, that makes sense.

49
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:54.060
Cynthia We: So, um, he and Scott got into it. The other night, and it was are really scary and dramatic and so

50
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.910
Cynthia We: Scott, this was two nights ago and Scott sat down yesterday and said that he will go find somebody get some help for his

51
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem really

52
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.060
Cynthia We: Yeah.

53
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad

54
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.160
Cynthia We: Me too.

55
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

56
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah. Good thing, Cindy. That's a good

57
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.770
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's very good.

58
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.210
Cynthia We: Okay, it's very good.

59
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.460
Cynthia We: It was, it was really

60
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how are you. How are you, and Scott taking care of the emotional impact of that argument with Teague and how are you taking care of him. How are you taking care of low on that psychological, emotional level.

61
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.810
Cynthia We: I hug Lola and I stayed with her on that night. Well, every night lows been sleeping in her own room. Finally,

62
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.220
Cynthia We: And I'm so I've been going and link that link down but just sitting at the edge of the bed while she falls asleep.

63
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.000
Cynthia We: But that night I like Hugger and and told her it was okay shouldn't have to be scared.

64
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.590
Cynthia We: Um,

65
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:09.750
Cynthia We: And we talked about it a little bit yesterday that that my dad kicked a hole in my door. When I was a teenager.

66
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.940
Cynthia We: Is the famous whole it's still there. Everybody's seen it, and everybody knows this is from when Cynthia was a teenager.

67
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:36.390
Cynthia We: The only time I did really lost control and I'm, you know, I said, sometimes people get really mad, and it doesn't mean that they're going to hurt you. It just means that they are really mad, and it doesn't have to mean that that's ever going to happen again. Scott, he kicked

68
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.940
Cynthia We: Kicked a cooler and it it somehow hit the dishwasher. So a bunch of things broke

69
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was very scary and loud.

70
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.030
Cynthia We: And it seemed like he's through something

71
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:59.040
Cynthia We: You know towards Teagan but he didn't he, you know, he was an accident, based on his

72
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.620
Cynthia We: You know he's, he's like, it was done with me to kick the cooler. But I didn't throw any classes.

73
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.680
Cynthia We: I'm

74
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.480
Cynthia We: Anti gun.

75
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.110
Cynthia We: I talked to him that night and

76
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.650
Cynthia We: He was pretty freaked out that that Scott was that mad.

77
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.210
Cynthia We: And

78
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.040
Cynthia We: Then he just went and he laid down so I don't think I really did take care of. Okay.

79
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You can

80
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.010
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's still good.

81
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you, what about the the the sort of your little girl inside. How is it doing having seen that aggression around you.

82
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.060
Cynthia We: Um,

83
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.820
Cynthia We: I did some meditation I signed up for 10% happier.

84
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.760
Cynthia We: Do it. That's a meditation program. Right. Um, and I feel like I'm okay.

85
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.910
Cynthia We: We had a really good talk yesterday afterwards. So I feel like that helped a lot.

86
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you just cross compare that conversation with once you've had in the past with Scott and let me know how it's different. How you what you noticed about yourself in that conversation versus maybe how you were 678 months ago.

87
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:35.970
Cynthia We: I feel like I was really able to listen to him because it wasn't my argument so

88
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:46.200
Cynthia We: I didn't feel like I had to defend my actions or anything. It was between Tina and Scott and so I was really able to like stay present

89
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.750
Cynthia We: During the conversation.

90
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.880
Cynthia We: About it. And, um,

91
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.160
Cynthia We: I don't know that I've been able to lay I really noticed it. I really noticed that I was able to do that. And I was able to like

92
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.860
Cynthia We: I have my whole brain with me.

93
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, nice.

94
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.720
Cynthia We: Yeah, very different.

95
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.300
Cynthia We: Very different from me, most of the time.

96
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you getting what I'm saying that we want all the parts of our brain working, not just

97
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared I'm scared I'm yes yeah

98
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

99
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This works so much better.

100
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When we still have access to not only our emotional motivation. I want my family to be healthy, happy. But I also want to access to logic, reason and memory storage, you know, we want access to all the cool parts of our brain that's neat that you, you got to witness that

101
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:41.760
Cynthia We: Yeah.

102
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a little pass because it wasn't about you.

103
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.740
Yeah.

104
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:50.790
I love

105
00:08:54.030 --> 00:09:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: My accounts, it counts. It counts because oftentimes I think what you do is you you you either kind of do this dissociation thing from it or you align with one side or the other you just sort of align with one

106
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.880
Cynthia We: Yeah.

107
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you were able to sit back and you could hear both sides, you were able to sit with both points of view.

108
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.850
Cynthia We: Um yeah well and scout, was he was mad at me because

109
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:33.960
Cynthia We: He asked me that night if he was yelling. Cuz, cuz sequins big thing was that he accused him of yelling or getting angry in its face, and, um,

110
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.790
Cynthia We: I

111
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.180
Cynthia We: He came and asked me.

112
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.500
Cynthia We: And I'm like, well, yeah, you saw an angry and

113
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.990
Cynthia We: I don't know, like he didn't he, that wasn't the response. He was looking for.

114
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:58.470
Cynthia We: I guess he wanted me to say that he didn't sound angry, so that we would be alive, we would be on the same team. He felt that I was

115
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.960
Cynthia We: A good going against him by saying that I didn't mean that.

116
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:17.370
Cynthia We: I forget what the question was because we were asked a specific question that I was bringing up reason for you. Remember, no.

117
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, mostly. Go ahead.

118
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.590
Cynthia We: No, go ahead and

119
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were actually saying that, you know, originally I was saying. Were you able to see

120
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.640
Cynthia We: Both points info. Yeah.

121
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.600
And

122
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you brought

123
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: While he was. Yeah. He actually came to you and

124
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.960
Cynthia We: So I guess like in the moment you're frozen. Oh, sorry if I just

125
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.060
Oh now.

126
00:10:49.110 --> 00:11:07.770
Cynthia We: I can see you now. Um, so, yes. In that moment, like I was, I feel like I was able to see both sides, but I did see that Scott was he was mad and and he was speaking in a tone that wasn't necessarily young, but it was angry and

127
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:16.350
Cynthia We: I understood what he was saying, you know, because he's come at me like that before. And he sounds mad.

128
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.970
Cynthia We: And so you react appropriately. Oh, no. Oh.

129
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got dark

130
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.020
Cynthia We: Shadows gonna go bark at the neighbor.

131
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:33.480
Cynthia We: Kid in the House said he doesn't know that the neighbors guide dog is out here. They have a

132
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.150
Cynthia We: Have a very bad relationship.

133
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:46.890
Cynthia We: So he told me about that the next day and i i i could see. I could see what he meant.

134
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.000
Cynthia We: And even though he was

135
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.280
Cynthia We: critiquing my, you know, my answer. I still was able to stay present with it which that's

136
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:06.150
Cynthia We: Cool. How I don't know that I would have answered and definitely like a heated sounding groups.

137
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:07.830
Cynthia We: But

138
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That means you have an opinion and what you didn't do. So here's maybe what how it might have gone

139
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: He's mad at me to that.

140
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy.

141
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, and you would have gotten small and

142
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, huh, small cry.

143
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And the, sort of, but that that

144
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The victim, a little bit like

145
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What a one down and shame would have been Rolling. Rolling. Rolling. Rolling, rolling

146
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it would have just kept reinforcing

147
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have a voice and it'll always be like this. And it's hopeless. I think

148
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

149
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But now it looks like what you did was good. See, I have empathy for my son, boy, and I've been there.

150
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Many looked over at your husband and it just happens to be that you felt yourself.

151
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I would, I kind of feel like, Dude, this guy's angry and I don't really want to go towards him. So there's a withdrawal when people are angry. We don't unless you want to fight, but most people kind of want to pull back. So you notice

152
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She had empathy for Tegan and then interestingly he came to you and asked you, How am I presenting and you help and you answered. You didn't say something like, well, you already know or you know you didn't do

153
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, you play a game. You said

154
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of add to, and he

155
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you didn't fall apart.

156
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.420
He stood there in

157
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: There in your truth and then it went. Then you saw in his face. He didn't like that answer.

158
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you use your brain, right, you're like, oh, he wanted me

159
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To be aligned with him.

160
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But no, no. Right there. What happened then. So he didn't get what he wanted, you held on to your truth just break it down to the next like 60 seconds. What happened after that.

161
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.170
Cynthia We: That's when he got really mad and said,

162
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:24.840
Cynthia We: Beloved gallon. This is what yelling sounds like any screen like at the top of his lungs.

163
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And why did you do

164
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.420
Cynthia We: I was like,

165
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:38.280
Cynthia We: I was just in shock. Like I it seems to go to come out of nowhere because he was mad, but it wasn't like that bad.

166
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.990
Cynthia We: Usually there's some preparation. I stayed there and Lola freaked out.

167
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.550
Cynthia We: And she hit under the table.

168
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:56.430
Cynthia We: Maybe I and and that's when the glass. You know the thing got kicked in the glass broken you ran out. And then I looked back to see if it was okay. And, um,

169
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:13.170
Cynthia We: And I got loaded to come up and sit on my lap. I felt like I held it together. I'm Scott critique was that I was detached that I was detached and disconnected. And I'm like, I don't feel like that. I feel like I was holding myself together.

170
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.120
Cynthia We: Okay, yeah.

171
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay right there so

172
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:25.950
Cynthia We: I felt very like, and I don't know what I don't understand what's different. Why I guess maybe because it wasn't towards me, necessarily, but I'm very

173
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.760
Cynthia We: Aware and blown away by the difference. Yeah, of how that feels.

174
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So you stay grounded.

175
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You could see the insanity now.

176
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You took care of your children.

177
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not make it about you. You did not do that you just did. The next thing.

178
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That needed you did the urgent things that needed urgent attention. And that's the psychological well being of your children because this is a grown man who's losing

179
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: He had it's not for you to solve.

180
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:05.880
Cynthia We: He's not

181
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you took care of the people that needed to be taken care of and you maintained your truth. You didn't back down and didn't change it.

182
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're proud of that. I hope

183
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.490
Cynthia We: I'm super proud. Yeah.

184
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.090
Yeah.

185
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:22.680
Cynthia We: I'm

186
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:28.140
Cynthia We: Like super impressed or like just yeah it's very different.

187
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now watch this. Because you changed because you stood here, shoulders back, in a sense, metaphorically hands on the hips. I know what I know what I know.

188
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I know.

189
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What I know

190
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And you stood there, you didn't play victim. You didn't get snow and you didn't rage back. I don't think

191
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: No. So, watch, watch what happened.

192
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You got labeled stay with this nice and slow.

193
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay attached

194
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When you yell back he feels you are engaged.

195
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.440
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

196
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When you withdraw. He knows he has affected you and you are engaged when you stay in your truth it is on

197
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Pleasant for him. You have to understand that is so foreign for him.

198
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.690
Cynthia We: Yeah.

199
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What that looks like to him is you are utterly abandoning him.

200
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.140
Cynthia We: Yeah.

201
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, but you're the one change in the rules. He didn't ask for all this. He's about to is going to go get some help and he's going to learn all these things. I pray, he gets a decent therapist. There's a lot that suck.

202
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So please. Good grief. If they start coming at you with hackneyed things that everybody already knows and you don't get to core family origin things and he's not coming away with any new skills get somebody else.

203
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.080
Okay.

204
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's a very common phenomenon. Right. So it's beautiful that you remember that word because that's how it felt. He felt alone and and and you think that's mad. I'll show you what Matt is I was keeping it together before. So this was a man coming to you for validation

205
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he was insecure. He was uncertain.

206
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did everything beautifully. Do you want to know a note, if you wanted to be a therapist in that moment, if you wanted to even bring it up another notch.

207
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: When he said

208
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I sounding bad when I'm talking to Tegan

209
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have said.

210
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling right now. It's got what's going on right now, man. How's it feel when you're talking with Tikkun

211
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Not answering his question but getting to the underlying

212
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.780
Cynthia We: It was mad. You said bad

213
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe.

214
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he would have said.

215
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm frustrated

216
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see, because all y'all interpret that because inside of him, he might actually be doing his best. And you know what you guys all said to him, it's not enough.

217
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't mean to and it isn't. But when we're in it. When we're he may already been trying to regulate

218
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And hmm

219
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.180
Cynthia We: And Daddy news. Yeah.

220
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Already trying and it's still y'all see it as mad.

221
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, tell you what man really looks like so that when I

222
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just frustrated

223
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:45.570
Right.

224
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if we can get. Do I look mad.

225
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What, how are you feeling that's like, are you okay. Is there anything I can do to kind of support you through this what's going on for you.

226
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How are, how are it. How's it feeling to be you.

227
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Now watch. I'm not detached I care. I'm asking. I'm not giving him as the worst answer which is yeah you're mad, which is not what he wanted to hear.

228
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: He was

229
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're, you're super dad right now you're holding it together so nicely done.

230
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We didn't get that.

231
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now, there's really cool things that happened. He trusts you. He came to you.

232
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but look by just changing

233
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You staying in your truth.

234
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: He can feel it and he's he's, he's the normal thing he now has nothing to fight he has nothing to punch. And so he kicked an object. It had nowhere to go.

235
00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you weren't presenting with this or he couldn't continue to yell at you. So you change the dynamic profoundly by just that thing you did by standing in your truth.

236
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty cool huh

237
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.480
Cynthia We: It's very cool.

238
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.220
Cynthia We: Read about that happening, but I don't believe that I've ever

239
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.650
Cynthia We: Ever experienced it.

240
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.830
Cynthia We: You know, we're one person changes the

241
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.900
Cynthia We: Dynamic changes. Yeah.

242
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: System that that's every system now. Now when I say that they're also can be an amplification of forcing it to go back to the norm. So there's an escalation. Oh, right. You're going to go back to

243
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I'll show you. Scary so that you

244
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Get back into victim.

245
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But it while you held on to yourself you fought that and you you you could, you can go into problem solver. You can go into coach. You don't have to go into persecutor you know that drama triangle. You don't have to be persecuted victim anymore.

246
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't have to be the hero, you can just be coach you can be problem solver. You can be advocate, you can care. You can care about your husband is in distress.

247
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very

248
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: you threaten to me. You're threatening to, oh my gosh, right, you can feel like I hate it when I'm so unraveled and having it all. I hated myself.

249
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you okay, is there anything I can do to kind of help you through this, you know, care.

250
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Opposite.

251
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Of fear.

252
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.960
Cynthia We: Yeah.

253
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You kicked ass girl.

254
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.040
Tao.

255
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.790
Cynthia We: Why am I getting an echo in my ear.

256
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.880
Cynthia We: Know he's gotten me me me

257
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Me so I'm thrilled that he's he's he's seen in himself. Something where he wants to address it. That's great.

258
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.260
Cynthia We: Yeah, you know, he comes from his mom I once

259
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.980
Cynthia We: Thought it was very strange. She yelled at me about something and then like

260
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.940
Cynthia We: Five minutes later went back to normal.

261
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:25.170
Cynthia We: And it was so foreign to me that I i said to Scott like i and then I watched like her God fight and then go back to normal, it's like how they grew up was very normal to to

262
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:37.620
Cynthia We: Really be added express yourself and then purchase to love everybody. And that's, like, not how was in my house like you got mad at me to talk for hours.

263
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.000
Cynthia We: But it's just interesting to see the different

264
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.370
Cynthia We: Dynamics. Yeah.

265
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:57.870
Cynthia We: So, so to him. I'm speaking in a loud voice isn't yelling. To me it feels like yelling. So I call it yelling and and he's like, I'm not actually

266
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.640
Cynthia We: Set it feels like yelling because you're mad.

267
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So that it comes to a conversation of Scott, does it matter to you that it is experienced as yelling and you just sit there for a minute.

268
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Doesn't matter to you.

269
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That I experienced that high volume as yelling, does it matter to you.

270
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.510
Cynthia We: I bet he would say yes.

271
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay then. And then you flip it around and he gets to say, Does it, does it matter to you that I

272
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I, I don't know any other way to be this is, I feel like I'm being normal right now. Does it matter that

273
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That to you that I'm doing the best I can, like, I'm, I'm doing regular communication. Like I feel like I'm doing a great job doesn't matter. You know, and then he gets to ask you those things and

274
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Does not one right way notice each of your family.

275
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Will just so slightly different but if it matters. Then we get to modulate we get to go. Okay.

276
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you hear me as yelling at you right now. And he gets to check in and you get permission to be able to say

277
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell you're trying to communicate you doing doing it the way you know but

278
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going in, like yelling, it's going in.

279
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't hear what you're saying anymore. I'm kind of getting anxious

280
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we give it some time or maybe let's write a note or can we start whispering and see if just for fun, because then we know we won't be yelling

281
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a whisper.

282
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:48.480
Cynthia We: Good idea.

283
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend to be funny. Very funny. Well, let's pretend that we just lost our voices.

284
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the giggles there then anything's possible right

285
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.050
Yeah.

286
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's Do you care.

287
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.660
Cynthia We: Yes.

288
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this how your communication style is going in.

289
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it matter because it's the responsibility.

290
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the communicator rephrase

291
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.190
To change.

292
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

293
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.780
Cynthia We: He would say it's my responsibility.

294
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.500
Yeah.

295
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication is a really complicated thing.

296
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not one side or the other. I'm well aware that that no matter how good a communication someone deliver something I can have my

297
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: My filter on so tight that nothing gets through. I know that.

298
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This is pre supposing

299
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Some plus or minus of health.

300
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

301
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I i have a I'm motivated by an emotion to communicate something to you.

302
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have an idea of the language. I'm going to use. I assume you know these words. And so then I say them to you and I watched your face. And if your face doesn't match.

303
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What I was kind of my the emotion. I was trying to get your face to look like. Then I need to get your face to match my intention. So I got to get you there. And that's on me.

304
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I believe.

305
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's assuming a modicum of health.

306
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.320
Right.

307
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

308
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I do think i think he needs individual therapy, I think.

309
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Couples where you guys could revisit

310
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a commitment to using

311
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel have permission to be able to say to one.

312
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.420
Another

313
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear you right now. So I'm getting activated. Can we do one of the skills can be

314
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Script send a quick text instead for just five exchanges, can we write it down. Can we use these my emergency last I don't know whether you guys got that thing laminated. I don't know what you guys have done.

315
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we do these other things so that we can get through how we're both feeling right now, but it takes a commitment to do it.

316
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, both of you are right now you're doing yours.

317
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.330
Cynthia We: I am

318
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.550
Cynthia We: And I feel like I'm

319
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:57.330
Cynthia We: Like you know he did say that he would get there before. It didn't then suddenly it wasn't a thing. Um, but I do feel like like because it came from him this time rather than be saying, I think you need to go see a therapist.

320
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.180
Cynthia We: Or asking him to do it.

321
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.250
Cynthia We: I think he'll do it.

322
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.220
Cynthia We: I will help him find somebody, but

323
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.810
Cynthia We: Just because I know how

324
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

325
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:22.170
Cynthia We: Um, it's Keegan's therapist offered to do it. And I thought that was too awkward. I thought that was very nice of him but but also a little awkward.

326
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.650
Cynthia We: It's just feels a little

327
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a dual it's a, it's a, it's a bit of a conflict of interest is what it is.

328
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That

329
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very rigid around that.

330
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I know, I know some therapists do that.

331
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They strike some sort of balance with it, but

332
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what chickens going to always wonder in the back of his head.

333
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:44.940
Cynthia We: Yeah.

334
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and stuff from dad that's

335
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Tainted his therapist perspective and unconditional regard in the back of his little head and I would I would worry

336
00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:01.860
Cynthia We: Yeah, and Teagan trusts him so much. And really, really like so, and I wouldn't want

337
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:13.170
Cynthia We: To do anything to that relationship. So I think Greg is is very good. Like when I go in with Tegan and we'll

338
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:13.800
Cynthia We: Talk.

339
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.320
Cynthia We: He's very good. I'm not picking a side, it's not showing that he's picking aside. Yeah.

340
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.130
Cynthia We: Saying job.

341
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.540
Cynthia We: Yeah, thank you.

342
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.790
Cynthia We: But, um,

343
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:31.950
Cynthia We: Yeah, I thought it was nice city offered bit and I think because he offered because I attributed the

344
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.110
Cynthia We: See

345
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.080
Cynthia We: Extra anger to grief over his mother.

346
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:48.000
Cynthia We: It doesn't really matter where it came from. The fact is it's there and taken as a huge trigger and I'm a huge trigger

347
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.990
Cynthia We: Are you frozen again.

348
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it's coming up for you.

349
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

350
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.910
Cynthia We: No, you're the, oh, you're not moving, but I

351
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.080
Cynthia We: Can't hear you see me.

352
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, frozen huh huh

353
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.480
Cynthia We: Oh, just for a minute there.

354
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.450
Cynthia We: So tell me, what does a pleasant look on your face.

355
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.890
Cynthia We: Like oh

356
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.240
Cynthia We: Well, but

357
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what else is going on for you.

358
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.760
Cynthia We: I'm

359
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.720
Cynthia We: Oliver is asking, Scott to work again.

360
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.500
Cynthia We: Oliver's the guy that didn't pay him all that

361
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.810
Cynthia We: I'm just like, no, just just

362
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:38.940
Cynthia We: Just so

363
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:41.790
Cynthia We: Just so

364
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now things are going to start to open up. Is he here.

365
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: He might be able to go on set and whatnot.

366
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.710
Cynthia We: He sat in on a log meeting the other day about

367
00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:00.000
Cynthia We: What they could do about keeping people off set. So he's going to have a

368
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:06.630
Cynthia We: He's almost got a guaranteed job on set because he'll be responsible for sending

369
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:12.360
Cynthia We: If people are going to zoom in, you know, because usually a set has like 250 people on it.

370
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:30.000
Cynthia We: So they're going to try and do it differently, where people might be either off site or stay in their trailers so that they won't be around the stars and the main center of action. So Scott will be responsible for sending that signal out

371
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:48.660
Cynthia We: Which is good because you know video is usually only a job that's I'm big movies and sometimes series, but it's not always included in TV stuff. It would be great if it was because then there would be enough work for everybody.

372
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:57.540
Cynthia We: For all the video, guys. Yeah. Um, but, but he hasn't heard anything specific. Oh, he did do.

373
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:08.610
Cynthia We: He did the. Thank you. He cut it together to Netflix for paying their salaries for the first several weeks they put a fun together. I paid everybody

374
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.710
Cynthia We: They paid everybody for like six weeks, I think.

375
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.910
Cynthia We: Nice um it was

376
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:34.560
Cynthia We: a godsend. So they took Scott collected, everybody. He had everybody from the show and print out a sign and then showed them grabbing the sign from top up top.

377
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:46.290
Cynthia We: Or to the left and then passing it so that it looked like each screen passed it to the next person who put this all together. Scott and and he cut it together and

378
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:57.450
Cynthia We: And sent it out and Netflix was like bowled over they he blew them away. And I guess it's all over Facebook Adam saw it on Facebook, the guy that he works for

379
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:08.220
Cynthia We: Um, and didn't know that Scott cut it together. Oh, and Scott's the funniest in there because his video, he snaps on a pair of blue gloves before he grabs the side

380
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:32.580
Cynthia We: Is very funny. But he did a really good job. And that's like a like a creative thing. So I think there's even more reward people loving what you do if if it's something like that. Um, so anyway, they did. They say sent it to the whole company. They were completely blown away and

381
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:37.080
Cynthia We: He's proud of himself so

382
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You seem proud of him to

383
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:42.780
Cynthia We: I'm super proud of them. Because that's a

384
00:34:44.880 --> 00:35:00.330
Cynthia We: Here's a creative guy and I think they had things like having not had kids, there are a whole bunch of S. He was working at a production company editing when we got both got fired from our jobs so

385
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:11.400
Cynthia We: His goal was always to be an editor, because he's very good at seeing the overall picture and take you the pieces and putting them together.

386
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:18.360
Cynthia We: But he wasn't able to pursue that because we were drug addicts and he got fired.

387
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:21.060
Cynthia We: So maybe

388
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: These are starting to emerge. That's exciting.

389
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.360
Yeah.

390
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:25.920
Cynthia We: Yeah.

391
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.210
Cynthia We: What about his

392
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Side. What about your writing.

393
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.690
Um,

394
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:33.510
Cynthia We: Yeah.

395
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.700
Cynthia We: I

396
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:47.400
Cynthia We: I wrote that one essay, um, you know, few weeks ago or a couple months ago, and then how God gave me a great idea to weave it into a

397
00:35:51.660 --> 00:36:09.630
Cynthia We: abraded essay and then sent me an example of a braided essay for one of her mentors, which made me cry because it was so good. And, um, and so above and beyond what I believe I'm capable of putting together like like just

398
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.930
Cynthia We: It was beautiful. Beautifully done and and the story was heartbreaking.

399
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:29.160
Cynthia We: It was like one of the things she said in it. I still remember why is it. I always look for love through male violence or something like that, like,

400
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:38.100
Cynthia We: About why she had married. These guys because, oh, because it opens on on her husband, her second husband pointing a gun at her.

401
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.040
Cynthia We: One night, um,

402
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:48.240
Cynthia We: And that's just kind of deflated me and I feel like

403
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.910
Cynthia We: I've got nothing. I'm okay look

404
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You compared, didn't you, you, you.

405
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.180
Cynthia We: Did yeah

406
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.260
Cynthia We: I know better or data is not Lydia.

407
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just write this. This is the phrase comparison kills creativity.

408
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it kills it instantly Cynthia when you start dipping into it.

409
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.750
Cynthia We: Why, yeah.

410
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It does it instantly memorize that plug it in. Enjoy other's talents.

411
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. That's not what

412
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.170
Cynthia We: Sorry, sorry, didn't mean to drop you.

413
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.620
Cynthia We: Know I'm just picking up my piece of paper. So I can write it down.

414
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.530
Okay.

415
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.440
Cynthia We: I know this.

416
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:49.380
Cynthia We: I know this and I'm usually pretty good about not comparing myself to other writers, because I'm different.

417
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:54.030
Cynthia We: I'm just different a different style so greater

418
00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a couple minutes here. Now you know you're a different style writer.

419
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.640
Cynthia We: Doesn't matter. You guys still want to compare because that's what we do.

420
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: deflated.

421
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.720
Yeah.

422
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not even Titian let that soak in. You're not in competition.

423
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Her light does not diminish yours.

424
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, your life when you are better a better writer and you see someone that is struggling to get to where you are. Your light does not diminish. There's

425
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You just get through.

426
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you get to shine.

427
00:38:44.640 --> 00:39:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And look instead turn at turn on the curiosity and investigate how did she structure that sentence that I just it flowed so smoothly and investigate inquire us curiosity lean in understand how, what was it about that. It was so smooth.

428
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what is it you see how I'm learning versus

429
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're like, I'll never be that good. Look what I go nowhere with that I instead if I go

430
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

431
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If I did that.

432
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If I could not lean and stand on the shoulders of these theorists, I would have nothing.

433
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I would only have this silly stuff I got in high school, right, and everything was right and wrong.

434
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, bad, you're not being a good girl. And yes, it would be worthless. I feel terrible therapist but I listened to theory and I got lots of training and I continue to learn. And when I see other people have really cool to me. I don't get jealous for long.

435
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A year that they have and expand it, make it my own

436
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.490
Cynthia We: Yeah.

437
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.210
Cynthia We: I think that um

438
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:25.230
Cynthia We: I think that what's different about her essay. What really really grabbed me is that there's the emotional component to it. And mine is more telling and talking at versus that emotional. It's just like advertising like advertising on the works if there's an emotional

439
00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.200
Cynthia We: If you make people feel something.

440
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:39.870
Cynthia We: And the way she told that story like made me feel in my, you know, all in myself like gave me chills.

441
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.130
Cynthia We: Yeah, so

442
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.830
Cynthia We: That's what I can take from that and

443
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.990
Cynthia We: It's really

444
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:56.100
Cynthia We: Well done, and how God told me how to do it, you know, physically do it, cut it out and place it around so I don't have to think like that.

445
00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to know. You want to know a step, you could take. We've only got a second here.

446
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.260
Cynthia We: Yeah.

447
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What we just talked about going with that. Remembering that it will kill it. So it's your choice like that spirit to die immediately when you compare or you do right you got that one. And then if you really want to go next level you reach out to that author and you give her a compliment.

448
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.470
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

449
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.140
Cynthia We: So that's a bad rocked my

450
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: World, man. I felt from my server. I felt it in my core this this phrase you did it just, it brought me to BAM like immediately.

451
00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Air

452
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.750
Cynthia We: I actually did that recently I wrote to it, author and give him a

453
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:43.950
Scarcity

454
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You

455
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.000
Cynthia We: Give it to her.

456
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And now all of a sudden yours as well. It's just this magical thing that happens, but you get small little squirrel. Like there's only a little bit of

457
00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:58.740
Cynthia We: Town.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.280
Cynthia We: No, they

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.990
Cynthia We: Said the heart and

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, give it a go teach someone how to do what she did go ask her how that so

463
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I would go give it away. I'm telling you, it will come back.

464
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.560
Cynthia We: Oh yes, that's a great idea. I love that.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.500
Cynthia We: I'm going to take a

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.300
