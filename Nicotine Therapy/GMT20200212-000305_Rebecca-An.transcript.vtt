7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay. Um, first question on the bike is wanting to know why you are seeking treatment now.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.600
ethant: Um,

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:53.640
ethant: It's interesting to our day an answer that concisely, um, I have like usage patterns in my life that are seriously damaging the things that I value in my life. So I want to, I want to save my family and my

10
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.160
You know, going to stop these this destructive pattern.

11
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and

12
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you tell me about your using history. We're at what age did you first start, what was the first substance you were exposed to and used and how did it progressed from there.

13
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.190
ethant: Sure. I mean, as a

14
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:35.850
ethant: Like when I was a young teenager, I probably tried marijuana when I was like 12 or 13 and then a lot of alcohol when I was a teenager MDMA. When I was a teenager progress to like cocaine in my late teens and then alcohol and

15
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:49.980
ethant: So I was a full blown I'm sort of heavy user. But by the time I was, you know, 1718

16
00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:05.430
ethant: And then I had a long periods of recovery in my life. SO I'VE BEEN SOBER several, several times for like five, five years at one time for five years and one time for more than 10 years

17
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what at what point was it worse. The worst for you.

18
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.230
ethant: It seems like it can always get worse. But, um, this

19
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.660
ethant: Last week I was

20
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.210
ethant: So I odd and I would have died if my wife hadn't found me and take me to the hospital.

21
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what it, what is your primary drug that you use.

22
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.250
ethant: Definitely like one of those drugs cocktail kind of people, but I'm recently it's been opiates and

23
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.460
Mixing opiates and stimulants.

24
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So methamphetamines and just opiates or heroin.

25
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.480
ethant: Not probably oxy oxy cotton. If you want to be specific, primarily, but also like

26
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.360
ethant: Other opiate

27
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.640

28
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay guy. Yeah, okay. I was wondering, Was this

29
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Specific but I get it. Um, okay. So any history of

30
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My gosh, I can't even the treatment.

31
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.570
ethant: Yeah, I've definitely done different treatments before

ethant: I've done 28 day programs, a couple times a couple times when I've stayed the whole time. A couple times when I've gone and then bailed out

34
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.300
ethant: So yeah, and then I have

35
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.470
ethant: A long sort of history in relationship with AJ Francisco and recently.

36
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.180
ethant: I can't

37
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.740

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:22.050
ethant: Mean, my parents stayed together, despite not having like a real sexual relationship for the you know the house household and in the kids in the family. So it actually felt like a very stable family.

74
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so it's just you and your sister. Yeah.

75

82
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.090
ethant: So yeah, I was a

83
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:40.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trial lesson you were troubled. Was it because of your drinking and using during school or was it was there other things that were going on.

84
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.470
ethant: Impact also

85
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:55.170

ethant: Um, so I can't fall asleep at night and I can't wake up in the morning, like there's no fourth never been added to this day, like I have to find jobs where it's not not not that big a deal if I'm like, oh, you know, if I sleep through an alarm once in a while.

87
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.440

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any legal history.

89
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.420

90
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.210
ethant: My wife and I had a terrible incident which was like we're both drunk. And so we started sort of

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:44.460
ethant: Wrestling with each other, you know, we weren't like throwing or I wasn't dropping like

92
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:55.680

100
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and any financial stressors for you right now.

101
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.510
ethant: Yeah, I think, um, there's never enough like

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:45.600
ethant: My wife and I want to have a household, you know, love to have a small family and live in San Francisco where where the rest of my family is but

103
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:56.100
ethant: It's like I have almost a million dollars in the bank, and we still can't quite figure out how to I know I have like half a million dollars in the bank, but I can't. It's not like not enough to buy a house. It's crazy.

104
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.240
Yeah.

105
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, while you're. Is there anything else that it's that's important for us to know about you.

106
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:06.660
Know,

107
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm okay so here's something to think about what, what are you wanting to get out of treatment why you're here working with us up right heart.

108
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.670
ethant: Um,

109
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.730
ethant: I go, I want to, I need that transformation from like

110
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.740
ethant: I've gone through it so many times. It's like just insanity where I can't make the right decision to like health where I'm

111
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.710
ethant: I have balance in my life and

112
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.370
ethant: I'm making right choices.

113
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.030
You know,

114
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you currently engaged in the math program.

115
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.100
ethant: I don't even know what that is.

116
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm Matt. Matt program is

117
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:10.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your evaluated by one of our doctors to see if you're a candidate for it, but the map program is therapy and group with medication assisted treatment.

118
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:18.450
ethant: I'm know that kind of sounds like what I thought I was

119
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.670
ethant: You can be getting

120
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.490
ethant: Done, but

121
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.190
ethant: So I've done so far as one half an hour intake.

122
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, you're in the very beginning. Yeah, okay.

123
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.210
ethant: Um,

124
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:45.540
ethant: And then, I guess, I guess I do another second half an hour and then we're expecting the intake period will be over. And I'll start doing a group thing from my understanding.

125
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, so, do you know what doctor you're working with.

126
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.920
ethant: Mary Kastner

127
00:12:53.190 --> 00:13:02.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah okay I work with her love her. Um, okay. So, generally the way that medication assisted treatment goes is that

128
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:18.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll meet with with Mary she'll to HMP with you, health and physical with you and you'll engage in in group therapy which with Mary, we do group her and I do group.

129
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mondays at four.

130
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are the days that that our

131
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:33.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alcohol and Drug Matt program you know group is you and I will do therapy together.

132
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:40.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On a weekly basis and really kind of identify and work through the issues.

133
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That keep you in this cycle.

134
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you're struggling with things, then I can help you. I can help help you learn tools to be able to react and respond to things differently than what you're used to doing.

135
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's generally how it works. And I'm glad that they got you in for your bps your bio psychosocial first because that's how we get to know you. Right. Yeah.

136
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:16.440
ethant: It was funny because. So the reason I got this appointment was yesterday. Daniel was like, did they set you up with the bio cycles you know yet.

137
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:28.110
ethant: And I'm like, no, I hadn't heard anything about it. So it sounds like there's several different tracks that you can get on within bright heart.

138
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:36.240
ethant: And yes. Um, so yeah, this sounds like one that is appropriate appropriate for me. Do you mind if I vaporize well

139
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:44.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, while you're in group. You can't I just want to give you that P that heads up right now but um okay so generally

140
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:54.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What, what we do is, you have an individual weekly have a group weekly so you'll be seeing us twice a week. Mary will

141
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: will prescribe the medication to get you through to for on a weekly basis for a little bit until you're at the right dosage and you're

142
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you're stable and steady within the program and it's heavy for you've heard of Suboxone buprenorphine okay because that's what it is. It's

143
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's, it's a good program you, the people that you meet in our group, you'll see how it's really helped them.

162
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:50.220

00:17:51.660 --> 00:18:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Emotion regulation, whether it, whether it be cognitive changing your thought process, whether it be developing a relapse prevention plan, whether it be grief and loss, whether things internally that you and I can work on in our individual sessions.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, okay, and between now and next time you and I meet

165
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:26.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then we'll be able to devise that treatment plan and what the goals will be. And you know what, I need to bring to the table to help you succeed in that area.

166
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.420
ethant: Yep. Okay.

167
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, does that make that sound like a plan. Yeah. So look. Okay, so next week.

168
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Next Wednesday is the 19th

169
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. So at night at 6pm yeah

170
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I am going to put you on my schedule for individual

171
00:18:55.230 --> 00:19:01.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Therapy and and I'm also going to find out what do you know when you have an appointment with Mary

172
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:13.620
ethant: The first one was 10am on the Monday this week. The next one is like 8am Monday of next week.

173
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you want to make sure that you that you get into that appointment, because that's your health and physical Mary will be your prescriber and she's going to be out of town.

174
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: After next week for about three weeks. So yeah, you want to get going. You want to make sure that you've seen her and you get to get that under your belt. Okay. Yeah, so

175
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.320
ethant: I've definitely um

176
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.090
ethant: We're getting getting started like she's already written some stuff for me.

177
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.570
ethant: But that's interesting. That'll be

178
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.180
ethant: Like covering those

179
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.600
ethant: We I assume it's pretty clear how it's gonna work out but

180
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.210
ethant: Yeah, it was interesting that she's out

181
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, because her and I, this is Mary and I work differently than Mary. What can I do with most doctors, most doctors are generally are in group with us every week, Mary.

182
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:21.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She comes to group once or twice a month and after every group I report to her, who is came what they're struggling with, and whether or not they need their medication refilled.

183
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I give her that information as soon as we get out of group I'm emailing her and letting her know so that she can get everyone's Medications and prescriptions to the pharmacy.

184
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's really worked out. We have a good good strong core

185
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Group that we work with on Mondays. So

186
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.620
ethant: Question.

187
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.220
ethant: I heard there's a seven o'clock group on Mondays as well.

188
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There is a seven o'clock group on Mondays. But the problem is that we're trying to gear. That's for mental health.

189
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we're trying to really get

190
00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, people into the four o'clock for substance abuse and mental health be mental health. However, when you meet with Mary if marriage between you and Mary. If you decide that you're going to go into the seven o'clock. Mary will will tell me

191
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To make sure that you're in that seven o'clock and not

192
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Married she

193
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.340
ethant: Married did not tell me about this.

194
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:25.230
ethant: One of the scheduler people did so. But at the time, would be a little bit better for me. That's why I asked, but four o'clock.

195
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:36.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, four o'clock is for the ad and then seven o'clock is for the mental health. And so we're really trying to keep that seven o'clock group for mental health. Yeah.

196
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the four o'clock for substance abuse going on. And again, the the

197
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:54.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The information that they're provided is a little bit is different, a little bit different. What we work on and what we focus on is different, you know, the four o'clock we really focus on

198
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: substance abuse issues, you know, things that have have really substance abuse is really created

199
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do we get through it. There's a lot of support and you'll see you know there's great people in both groups, but there's the four o'clock group is really geared towards substance abuse. So this is what I recommend talk to Mary Yeah.

200
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely let her know the clinic had informed you have the seven o'clock group, but also let her know that I told you that you should be at four o'clock group. Yeah. And let's just kind of go from there and see

201
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:39.450
ethant: What she said the same thing she she she said I should be in the four o'clock group actually would have would have been there yesterday. If it wasn't for stupid insurance problem.

202
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My understanding,

203
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.370
ethant: You can't do two appointments in the same day with the

204
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:50.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Same either something. Yeah. It's crazy how that works. Um, but that's okay. I wasn't there yesterday, either. So

205
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your next appointment will should be Monday at four o'clock.

206
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:07.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what will be your group, you want to check into the virtual clinic about 1520 minutes before group because there's these questionnaires that you've got to fill you know

207
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fill out and then you'll they'll give you the group ID number. And then you come into group and then you and I will meet Wednesday 6pm on a reoccurring basis and I'll let Mary know that to that we've set up individual therapy and she'll be happy about that. So,

208
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.100
ethant: Cool. Hey, um,

209
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.840
ethant: I think it was Danielle who talked with

210
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.630
ethant: Mary told me, like, we're going to be reviewing your journal or something like that. She wasn't

211
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.980
ethant: She didn't, you know, it was very concise.

212
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:56.580
ethant: Um, so, and then I talked a little bit with Danielle about about it but i. So, I'm a firm. I understand. I'm expected to be journaling like every time I I take any medicine and then how I'm feeling so

213
00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:04.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what one of the things that I kind of go through for Mary and group at the beginning of group when you check in. I'll ask you if you

214
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are out of medication. I'll ask you if you have experienced any cravings. I'll ask you how your anxiety has been how your depression has been on and if you're having it. I want you to really pay attention to what level it is. And I'll ask you on a scale of one to 10. Is it, you know.

215
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:34.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Look, you know, one being none 10 being high and she monitors that any si thoughts. She monitors that

216
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any physical issues are you experiencing any constipation any flu like symptoms. So those are kind of the things that the questions that she's going to be asking and that all ask you

217
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the beginning of every group. So those are the things that you really want to pay attention to a monitor why you're engaged in the program.

218
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:03.360
ethant: So yeah, I haven't doing this journal. Um, I have just been able recently to start eating, but I

219
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.740
ethant: My digestion hasn't really started again. I don't know if you know any tricks.

220
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I say

221
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it depends on what you put in your body. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water.

222
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And make sure that try to eat small meals. Yep. Um, are you struggling with constipation still

223
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.290
ethant: Yeah, it was.

224
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.710
ethant: It's been a major, major issue.

225
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.610
Yeah.

226
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There were three things that somebody told me in another group. Hold on, let me find them that you could eat combined together and eat that would help with that.

227
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:55.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay so apple sauce one cup of applesauce half a cup of green juice.

228
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.690
ethant: Or

229
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.120
ethant: Orange juice.

230
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And oats fiber. Fiber roads. So those three combined together will help

231
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:18.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: hopefully help you become regulated will start clearing your system out and that's a healthy way of doing it. But Mary will also

232
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.800
ethant: Have each of those. Oh, you said

233
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One cup of applesauce, a half a half a cup of orange juice.

234
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then one cup of oak fiber.

235
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:43.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you should, you're going to mix it together and you should only eat like 123 tablespoons of it at a time. It's just a good, but you want to do it like daily for a couple days. And that was from a whole nother doctor that I learned that

236
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mary if if Mary knows that you're struggling with constipation. Still, she will

237
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: give you suggestions, such as mayor relax or

238
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't relax. Sorry, took some relax yesterday, um,

239
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.430
ethant: But this is an interesting

240
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.050
Yeah.

241
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's all natural to you know it's helped me. And so I thought that was pretty interesting. I wrote that little cocktail down, you know,

242
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you can try that, too. And it's, it's good for you out there you know it's not damaging to your system so cool. And then we are your bio psychosocial stun pretty painless. Oh, no.

243
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, sounds

244
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.560
ethant: More complicated than it is.

245
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:43.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really does. I know it's just getting your history, you're using, you know, his history, your family history and really looking at you know you as a whole person.
