12
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.370

13
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.160
Riley Zottola: Doing nothing right

14
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.350
Shawn Phalen: Right feast or famine, huh.

Riley Zottola: Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And so, you know, first time and cod, probably. I can't even tell you how long that

16
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.390
Riley Zottola: I've had more than a couple of hundred dollars in my bank account, you know,

17
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.140
Shawn Phalen: So, are you able to save. Are you happy are you putting away some money.

18
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:53.910
Riley Zottola: Oh yeah, I got a battle stack saved away right now. Alright, so that must make you feel good. Oh yeah, it's not, you know, I spent so many years like

19
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.050
Riley Zottola: Just like scrounging to get by. And now, like I'm at a point where

20
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.710
Riley Zottola: Basically anything could arise, and I will be financially able to handle it.

21
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.220
Riley Zottola: You know, and that's it, that's it. Very COMFORTING FEELING. Yeah, seriously.

22
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.290
Shawn Phalen: Like used to feel really solid in your sobriety.

23
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.550
Riley Zottola: Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we got

24
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:35.370
Riley Zottola: You know, one of my co workers that I've become friends with you know he got about three years he said three, three and a half years.

25
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.340
Riley Zottola: Sobriety also and he is

26
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.080
Riley Zottola: Going to be moving. I think this weekend and

27
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.980
Riley Zottola: I don't know either just the person that he's gonna move in with I've expressed to them, you know,

28
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.310
Riley Zottola: I, I just, I worry about him for that. For that reason, you know, like I just don't want it to burn to get dragged back in and and

29
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.610
Riley Zottola: I don't know that I came to that realization that wow I'm actually

30
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.380
Riley Zottola: really comfortable. Like, I feel really strong in my sobriety enough so that I can be like hey dude like I'm gonna go will jump all in your ass. If you, if I see you slip in at all like

31
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:41.100
Riley Zottola: Because you know i i see now especially like I seen what I have to lose. Yeah, you know, and he's got, you know, he's got kids to I don't have it right, there's so much more. And, and, you know, basically. Long story short, he has. I feel really strong in my sobriety.

32
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.740
Shawn Phalen: So you know what happens typically what happens is that

33
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.950
Shawn Phalen: With each relapse.

34
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.650
Shawn Phalen: It gets harder and harder to come back. Yeah.

35
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.010
Riley Zottola: Yeah, I know. I mean, I know that I did.

36
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:10.920
Riley Zottola: I must have tried to to get clean a dozen times and I get, you know, you mean just a few weeks, or I get two months. You know, I had one string that was

37
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:24.360
Riley Zottola: Eight months and I relapsed. That was the last one I was 18 I had eight months and then I relapsed for two and like halfway through that second month. I was like,

38
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:38.400
Riley Zottola: You know, I know where this is going. Like, I have to get out. Now I have to stop and I got to do something different because I'm gonna die. Otherwise now 19 months ago. Yeah, right. So, I mean I lucked out with that with that short

39
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.640
Riley Zottola: Short relapse, because you know

40
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.190
Riley Zottola: The times before, like I said, I get a couple of months, or I get a couple of weeks and then I'd be off and running for a couple years.

41
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.630
Riley Zottola: You know,

42
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.320
Shawn Phalen: So,

43
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.960
You find yourself like completely

44
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:11.910
Shawn Phalen: I mean, I imagine you don't have any contact with anybody that from your past that you used to use correct

45
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.610
Riley Zottola: No, I don't know. Anyway, I moved. I moved

46
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.550
Riley Zottola: Down in LA and I moved up to Crescent City to get away from all that and I you know I changed my phone number.

47
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.300
Riley Zottola: I basically started from, from scratch. And then now you know I'm down here in the Sacramento area. But even when I went down to LA.

48
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.180
Riley Zottola: For Christmas I went out there to go to my sister's house.

49
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:51.210
Riley Zottola: I didn't, you know, go back to because I could have easily just jumped on the freeway and been back in that same shuttle in like 35 minutes and I

50
00:06:51.930 --> 00:07:02.760
Riley Zottola: You know I stayed clear there stayed with family. Yeah, I know, desire, like even just go back to the town. I didn't care. He was in that town is just successfully.

51
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.290
Shawn Phalen: So do you have. Do you have friends that you hang out with like clean sober friends or do you just kind of stay to yourself.

52
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.390
Riley Zottola: Right now I just kind of stay to myself. I mean, I do have, I do have friends.

53
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:30.810
Riley Zottola: That I've made here at the at work, you know, people that I get along with really well that I would definitely hang out with outside of work.

54
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:41.670
Riley Zottola: But just right now. I'm not really concerned with that because I'm more interested in

55
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.760
Riley Zottola: Like setting a stronger foundation, especially in terms of finance.

56
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.960
Riley Zottola: You know,

57
00:07:49.290 --> 00:08:00.210
Riley Zottola: I'd rather put more money away not go out and spend it, you know, hanging out with people and whatnot, doing whatever so that because right now. I still stay with my dad.

58
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:17.760
Riley Zottola: My dad for the past few months, and you know, I'd like to get my own place right you know so I I'm focusing more on that. I mean, yeah, I mean going out, you know, here and there and hang out with these guys. Yeah, that's

59
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:25.350
Riley Zottola: I'm sure that that will occur. Soon, but these past three months. It is really hasn't it

60
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.140
Riley Zottola: I just haven't cared to

61
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:47.280
Riley Zottola: Be outside socializing. But I mean, when we're at work. It's like, it's basically like we're hanging out all day anyway, right, because it's not like we're just, you know, busy, busy, busy just, you know, working it's were joking around having a good time while we're doing, you know, right.

62
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.500
Shawn Phalen: Did you have a timeframe on when you want to move out of your dad's place.

63
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.950
Riley Zottola: Yeah, I'd like to, I'd like to

64
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:07.650
Riley Zottola: Right around the beginning of the summer and my reason for that is wanted to help me put more money away between now and then.

65
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:30.060
Riley Zottola: We're in the winter months. So if weather turns, then we don't work summer guaranteed minimum 40 hours a week, you know, so if that's if I don't want to get myself into a spot where I go. And, you know, put down

66
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:41.730
Riley Zottola: What is it like first and last month's rent on a place or something like that and then kind of be another you know you know give up all that money and then not be able to go back to work to make it back.

67
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:55.440
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and and i think like I'm you know at this stage at where you are. I mean, I think it's fine. You know, you just do what you do to all of that will happen when

68
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:05.820
Shawn Phalen: You're ready for that to happen. So I'm that's just why I was just curious, you know, just asking about that. I mean, and you know there's certainly

69
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:22.590
Shawn Phalen: No rush, your dad probably loves having you there and you know it's afford you the opportunity to put money away and, like I've said before, you know, you're super fortunate because you have a really close tight knit family. So you've got that support system.

70
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.350
Riley Zottola: Yeah, you know, take advantage of it.

71
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.530
And, you know, just

72
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.600
You know,

73
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.460
Shawn Phalen: Keep doing what you're doing, you know, just keep on that path and

74
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:46.470
Riley Zottola: You know, just keep working. And yeah, you know, doing the Suboxone doing the groups and all that kind of stuff. And so

75
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.160
Shawn Phalen: I mean everything's falling into place for you really, really well. So

76
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.880
Yeah.

77
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.780
Riley Zottola: I was trying to tell that to one of the one of the people that was in my group.

78
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:12.330
Riley Zottola: The other night, you know, cuz she was saying that she was struggling and I had to explain to her, you know, like this step, like when you start taking your, you know, Suboxone like it's not an automatic thing. It's not like

79
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:23.520
Riley Zottola: One day you stopped doing dope and the next day you start taking Suboxone and you're fine. Like there's a there's a period of adjustment and it's, you have to fight through it because it's going to be uncomfortable, even though

80
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:31.170
Riley Zottola: You've got the meds. You've got to be uncomfortable, but if you fight through it, you'd be crazy surprised at all the possibilities that open up for you right

81
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.330
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, it's so true. You know, and it's like you got to put the work into, you know,

82
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:51.120
Riley Zottola: Take action and everything goes back to how it was before he started using or yeah I mean it took me 16 months 16 months on Suboxone before I got my feet set. Yeah, and

83
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.340
Riley Zottola: You know, I mean, that's

84
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:04.140
Shawn Phalen: That's about what it takes, you know, so yeah you got to put the work in you got it in your right you guys just dig in and get through that really uncomfortable.

85
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:18.000
Riley Zottola: It's like a uncomfortable like six months, like the dead body adjustment is only a couple of weeks, but the emotional shit that goes on at last four months. Yeah, that's it's gnarly.

86
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:36.540
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, because you're feeling stuff that you hadn't felt for so long. You know, because you're not numbing your numbing your body not numbing so you got to sit with those feelings you know they're almost foreign like you just like after using you forget

87
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.540
Shawn Phalen: You know what it's like to have

88
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:47.640
Shawn Phalen: Emotions and start feeling again and I'm that's

89
00:12:48.120 --> 00:13:03.840
Shawn Phalen: Like I hear that all the time. All the time. So, and you're right, it takes about a minimum of six months, sometimes it takes people up to a year, but it's like if you can get past that if you can get past that year mark and you keep doing the work.

90
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.560
Yeah.

91
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.600
Riley Zottola: Yeah I agree wholeheartedly with that. Yeah, I've seen it.

92
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.220
Shawn Phalen: Well, yeah.

93
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.150
Shawn Phalen: They live in it.

94
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.970
Shawn Phalen: Okay. So anything else that anything you wanted to go over

95
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.370
Riley Zottola: No.

96
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.650
Riley Zottola: I don't think so.

97
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.330
