00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.220
Hannah Gunter: The buyer modeling 9am not on anything.

159
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.580
Richelle Direny: And you haven't seen a psychiatrist in a while, right.

160
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.320
Hannah Gunter: No, I haven't seen one at all.

161
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:03.210
Richelle Direny: Now when you say that she did, she she who Dr. Jamison

162
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:15.450
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, I mean, I don't think, I don't know. I can never talk to her privately, you know, it's always in group and I know I'm not comfortable doing that.

163
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.720
Richelle Direny: And this is

164
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.870
Richelle Direny: You want to speak to her specifically

165
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.960
Richelle Direny: About the fact that you've had the increased anxiety.

166
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:38.370
Hannah Gunter: I would like to. I mean, I would love to see a psychiatrist. Also, but I don't nobody. I mean, nobody has mentioned, I don't know which way to go about it.

167
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.920
Richelle Direny: I mean, you would have to the way you would go is call your insurance company because they will tell you who

168
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.740
Richelle Direny: Accepts your area that accepts your insurance.

169
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.270
Richelle Direny: That

170
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.550
Richelle Direny: Everything is Tele health, it's

171
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:59.730
Richelle Direny: Probably be a little bit more convenient for you to get in contact with a psychiatrist and meet him via this way through telemedicine.

172
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.770
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, so I can do it like I do with you guys like

173
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.830
Richelle Direny: Now that now with air in light of everything going on.

174
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:14.460
Richelle Direny: I think that, you know, maybe more doctors are more open to doing the telemedicine.

175
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.890
Richelle Direny: So,

176
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:25.200
Richelle Direny: But either way, like I said, the first start is that you have to call your insurance company, you'd have to call your insurance company to see who, and that is something that you would have to

177
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.210
Richelle Direny: Do with your insurance company to see who, um, what do you have Medicaid

178
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.190
Hannah Gunter: Yeah Molina

179
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:42.360
Richelle Direny: Now that that the only challenge with that because I've had other patients who has Medicaid and depending on the care plan that they have

180
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:48.600
Richelle Direny: You know it's sometimes to get your first appointment. You're waiting a long time.

181
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.030
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, that's what I've experienced

182
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.730
Hannah Gunter: So what do I do about that.

183
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.620
Richelle Direny: You just call just make an appointment. Just call and find someone who accepts Molina

184
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.490
Richelle Direny: Scheduled the appointment and even if the appointment is three or four months out

185
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.980
Richelle Direny: Sometimes they put you on a waitlist that if

186
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.800
Richelle Direny: They have something that comes up sooner they caught, they, they start calling people on that weightless.

187
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.060
Hannah Gunter: Okay.

188
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:12.870
Hannah Gunter: So, but

189
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:23.370
Richelle Direny: You have to start there is calling on the insurance company to try to get an appointment, because even with bipolar disorder. I know depending on the medication that they put you on

190
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:30.090
Richelle Direny: They often do blood work every so often to see the levels in your system.

191
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:30.930
Hannah Gunter: Depending

192
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.440
Richelle Direny: On the medication, they are giving you and how it's being treated

193
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:52.440
Richelle Direny: But, you know, you can also speak with. I know that since we haven't spoken in in a while. I know part of it with. And now, and by no means am I suggesting, or saying that the reason why I don't know what the issue is for you with Dr. Jamison

194
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.930
Hannah Gunter: But all what it is either. I don't know.

195
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.140
Richelle Direny: But

196
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.730
Richelle Direny: I could tell her that I did.

197
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.850
Richelle Direny: Meet with you because I do know that she really truly encourages

198
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:19.170
Richelle Direny: I'm meeting with at least doing one session or however it's scheduled. I'm sure really and truly she truly encourages that she also looks at the consistency with either attendance or miss. Not just groups but sessions individual sessions.

199
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:33.150
Richelle Direny: So once I let her know, You know, I'm in terms, I know where and when it comes on to the script that's one thing but again for anything else in terms of the increased anxiety or anything else, you know,

200
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.400
Hannah Gunter: I don't know, and help me with that.

201
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:53.970
Richelle Direny: I sent her an email expressing how you feel and see is a way to get an ending medication, an appointment with her, but you can discuss because, I mean, the other one was time you've been to a doctor, your regular medical doctor

202
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.050
Hannah Gunter: I haven't seen my pa for a while.

203
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.940
Richelle Direny: What is a while.

204
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.120
Hannah Gunter: Probably a couple months.

205
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.920
Richelle Direny: Okay, if you're feeling that there is a change within your body. I think no off because to say

206
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.500
Richelle Direny: It could be stressed and do it's

207
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.890
Richelle Direny: Because of your brother or, you know, the marital issues that you're having you

208
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.670
Richelle Direny: Know thing but

209
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.920
Richelle Direny: I mean, I

210
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.180
Richelle Direny: Before kind of

211
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:37.350
Richelle Direny: traveling down that road. You always want to emulate innate if there's any underlining medical things that's going on or if there's changes where thats related because if you're saying that your issues or could it be that your marital is related to your increase things it

212
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.870
Hannah Gunter: Probably

213
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.700
Richelle Direny: So if you if you're if

214
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.700
Hannah Gunter: You're cutting out, Rochelle.

215
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.630
Richelle Direny: Hmm, I'm still now.

216
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.940
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, you're cutting out really bad.

217
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.570
Richelle Direny: Okay, I don't know, do anything.

218
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.780
Hannah Gunter: I can't hear you.

219
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.030
Um,

220
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.730
Richelle Direny: Hold on, hold on one second. Okay, one second.

221
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.650
Hannah Gunter: Hold one

222
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.400
Hannah Gunter: Oh, perfect.

223
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.750
Hannah Gunter: She froze.

224
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.210
Hannah Gunter: I don't know, I can't. I heard you say, I don't know.

225
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.740
Richelle Direny: Am I, am I still cutting up really bad.

226
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.610
Hannah Gunter: No you're not. Now you're you're okay for the time being.

227
00:20:51.600 --> 00:21:02.070
Richelle Direny: Let me tell you, I think this is the other thing, and then we're gonna get back to talking about like trying to assess what's going on. And I think when it comes on to the internet in law. This

228
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:12.690
Richelle Direny: Pandemic that's going on a lot more people that's working from home or just going internet based or, you know, Wi Fi and they're using AI system.

229
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:26.610
Richelle Direny: So you'll find that there's going to be a lot of issues. And that's just coming from. I would just think like the the internet provider themselves because it's like an overload that's going on on the system, you're talking about

230
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.490
Hannah Gunter: Everyone using everyone

231
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.300
Richelle Direny: You know, that's the only way you can communicate with anybody, these days.

232
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.080
Soon and Very

233
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.530
Richelle Direny: Soon, very soon they're going to start telling you you and your spouse needs to be in two different rooms talking on the

234
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.890
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, talking on the phone to one another.

235
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.150
Hannah Gunter: And the next dream right beside me, like, four feet away.

236
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.380
Richelle Direny: So 60 and social distance and he has to be in the

237
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.820
Hannah Gunter: social distancing

238
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.870
Hannah Gunter: Everything is a computer nowadays so

239
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.390
Hannah Gunter: Oh yes for too long. I'll have to be in one room and he'll be in the other one.

240
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:04.830
Richelle Direny: That's

241
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:10.260
Richelle Direny: That's another thing. It said the, I think the Wi Fi system. It's just unstable right now because I

242
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:10.470
Have

243
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.010
Hannah Gunter: So many people is using the internet right now.

244
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.290
Richelle Direny: You're talking about like at home if two parents are working from home and the children are now.

245
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:19.560
Hannah Gunter: Going

246
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.790
Richelle Direny: To school online. You see, like, that's just a lot of people just

247
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.570
On those

248
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.590
Hannah Gunter: So that's like 7 billion people probably

249
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.780
Richelle Direny: There you go. That's all.

250
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:47.790
Richelle Direny: So, but, in any case, I mean when it comes on to your medical provider maybe checking in just the kind of speed, they need to do any blood work and just see if there's anything going on where that's concerned because that could be another factor.

251
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.850
Hannah Gunter: Okay, how, how, though, how would that be a factor because

252
00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:00.930
Richelle Direny: Okay, let's say if you go to your doctor and you're just saying, hey, you know what I really don't know. I've just been feeling very anxious

253
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:14.550
Richelle Direny: You know, you're just describing how you have been feeling they ask you a series of questions and if they feel that based on what you're saying that they're going to run bloodwork to see whether it's your thyroid, or whatever it is.

254
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:27.270
Richelle Direny: Just to see if everything's normal it from a medical standpoint, everything is fine then. Now we're talking about, okay, what other things are going on. Has there been any changes. Did you have any recent

255
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:40.320
Richelle Direny: Loss. I know you said one of the issues is with your brother, but that's over a month. Now the question is, how have you how you've been feeling with the increased anxiety. Was that before or after your brother got hospitalized.

256
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.560
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, it was after probably

257
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.910
Richelle Direny: OK. So now, how close are you to your brother.

258
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:57.090
Hannah Gunter: My brother and I are very close, but I've always, you know, had anxiety but and I don't know. It's like, I don't know. I

259
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.480
Hannah Gunter: I feel like I'm about to jump out of my skin.

260
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.100
Hannah Gunter: Mm hmm.

261
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:15.870
Richelle Direny: But then the your, your increase fatigue. That's what I mean. That's one of the things that you're called that fatigue. So the increased fatigue. What is that all associated with your brother being in the hospital, like what is the prognosis.

262
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.430
Hannah Gunter: I mean,

263
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.270
Hannah Gunter: No, not all of it. Okay.

264
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.650
Richelle Direny: So what else do you think is going on that you, what did you experience that made you started feeling like that.

265
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.170
Hannah Gunter: Um, I don't know, like

266
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.860
Hannah Gunter: Maybe my personal life.

267
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.800
Hannah Gunter: Okay, now

268
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.050
Richelle Direny: Outside. Now what is within your person that

269
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.420
Richelle Direny: Like, my life is with your, your marriage.

270
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.770
Hannah Gunter: Was specifically

271
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.490
Richelle Direny: About your marriage because your, your husband is in law school, isn't he

272
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.040
Hannah Gunter: Yes. Yes, he is.

273
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.500
Hannah Gunter: He's very smart.

274
00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:03.240
Hannah Gunter: Um, I don't know. We just don't know. I don't I don't I don't really want to talk about that. I mean, I don't know, we've just been arguing

275
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.820
Hannah Gunter: A little more

276
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.250
Hannah Gunter: And it worries me.

277
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.670
Richelle Direny: You know, is it the argument is feels like you feel like your marriage is falling apart.

278
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.480
Yeah.

279
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.990
Richelle Direny: Now it depends on the content of your arguments and what triggers your arguments, because, I mean,

280
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.750
Richelle Direny: There is also the fact that i mean

281
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.700
I think

282
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:45.870
Richelle Direny: Depending on the argument of what triggers it. I mean, it's arguments in relationship is what helps the strengthen the relationship because then you learn how to identify talk through it and then you know get through it.

283
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.270
Hannah Gunter: I like that.

284
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.130
Hannah Gunter: It's just, I don't know.

285
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.670
Hannah Gunter: And Brandon just lost his mom.

286
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.090
Hannah Gunter: And that's been really hard.

287
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:02.250
Mm hmm.

288
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:18.090
Richelle Direny: Yes, I know. So, and do you think all of your fatigue and anxiety and all of that is kind of escalating or it increases at from the loss of your mother in law, your brother being hospitalized.

289
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.760
Hannah Gunter: Yet just life in general.

290
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.270
Hannah Gunter: Just

291
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.230
Hannah Gunter: It's hard to talk about. I don't

292
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.300
Richelle Direny: Well, while ignoring it doesn't make it go away.

293
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.140
Hannah Gunter: It just

294
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.550
For that second

295
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.440
Hannah Gunter: Now,

296
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.140
Richelle Direny: But really just stops it for that second

297
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.790
Richelle Direny: One of the things

298
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.440
Hannah Gunter: I said, I'm trying to plug my phone in

299
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.580
Richelle Direny: No, that's fine. One of the things that I do know.

300
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.740
Richelle Direny: That I'm

301
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:10.050
Richelle Direny: That do you or would you agree because one of the things I observed about you. You harbor things a lot

302
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.290
Hannah Gunter: You keep everything in. I do keep everything

303
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.360
Richelle Direny: That's not good. Because every time that we touch on something you always say, I don't want to talk about it. I don't want

304
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.060
Hannah Gunter: I don't know how to talk about it.

305
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.130
Richelle Direny: Do you fear the emotion, the overwhelming emotion that's going to come after

306
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.360
Hannah Gunter: Yes, yes.

307
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:38.850
Richelle Direny: But then that's the only way you can. It's like a when a horn is healing. It's sometimes it gets very painful during the healing process. But that's just part of the healing process.

308
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.490
Hannah Gunter: It's hard.

309
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:54.360
Richelle Direny: It is hard. Think about it. So I have this metaphor. Think about you have. I know you have children, it's thinking about the baby needs to come out.

310
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.390
Richelle Direny: Are you going to feel good. During that process.

311
00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.430
Hannah Gunter: Of the baby coming up.

312
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.000
Hannah Gunter: Whoa.

313
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:00.900
And when

314
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.780
Richelle Direny: It when they're telling you breathe, breathe, breathe, and you're saying, No, I don't want to breathe it hurts. No, no.

315
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:14.310
Richelle Direny: Why the hey the but what comes out at the end of all of that pain and suffering. You went

316
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.600
Hannah Gunter: Into beautiful. Yeah.

317
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.470
Richelle Direny: There you go.

318
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.110
Richelle Direny: So, you know, it's

319
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.310
Richelle Direny: It.

320
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.900
Hannah Gunter: takes people to our it does take people to argue both in relationship to learn when they're not there. Exactly.

321
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.120
Hannah Gunter: Because then you're going to talk about

322
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.600
Richelle Direny: It, you're going to process it, but you have to, you know, it's okay, it's okay.

323
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.890
Richelle Direny: Because sometimes it's all about misunderstanding.

324
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.690
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, that's exactly what it is. This I personally think

325
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.910
Hannah Gunter: That I get mad at one another.

326
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.930
Hannah Gunter: It's just hard.

327
00:28:52.860 --> 00:29:00.300
Richelle Direny: But, but the question is, and being honest with yourself to you do the same thing in an argument. Do you stop and say, I don't want to talk about it.

328
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.840
Hannah Gunter: Again, I'm sorry.

329
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.430
Hannah Gunter: I said, I said.

330
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.620
Hannah Gunter: The same thing. I'm saying

331
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.200
Richelle Direny: You know, do you say I don't want to talk about it.

332
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.610
Richelle Direny: In the middle of my argument. Do you should do you

333
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.710
Richelle Direny: Shut down and say, I don't want to talk about it anymore.

334
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:20.880
I do

335
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.150
I do

336
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.610
I just want to shut it off.

337
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.790
Richelle Direny: And what ends up happening at the end.

338
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.140
Richelle Direny: Is that is that is that him sitting right next to you. Yeah.

339
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:51.030
Yeah.

340
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.170
Richelle Direny: I'm

341
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.590
Richelle Direny: No, no, it's not freezing up. Can you hear me.

342
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.840
Hannah Gunter: I can hear you now. Yeah.

343
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.910
Richelle Direny: It's not freezing up ask him if nine o'clock tomorrow is good.

344
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.200
Richelle Direny: Oh, no, no, take that back tomorrow is group, forget it. Don't, don't worry about it. What about

345
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.100
Richelle Direny: What about Wednesday.

346
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.160
Yes.

347
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.080
Yeah, that's fine.

348
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.310
Richelle Direny: No.

349
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.520
Richelle Direny: Is he going to remember

350
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.340
Hannah Gunter: Yes, I won't. He won't remember

351
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.830
Hannah Gunter: He will be there.

352
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:11.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'll put up, put it on my calendar for for nine o'clock on Wednesday morning

353
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.530
Okay.

354
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.120
Richelle Direny: What time do you go, what time do you guys go to group.

355
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.060
Hannah Gunter: I've got a grub at 1030 and

356
00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.120
Hannah Gunter: 430 well

357
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.090
Richelle Direny: And you both go weekly well

358
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:45.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what, one of the things that I would like you to work on Hannah and I think that would there. In the past we've discussed that I really am going to encourage that you call the insurance company to find to see what psychiatry accepts Molina

359
00:33:52.200 --> 00:34:00.690
Richelle Direny: And now, you said that you in terms of like for medical you said it's been just a few months, right.

360
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.510
Medical like

361
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.610
Richelle Direny: Meaning that just go to get your checkup like annual or what have you.

362
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.870
Richelle Direny: You said yes.

363
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.690
Hannah Gunter: It's been a couple of months.

364
00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.050
Richelle Direny: Okay, but I mean, but you're you're

365
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.370
Richelle Direny: You're so you're you're up to date with your annual and all of that.

366
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.280
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

367
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:43.140
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um, I guess I'm just doing that. I'll send a message to Dr. Jamison

368
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:54.000
Richelle Direny: That you would like to schedule an individual appointment with her, or because I know that she has groups, back to back. So sometimes it's a little bit harder. Depending on the size of the group.

369
00:34:54.450 --> 00:35:00.720
Richelle Direny: For her to meet afterwards. So I will just kind of send her, just so you know you could talk to her about

370
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:11.820
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, the fatigue and the anxiety and all of that. But, Hannah. I mean, I know that one of the things that when we spoke in the beginning, I know that you struggle.

371
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:21.990
Richelle Direny: With speaking a lot about your past and just speaking about a lot of what's going on with you. Um, I can't. You're saying I can't hear you, because you're

372
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.990
Richelle Direny: Huh. Oh, oh no, I thought you said something

373
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:42.150
Richelle Direny: Now, okay, yeah. So I know that you you you know you struggle with a lot of things and not necessarily always wanted to speak about the things that are overwhelming for you because it's just emotionally. It's too overwhelming.

374
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.820
Richelle Direny: But, you know, the only way that you can go through any healing process.

375
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.000
Hannah Gunter: I think you froze. I think

376
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.530
Richelle Direny: Am I still frozen.

377
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.510
Hannah Gunter: Okay. Nope. Not anymore.

378
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, when you said I froze you froze.

379
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:28.650
Richelle Direny: So, um, but I definitely encourage for us to make you know for you to try to make your bi weekly appointments

380
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.410
Hannah Gunter: My to my

381
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.240
Richelle Direny: No, no. For here. That was what I think that's what we

382
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:36.810
Hannah Gunter: Are live

383
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:43.260
Hannah Gunter: Oh, with you. Yeah, yeah, okay, I can make a point to do that.

384
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:51.390
Richelle Direny: And just the way that I sent you the message to them about the the the appointment at four, it's in the same way.

385
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:57.600
Richelle Direny: Sometimes it's better if you send me a text. I mean, not to say that I don't check my email.

386
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.590
Richelle Direny: Because I know

387
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:08.790
Richelle Direny: You want. That's the best way that you and Brandon can email you know you send the emails. But I think the Texas. I'm more readily quicker to respond to it.

388
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.200
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, um, I will. Let's see if I can

389
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.070
Richelle Direny: So let's meet

390
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:42.360
Richelle Direny: Let's meet on the is four o'clock. Good for you. Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's meet on the 13th at four okay that is perfect.

391
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.370
Richelle Direny: All right, I'm gonna put you on my calendar. The 13th at four. Okay.

392
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.950
Hannah Gunter: Thank you, Michelle. I will see you then.

393
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.100
Richelle Direny: It, stay safe. Wash your hands wash

394
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.070
Hannah Gunter: Bye bye.

395
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.020
Hannah Gunter: Thank you.

396
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.220
Richelle Direny: No problem. I

397
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.360
Jen: Hi.

398
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.340
Richelle Direny: Hello, how are you

399
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.810
Jen: Good, how are you

400
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.210
Richelle Direny: I'm good, I'm good.

401
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.470
Good.

402
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.640
Richelle Direny: Thank you so much for coming.

403
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:23.100
Richelle Direny: Of course. And so today, our session is more. It's called what is called a bio psychosocial

404
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.660
Richelle Direny: And it's just, it's basically I'm doing history.

405
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.240
Richelle Direny: About, you know,

406
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:38.910
Richelle Direny: Overall addiction and you know you programs that you've been in or what have you, what brought you to our program.

407
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.360
Richelle Direny: Right so so that's pretty much question answer just getting to getting to know you outside of the group, a little bit.

408
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.070
Richelle Direny: And then towards the end, then we'll talk a little bit more about

409
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.950
Richelle Direny: You know what your future would look like in terms of future sessions, how we set that up.

410
00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:05.010
Jen: Okay, I've done, I've done this so many times. So it's easy for me.

411
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.600
Richelle Direny: Well hopefully after this you will kind of get it.

412
00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.520
Richelle Direny: To where I have to keep starting it all over again. Right.

413
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:27.150
Jen: Right, well I mean even going to new doctors and starting new programs on not necessarily relapsing and starting over, like, you know, just like in general, you know,

414
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.570
Richelle Direny: I'm like started going to new doctors or new

415
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.860
Richelle Direny: Programs, maybe your insurance doesn't cover the one you were in before something

416
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.960
Jen: Of that. Right, right.

417
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.940
Richelle Direny: Gotcha, gotcha.

418
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:47.940
Richelle Direny: Gotcha. One moment. So how are you surviving with the stay at home orders.

419
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:54.600
Jen: It doesn't bother me. I'm old owner. I mean, I'm a homebody anyway is so

420
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:06.360
Jen: You know, it's nice to be able to stay home. You know, I've done my partying days. Those days are over. So

421
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:15.900
Jen: It's nice just to relax and not have to worry about hanging out with somebody or, you know,

422
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:25.140
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so there is no real guilt feeling like okay I'm home. I need to get out there and I need to do this, you're

423
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.630
Jen: It. No, no.

424
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.310
Jen: Yeah.

425
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:34.260
Richelle Direny: This is a one time where you can isolate and it's not a problem. It's not something going on.

426
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.810
Richelle Direny: That's created you're worth it.

427
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.730
Jen: Back and

428
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.450
Jen: Re

429
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:54.570
Jen: Stay home. Right. Right. And if I do need to go to the store, then, you know, I'll have my uncle come get me. If he's able to, or if I need to take a walk. I'll walk up to the corner store walk around the block a few times, you know,

430
00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:09.870
Jen: So I got, I got a lot to do in my house. Anyways, because I recently moved in here and I'm still still have boxes to unpack so it's giving me stuff to do.

431
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:20.400
Richelle Direny: Hey, I get that I completely get then on when you move into a new place via the unpacking can be a chore, all within itself.

432
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.180
Jen: Yes. And sometimes it's overwhelming, but

433
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.650
Richelle Direny: I can only imagine.

434
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:34.560
Richelle Direny: Very, very overwhelmed. So you do one box at a time.

435
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:43.350
Jen: Yeah, that's not even my uncle, he said, just do a few boxes, a day, you know, or maybe a little bit of a room in a day.

436
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.240
Jen: That I'm like, No, I just want to get everything done at once.

437
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.670
Richelle Direny: That gets overwhelming and then you do nothing.

438
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.260
Jen: Right, right.

439
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:10.530
Richelle Direny: Alright, so, um, so let's get started. So you're, you're pretty much you're familiar are aware, kind of have the check in process goals that you always check in with the virtual clinic.

440
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:11.220
Jen: Right and

441
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:16.980
Richelle Direny: They will give you the code for you to come in, even if you for individual even if you know the code.

442
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.270
Richelle Direny: They really want you to always check in directly with them first.

443
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:29.100
Richelle Direny: Actually, they just sent him an email because I know that sometimes the way it is a little bit long. But it's always best even if you check in.

444
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:43.860
Richelle Direny: Let's say 30 minutes before and you just leave it there at least you've gotten the cold because then sometimes I'm sitting here wondering what's going on and then you don't come over until like 20 minutes later, because it's like processes so long the

445
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:54.900
Richelle Direny: The other thing is, you know, I always stress the fact that when you come for the especially within group that you're in a place where you know that is pretty private

446
00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:01.950
Richelle Direny: You know you're not just protecting your own confidentiality. I mean, if you're in a room with your family. It's your information, however.

447
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:11.790
Richelle Direny: The other people in a group setting. They may be sharing and, you know, just out of respect and just keeping their information private and confidential. We ask that you keep

448
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.610
Jen: Your earbuds in

449
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.760
Richelle Direny: I know you've been pretty good about it.

450
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:27.060
Richelle Direny: Now, you know, for me, I always just really stress on the fact of if you're on kind of like how I sent you the message.

451
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:35.430
Richelle Direny: It's just sending me a reply, like you did confirming that yes I will be there or no, you know, can we reschedule. I got something going on and I

452
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:51.150
Richelle Direny: You know, I need to reschedule our appointment. That's fine. Let me know. Just adjust all adjust. You know, that's my best source of contact and I noticed that the above message I had sent you prior. You can either send me a text or an email just to, you know,

453
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:56.430
Jen: Yeah, just to get in contact with me, if anything, needs to be changed or you have any questions or

454
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.890
Richelle Direny: You just need that additional support. There's always

455
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:00.000
You can always

456
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:14.850
Richelle Direny: Just I'm just kind of going over you know this is always, you know, our sessions are confidential, for the most part on like with anywhere you go that's dealing with you medically or otherwise.

457
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.770
Richelle Direny: The only people that are privy to what's going on are the people that are working on your team.

458
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:33.030
Richelle Direny: But outside of that, and we are always on a recorded session. So it is a recorded line and so keep in mind as well that I am a mandated reporter. So if you ever state or suggest or say anything that is

459
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:41.970
Richelle Direny: You know, you're making a threat to harm yourself or anyone else or anything of that nature, you know, confidentiality kind of goes out through

460
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:51.120
Richelle Direny: The door like a bright, um, but outside of that, you know, pretty much what is said here stays here.

461
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.740
Alright.

462
00:44:53.850 --> 00:45:05.610
Richelle Direny: Okay. Alright, so let's get started. So this time, our time together. You know, if you have you know 45 minutes to an hour if it's it's less than its last a good 45 minutes or an hour is our time together.

463
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:18.090
Richelle Direny: Especially now with the individuals. Sometimes if it's just like a half an hour checking in, or 45 minutes, you know, that's kind of how we do the individuals, but we'll talk about more the individual and I'll

464
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:35.100
Richelle Direny: Schedule A follow up session after we are time doing this. I'll schedule like a follow up session. And then we kind of go accordingly. Okay. Okay. Now, um, if you could just start telling me what brought you to bright heart health and how did you hear about this program.

465
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:50.940
Jen: Um, my family physician told me about you guys because I had a very, very hectic schedule at the time, and all the places around here that I'm

466
00:45:51.990 --> 00:46:02.100
Jen: Dead because I wanted to get on Suboxone but every place that gave you the Suboxone you had to go to the I O P three times a week, three hours a day.

467
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:17.670
Jen: And random drug task, which is fine, but it would cut in to my time for work, because I don't have a car. So I would have to take the bus everywhere. And then it was just a big hassle.

468
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:27.840
Jen: So my doctor told me about you guys and how you have it online and how you meet once a week and Brandon drug class and I was like, that's perfect. You know,

469
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.880
Jen: I have no car right now and

470
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.130
Jen: It's a lot simpler for me.

471
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:40.260
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Um, so your doctor is pretty familiar with bright heart or

472
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:53.160
Jen: I guess so, yeah. My I think it was either my doctor or therapist over there. One of the, I think it was my doctor. So building a pest to in the same, you know, in the same position build it.

473
00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:07.980
Richelle Direny: Okay. Um, so you kind of, if you could just give me just a brief history about, you know, how old are you when you got started, you know, what was your drug of choice and what was surrounding

474
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:15.360
Richelle Direny: You know the beginning like as you started the addiction journey. Like if you could just give me a little

475
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.960
Jen: I was about. I want to say maybe about 22

476
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.250
Jen: Maybe 23 I started

477
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:39.360
Jen: With prescription pills and then it led up to heroin so opiates were my drug of choice, but I did drink.

478
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:55.200
Jen: Because I worked at a bar. So, I drank as well. But I did it need the drinking. I could go three, four days working and drink. And then the other days, it wouldn't bother me, but I would have to have my

479
00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:11.910
Jen: My pills. To start off, and then, like I said, it went up to the stronger stuff. Um, I think maybe it was just because I was in the dancing industry so that had a lot to do with it.

480
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:19.530
Jen: And I was in a car accident. So that was another reason I got the prescription pills.

481
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.430
Richelle Direny: Were you on

482
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.510
Jen: Um, it was I believe they were Percocet.

483
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:30.120
OK.

484
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.280
Richelle Direny: OK. Now when you say dancin specifically

485
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.550
Jen: I'm stripping.

486
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.220
Jen: Okay, yeah.

487
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.310
Jen: The money was good but

488
00:48:45.750 --> 00:49:08.670
Jen: I mean I had, I had a great I had fun. It was fun for my, you know, um, but I just, I wish I would have just stayed away from you know the opiates and I would have been okay because I didn't like anything else, I believe I smoked weed twice when I was 16 never touched it again.

489
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:20.310
Jen: I drank one time at 16 never touched it again until I was 21 I'm everything I tried. I did not like cocaine. I didn't like

490
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.250
Jen: Weed I didn't like I never

491
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:31.710
Richelle Direny: Was a marijuana and with the cocaine and everything else, like a one, I'm trying, you're like, I'm not really into this

492
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:45.090
Jen: Yeah, yeah. I didn't like it. Yeah, I tried it and I was like, no, this isn't it. But then once I tried the pals and then the heroine. It was, I was in love with that so

493
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:54.420
Richelle Direny: And, um, and how long were you in the dancing entertainment and

494
00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:02.820
Jen: Um, I started around 18 and I stopped. I want to say about 30

495
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.770
Jen: So 2012 years

496
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:08.850
Richelle Direny: 12 years

497
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:17.790
Jen: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, I was going was

498
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:29.850
Jen: Oh no, I'm just saying I was starting to dance. So I was a. So I would say about for college because I was going to college to become a surgical technologist.

499
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:38.070
Jen: And you know how it is you start dancing and then you don't finish college and yes you stay in that world, you know, and

500
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:48.180
Jen: And I, I made a lot of money, a lot of money working three days a week. I mean, I made as much as a doctor would make a year, if not more.

501
00:50:48.630 --> 00:51:02.730
Jen: And I did not save a penny of that. I mean, I had the cars to show I had the houses the clothes the diamonds, but I never put it away like an idiot to say, you know, so

502
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:14.790
Richelle Direny: Until you said that you once being in that industry, you're saying that it because of the money you you've kind of made that choice to say

503
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:29.370
Richelle Direny: Either continue paying for your go to school and pay for it or walk away from this career, quote unquote, that gave you a whole paid out a whole lot more. Yeah.

504
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:40.710
Jen: Pretty much. And I just, like, and I got instead into the job so heavy. I just stopped going to school. I said, forget it. You know, I make enough money. I only got to work three days a week.

505
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:54.810
Jen: This is the life at that time, you know, but I didn't plan for the future, like how I did starting going into, you know, dancing, all I'm going to finish college and

506
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.280
Jen: But now, it didn't work out like that. Okay.

507
00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:00.960
Richelle Direny: Um,

508
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:17.580
Richelle Direny: Now, so with the opiates. It started specifically when you started the in the entertainment industry 18 and then it just kind of exacerbated from there in terms of the opiate use after the car accident.

509
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:34.650
Jen: Yeah, well, I gotta, I started 18 but i i never drank. I never, I never did anything. I didn't touch any drugs until I was about 22, like I said, when I got to the car accident and

510
00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:49.980
Jen: I mean, I would take a half of an old tram and get sick off of it. That's how you know I DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING BUT I'M FROM THE CAR ACCIDENT for the pain that's when I started and then it just, it wasn't

511
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.150
Jen: I was taking too many. And then one of my friends at at the bar, you know, was doing that stuff and

512
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.240
Jen: I tried it, so

513
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:02.910
Jen: Okay, yeah.

514
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:07.080
Jen: I did start the ope the the heroin. So I was about 23

515
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.620
Richelle Direny: And how long did that going for with the heroin, you

516
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.700
Jen: Have geez, up until six months ago.

517
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:17.820
Jen: Okay, yeah.

518
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.280
Richelle Direny: Now, have you ever been in any kind of inpatient treatment facility.

519
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:33.510
Jen: Yes, I want to met Talbot and Cleveland's I was on probation. I had a

520
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:47.220
Jen: Some charges they were not drug related charges but they suggested me to go into drug court, since it was my first offense. And so I was like okay and

521
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:58.080
Jen: So I, you know, went to jail because I tested positive for drugs because here I go. See this probation officer.

522
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:23.220
Jen: You know, high whatever not thinking that they're going to test me because it's not a drug charge. I'm so from jail. I went to Matt Talbot, that was a 60 day program and then I'm finished probation. After about two years and I was done. And this was about five years ago, so

523
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.290
Richelle Direny: Well, and that's the only inpatient program you've ever gone

524
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:40.140
Jen: On inpatient, yes. I want to detox places, but oh no I'm sorry. There was another impatient one, this was like a year ago.

525
00:54:40.830 --> 00:55:02.790
Jen: On I went through detox and then I went to inpatient who's about 20 days I forgot the name of the place, but it was in a different county. It was about, like, hour and a half away from Cleveland. I can't remember the place. So two and patient places.

526
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.390
Richelle Direny: And then after that, for the most part, they were all patient

527
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:15.690
Jen: Yeah, yeah, just I op, and most of them were just detoxes and I lasted

528
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:27.330
Jen: On a lot of them I lasted quite a long time being sober. But then I would get lonely and bored and that's my thing. When I get lonely when I get bored.

529
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:39.420
Jen: Like if I was if I didn't have my soapbox and now I'm sitting here, I would be little that'd be the excuse. I'm bored I'm lonely, but I'm okay with it now.

530
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.760
Jen: You know, but in the past that would have been an excuse. I'm you.

531
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.010

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.960
Richelle Direny: act of love attempted suicide or suicidal thoughts homicidal anything like that homicide.

577
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:38.700
Jen: Now,

578
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:59.970
Richelle Direny: And you said, How now, with when you were in both inpatient and outpatient out each transition in your program. You were always seeing like seeing a therapist.

579
01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:02.070
Jen: I'm, um,

580
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.780
Jen: But I want to the inpatient the mental that yes

581
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:12.030
Jen: For the first one, the one that I went through about a year ago. It wasn't

582
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:32.910
Jen: I mean I seen I think twice. So it wasn't really like they just wanted to see how I was doing and the programs and but with like I. O. P. And you know the outpatient ones. No, I didn't really see a therapist. I chose to see a therapist but

583
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:34.710
Richelle Direny: Which you never really

584
01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:42.570
Jen: Know I did when I was younger, about the the the abuse.

585
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.220
Jen: But not, you know, not for anything else.

586
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.850
Richelle Direny: Now, I mean, even with the diagnosis, who diagnosed with PTSD, your, your therapist.

587
01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:14.460
Jen: Um, when I was in drug court, the lady had to come to the jail and do assessment. So she put down whatever she put down and I guess her and whoever said PTSD.

588
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.140
Richelle Direny: But then

589
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:16.470
Know,

590
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:28.110
Richelle Direny: And I think PTSD doesn't come under I think comes on and no like anxiety or anything like that. And they never did suggest that you get on medication.

591
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.550
Jen: See I yeah I have anxiety, but it wasn't

592
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:53.940
Jen: Wasn't ever diagnosed like my my current doctor, you know, I told her you know that I have anxiety and you know I was depressed at the time and I needed something. And she said, Oh, well I can't really give you anything you have to see a psychiatrist for that.

593
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.910
Jen: Because you're not diagnosed

594
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:01.440
Jen: So they did give me

595
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.160
Jen: Something for the depression.

596
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:14.730
Jen: Oh gosh, what's the name of the medication called Hold on, I haven't taken it yet because I'm off of the drugs so

597
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.640
Jen: I'm feeling better.

598
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:28.140
Jen: But I'm thinking about just taking it to see to see how it feels. I just don't want to take anything for no reason. Oh, I'm

599
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.840
Jen: So lotsa

600
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:32.880
Richelle Direny: Okay.

601
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:35.280
Jen: Yeah, I haven't started taking in

602
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.850
Jen: My current doctor

603
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:46.290
Jen: Because I was on effect, sir. I'm from my last doctor who is in the same

604
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:55.680
Jen: Name, they're both in neighborhood family practice. I just moved so the doctor I have now is closer to me.

605
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:05.820
Jen: So I didn't have to travel to my, my first doctor. My first doctor gave me a fact, sir. Few years ago. And that worked great. I loved it.

606
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:22.650
Jen: And this doctor. I said, hey, I want to get the effects are back. She said, Well, why was she giving you effect, sir. I'm like, that's what she gave me and she said, well, here I'm gonna give you select saw so I don't know. I don't know.

607
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:37.680
Jen: I don't know what to say about that because I remember my first doctor gave me something. And it made me nauseous and it just, it wasn't working. So, I believe. Maybe that's why she gave me a factor. Hmm. But I don't know.

608
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.980
Richelle Direny: Oh, come now,

609
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.710
Richelle Direny: In turn your family history.

610
01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:53.190
Richelle Direny: And you can talk to. Did you talk to you. Who do you see, do you see Natalie right you can talk to Natalie about all the medication you told her that you were prescribed the

611
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.200
Richelle Direny: The select

612
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:06.120
Jen: No I didn't, because I haven't been taking I didn't take it at all, because I wanted the effects are because that worked really good, but my doctor. The, the newer doctor

613
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:16.530
Jen: I don't know. She's just, I don't know. And then I totally forgot about it that I had it and I just got to refill because they refer on my prescriptions and give them to me.

614
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:28.170
Jen: So I'm debating whether just started or not. But I'm thinking maybe just start it. See how. See how it feels. And if I don't like it then I'll tell my doctor

615
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:44.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Yeah, just talk to them and even listen, you're, you're only you're you are your own self advocate, like if you know that you're on a medication and it works and you don't want to change it. Then you just have to let them know that. No, I'm not.

616
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:51.600
Richelle Direny: Interested and if they can't give you a justifiable reason or one that you can comprehend why they're changing your particular medication.

617
01:04:51.960 --> 01:05:02.910
Richelle Direny: Because the only thing. The only reason why I would think a doctor will change a medication is if you're saying that the one that's driving you prior is no longer working or unless your insurance is saying that they're no longer covering it.

618
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:10.830
Jen: Right. Right. And that that wasn't the case, I think she was like, well, why would she give you a factor for depression and anxiety.

619
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:22.260
Jen: And I'm like, that's what she gave me and then after the fact. I, I thought of it like okay well I think she might have gave me select site and it didn't work because it was making me nauseous.

620
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:29.250
Jen: And it just didn't work right for me. So that's why my doctor gave me that factor. And that worked. Perfect. So

621
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:42.270
Richelle Direny: You gotta see sometimes, you know, you know, not to speak ill of any medical provider, but you have to read go recent go and type in Google. That's what Google is there for just Google name.

622
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:51.180
Richelle Direny: And just see what is the the side effects. If it was, what are the contraindications, especially if you're taking you know you're on other medication.

623
01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:56.160
Richelle Direny: And just kind of have that conversation. And when you go, you know, you kind of have your questions.

624
01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:07.170
Richelle Direny: As to, you know, well you know you prescribe this and I was taking this before and I find that this was better. Why would you prescribe this because based on my research. This is what it's saying. Now you're giving them.

625
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:14.430
Richelle Direny: You're letting them know. Listen, I kind of got a little bit of education. Now you need to let me know the reason why you're doing this.

626
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:15.780
Jen: And let them having

627
01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:21.810
Richelle Direny: One conversation with you because, I mean, you don't want to necessarily be a test prep you want to

628
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.310
Jen: You want to be completely

629
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.080
Richelle Direny: Informed so

630
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:39.480
Jen: I think that's, yeah. That's why I didn't even want to start taking this yet, because I don't want to just be a lab rat and have all this medication in me, you know, and, and now I don't know. I just don't like that, you know, you

631
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:46.740
Richelle Direny: Know advocate for yourself, you know, next thing you know, you're starting to flip out on somebody and you're wondering why and you think it's one

632
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.100
Thing.

633
01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:52.950
Richelle Direny: Well, you know, yeah, definitely have that conversation now.

01:06:53.970 --> 01:07:01.590

677
01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:19.200
Jen: Uh huh. Yeah, he's only 24 so he thinks because he's still young. He's in the partying stage, which I understand, because that's how I was on my my 20s, I still have time to party. You know, before my 30s, but yeah.

678
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:21.060
Jen: He enjoyed getting

679
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:28.920
Jen: Right. I mean, he's been on probation. Um, for tagging. You know what tagging is

680
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:43.470
Jen: Tagging is where you take spray paint like on the train, the train cars where people have their names spray painted on the train cars. That's he has he's gotten in trouble with that something

681
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:45.720
Richelle Direny: On the on the train cart.

682
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:55.410
Jen: Yeah, yeah. It's called a again, which is it's an art. And I think it's beautiful. But you don't do it on people's property, you know,

683
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.210
Jen: Yeah, you don't do that, so

684
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.480
Richelle Direny: Well, interesting.

685
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:04.800
Yeah.

686
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.270
Richelle Direny: Interesting. So, then wouldn't that be a form of vandalizing

687
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:20.280
Jen: Yeah, that's why he was on probation, because of the, I guess would be vandalism or destruction of property, um,

688
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:28.170
Jen: Because he would paint on people's like store property, you know, on the sides.

689
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:29.400
Richelle Direny: Now,

690
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:33.240

692
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.380

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:55.590
Jen: Mom, I don't know if she's still alive. And I don't know if my grandfather's still alive. He's in Florida. I was trying to get

694
01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:07.500
Jen: Get ahold of him for a little while back a couple years ago, but I can't find them and then the things that you look up people they they want you to pay for people's addresses.

695
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:10.620
Jen: Yeah, sorry.

696

698
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:29.580
Jen: So I was looking up his name. I know you know I think I still have my grandma's P. O. Box somewhere. So I got to find out and write her

699
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:52.290
Jen: Oh, because I haven't seen her. I haven't seen my dad's mom since I was probably about 16 1816

700
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:53.010
Richelle Direny: Or 18

701
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:56.100
Jen: Yeah, because my mom and my

702
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:08.190
Jen: Grandma got into it because my grandma said that all she doesn't think that I'm I'm I'm my dad's kid.

703
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:18.510
Jen: Because my mom. Yeah. My mom was messing with somebody else, which I look like my dad I have pictures I look like my dad, you know,

704
01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:22.800
Jen: And she's like, I want to say maybe in her 80s now.

705
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.310
Richelle Direny: And she she still believes that

706
01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:33.120
Jen: I don't know this, I'm saying I haven't talked to her since I was 18 so this was 20 years ago. Oh.

707
01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.270
Jen: I wanna, I want to write her myself.

708
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:40.800
Jen: You know, and talk to her myself now that I'm an adult, you know,

709
01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:50.550
Jen: What and be like, Hey, what's up, I'll take a test, you know, because I have nothing to hide. You know, so

710
01:14:50.580 --> 01:15:00.210
Richelle Direny: You got to be prepared down because it becomes very surreal when you when you engage down waters, you start throwing on waters to go to

711
01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.020
Jen: Right, right.

712
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.580
Richelle Direny: Yes. And then you find out, like, Oh, well, what you know it's somebody's

713
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:24.270
Jen: mom. My mom even said that I'm you know my father's daughter, because she was wasn't even with the guy at that time. I don't even look like the guy you know he's he's totally opposite from what I look like. But, you know, you never know. You never know.

714
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:28.290
Richelle Direny: You never know. But again, like you said, it's, I mean if

715
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:28.800
Richelle Direny: I wanted

716
01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:38.130
Richelle Direny: If you feel like you have something to prove to your grandmother, then by all means, but you're everybody got to brace themselves. And I'm sure that you're going to probably just send it because she was upset with your mom for whatever reason.

717
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:46.890
Jen: Right. Right. And I know she's not. I mean I wouldn't come at her, like, Hey, you know, take this task, you know, but I just, you know, want to

718
01:15:47.280 --> 01:16:00.750
Jen: get in contact with her again, you know, and say, Hey, I'm an adult now I want to have a relationship with you without me being a child and my mom being in the middle of it, you know, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. No.

719
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:09.660
Richelle Direny: That's. I mean, that's that will be noble of you. Um, now what about any kind of mental illness on in your family on either side.

720
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:20.520
Jen: Yeah, my dad's side. I don't know. My mom's side. Nope, nobody except for my mom. My mom has she's bipolar. And

721
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:22.500
Jen: Depression.

722
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.970
Jen: I don't know if you can still that mental illness but

723
01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.940
Richelle Direny: Bipolar. Yes, yes.

724
01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.360
Jen: Yes. I mean, yeah, there's man is if

725
01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.480
Richelle Direny: There isn't you know there's depression, all of it, kind of, it's mixed in. It just depends on the severe

726
01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.930
Jen: Actually she got diagnosed with those two

727
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:44.130
Richelle Direny: And she takes

728
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.270
Richelle Direny: A nap right

729
01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:47.310
Jen: Yeah.

730
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.470
Richelle Direny: And sometimes, some people

731
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:59.700
Richelle Direny: Because of the mental illness. Some people self medicate. And that's why you see that there's the increase in the drug use, because they're self made they use it right

732
01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:09.600
Richelle Direny: They use it because of the, you know, the overwhelming emotions, whether the anxiety, the depression or whatever it is.

733
01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:18.930
Richelle Direny: Some people use the drugs to it's not always because. Oh, it feels so nice and it tastes so wonderful. I mean it's it's

734
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.370
Richelle Direny: Right hand you're using it to self medicate and think about the years that maybe you

735
01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:39.870
Richelle Direny: With your PTSD because of your past sexual trauma and I can see how that PTSD is related to eventually you going into

736
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:49.980
Richelle Direny: The kind of feel that you went into not not not to say that you grew up and says, hey, I would love to be a stripper one

737
01:17:50.670 --> 01:18:02.580
Richelle Direny: But it's definitely related to, you know, the, the PTSD or the sexual trauma and the sense of it. Also, I could see the low self esteem that comes from it.

738
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:09.540
Richelle Direny: I'm not feeling necessarily loved and looking for love in all the wrong places. So there's there's so many that can tell spin out of it.

739
01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:25.860
Richelle Direny: And then the drug use to help you get through it so it keeps you at somewhat of a high this out of body experience that allows you to do what you're doing continuously without feeling the arm you know and knowing

740
01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.800
Richelle Direny: And being completely there in what you're doing.

741
01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.590
Richelle Direny: Now, what about your brother.

742
01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.580
Jen: Want to know

743
01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:41.730
Richelle Direny: Lucy got diagnosed with a mental illness.

744
01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:46.770
Jen: Now, he doesn't. I mean, doesn't go to the doctor.

745
01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:54.090
Jen: For anything you know unless he has to. But now my mom never took him.

746
01:18:55.170 --> 01:19:03.330
Jen: To the doctor for anything. I know, I'm sorry. He was, he had ADHD when he was a child.

747
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:13.830
Jen: And he was he was so hyper and my mom gave him the medication which calmed him down. But then he would gain a little bit of weight.

748
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:28.140
Jen: So that they were trying to give him medication that would calm them down, but yet not make them chunky because he's not. He is tall and thin, and he can eat your whole refrigerator and not you know gain a pound.

749
01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:31.470
Jen: SO jealous of that but

750
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.330
Richelle Direny: You're all jealous of that.

751
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:53.490
Jen: Right. But I mean, he's only 24 anyways. But yeah. Now that you say that, yeah, when he was when he was a child. But other than that, he's never gone back to get any medication. Maybe that's why he smokes weed, you know, but he's not hyper anymore. What

752
01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:55.650
Richelle Direny: Can we do not going to be hyper

753
01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:08.730
Jen: Blah. Right. Right. But even if he doesn't smoke because he won't smoke it every day. But it's just I don't know he's an adult now so I don't know, I can't explain it. It's just, it's

754
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.160
Richelle Direny: Definitely a little bit. He's probably calmed down a little bit where he's not as hyper

755
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.360
Jen: Oh, yeah.

756
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:16.140
Jen: Yeah, you

757
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:17.070
Have any children.

758
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:23.670
Jen: No, I was pregnant once, but I did not have it. Mm hmm.

759
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:29.430
Jen: I was 17

760
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:41.040
Jen: Well, a month we took before, not even like two and a half weeks before I turned 17 I found out I was pregnant. I think

761
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.760
Jen: Because I only had sex like two times

762
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.490
Richelle Direny: In your mom was aware

763
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:56.430
Jen: Yeah, she's like, Oh, I already knew before you took the test because my I guess my emotions, you know, huh.

764
01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:58.800
Richelle Direny: You

765
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:14.010
Jen: Yeah, I wasn't my mom didn't like I wasn't ready, you know, I was only 17 and I wasn't ready but then I would I change my mind. I'm like, we would go to the clinic.

766
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:32.430
Jen: To go get it. The procedure done and I was like, Okay, no, I'm not gonna do this I changed my mind. So we would leave. And then the next day. I'm like, Okay, well, I want to go back. So, I mean, I finally went back and did it, um, because I just, I guess I I felt like I wasn't ready, you know,

767
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:36.660
Jen: So that

768
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.140
Richelle Direny: emotionally and mentally. How was it after for you.

769
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:47.190
Jen: Oh god I stuck it was horrible, like, like there's still times that I'm like

770
01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.650
Jen: Why did I do that.

771
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:59.400
Jen: Because, like, if the kid would have been like 21 years old right now. You know, my brother's age.

772
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:00.900
Jen: And I think

773
01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.750
Jen: Like, I'm going to get emotional. Now, but

774
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:18.000
Jen: Like, I think maybe like my life would have been different, like one of the became a stripper and a druggie and what I went to college and had my shit together, you know,

775
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.240
Jen: And then I just wonder what you know my kid would have been like, and

776
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.450
Jen: You know, stuff like that. So it's hard for me sometimes.

777
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.040
Richelle Direny: It's okay. Have you ever had counseling to talk about that.

778
01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:50.760
Jen: Oh yeah, like with everything you know like like I got over it. I mean, but it's just hard sometimes for me because like I said, Maybe I became a junkie.

779
01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.190
Jen: And done something better with my life. No.

780
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.450
Richelle Direny: Hope.

781
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:03.000
Richelle Direny: The hope is that regardless if you do because life, life happens

782
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:10.230
Richelle Direny: That's not the only thing that you've gone through, you know, you have other things that you have gone through, you have experienced in life.

783
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:27.330
Richelle Direny: You know, life happens things happen to the decision. You may have are always based on your current circumstances. No one gets up and says, hey, you know what I want to do drugs and you like I said, you know, strip or do it. Nobody, nobody thinks that way.

784
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:34.530
Richelle Direny: Life happens you're in a situation. Sometimes you think that that's

785
01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:50.640
Richelle Direny: The choices we make a lot of the times it's due to really overwhelming emotions that you don't know how to control and how to get through work through them in a healthy manner and sometimes you choose the the decisions you make. It's like you always

786
01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.480
Richelle Direny: In life, all of us. We're always faced with a fork and

787
01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:56.520
Jen: It's

788
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.170
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like a

789
01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:05.400
Richelle Direny: What is it the fork with with what they call them sparks with the three there's you continue

790
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:08.250
Richelle Direny: On do you go

791
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.300
Richelle Direny: This direction or do you go that direction, but

792
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.620
Jen: Either direction you go

793
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:23.160
Richelle Direny: It doesn't really truly give you, um, it doesn't really tell you exactly what's on What's at the end or what the journey is going to look like.

794
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:36.450
Richelle Direny: You have an idea. And so you have to choose and sometimes depending on our life, our history, what we're going through in the current moment, sometimes you just want a relief from how you're feeling

795
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:44.280
Richelle Direny: And you take the easy road road stops you from feeling, but then those emotions is what makes you stronger in the end.

796
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.780
Richelle Direny: So yeah, but you know to say

797
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.410
Yeah.

798
01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.300
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

799
01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:11.460
Jen: I was gonna say, and I'm and I was so young, like my mom had me when she was 19 and um and I didn't want to have a kid because I grew up poor you know like we didn't have nothing for nothing.

800
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:21.210
Jen: And I didn't want to have the kid and have my kid grow up like I grew up, and that is another reason why I became a dancer.

801
01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:32.130
Jen: Because I told myself I don't ever want to live like the way I lived. When I was a child. So maybe those has something to do with it to

802
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.480
Jen: I mean my grandma. When I went to my grandma's house in my aunt's house they would spoil me but I didn't want to come home.

803
01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:55.530
Jen: You know, I would cry, I'd be like, I don't want to go home because I know what's at home, waiting for me, whether it be the abuse no food, you know, going to school, getting made fun of because I never got new school clothes. You know what I mean.

804
01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:04.020
Jen: So I didn't want my kid to be like that either, you know, girl, a poor like I did.

805
01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:18.270
Richelle Direny: I mean, like I said, you know, things happen there. There's so many different things that happens in your life and we make the decisions we do. Um,

806
01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:26.160
Richelle Direny: Weren't you were you now. You did say you have no pending. So you've never been married right

807
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.080
Jen: Right.

808
01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:30.750
Jen: No married

809
01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:33.390
Richelle Direny: There's your well

810
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.800
Jen: I know you say your brother has his

811
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.120
Jen: Young. Does he have children.

812
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.540
Jen: No, no.

813
01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:41.460
Jen: Thank God.

814
01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:48.900
Jen: He's been with the same girl since like 1617

815
01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:52.020
Richelle Direny: Okay. Well, that's good.

816
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:52.410
Yeah.

817
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:54.480
Jen: Yeah.

818
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:58.590
Richelle Direny: Were you born. You were born and raised in Ohio.

819
01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.650
Jen: Know I'm from Michigan. I was born in Pontiac Michigan um

820
01:27:05.730 --> 01:27:13.920
Jen: And then I moved to Detroit in the suburbs of Detroit and then I met somebody on my space.

821
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:21.330
Jen: Yes, and I moved down here when I was like 25

822
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:32.070
Jen: So for this, this person that I should have just stayed up in Michigan, because that's where my family was all my friends were

823
01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:42.150
Jen: Just everybody was there and I left everything everybody for this person that we were only together for three and a half years.

824
01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.870
Jen: And then pretty much I was abandoned down here with no friends. I still don't have very many friends down here.

825
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:57.210
Jen: Um, it's just different that people are different down here. Um, I remember living and Brunswick.

826
01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:14.370
Jen: Because we moved all my girlfriend was in Brunswick and I moved to Brunswick for the first six months until we move to Lakewood, which is outskirts of Cleveland. Um, but I went off into, like, I guess the ghetto.

827
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:22.800
Jen: At a place I didn't know with this drug, girl. I wanted to go get drugs and I got a gun to my head.

828
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:37.500
Jen: Oh wow, and and robbed you know in a bad part of town when that has never happened to me in Detroit ever so it's just Cleveland is a, it's a really, really different.

829
01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:47.940
Jen: It's just different compared to Detroit. Detroit, maybe, like, people say, Oh, I feel sorry for you here from Detroit don't feel sorry for me because

830
01:28:48.900 --> 01:29:01.320
Jen: The people are better up there. They're nicer. The real art, you know, I can't really explain it. It's just different. And I just wish I would have stayed up there. I mean, but that's what love will do

831
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:08.250
Jen: Bring it down here and I shouldn't move back up there, but I don't know why did it.

832
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:11.280
Jen: Well,

833
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:15.540
Richelle Direny: They always say, you know, the grass is always greener on the other side until you get there.

834
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:18.330
Richelle Direny: And when well it's not even that green

835
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:19.680
Jen: Right.

836
01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:25.500
Jen: The Mirage is just me. Right. I should have stayed on my side of the grass.

837
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:28.350
Richelle Direny: There you go. There you go.

838
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:32.250
Richelle Direny: And now you're you are currently working right.

839
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:51.930
Jen: No, I'm not working. I do like I clean a couple friends houses like under the table, but it's nothing. You know, I can't, you know, it's pretty much I'm trying to get my food stamps back. It's just I can't afford nothing right now.

843
01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:25.980
Jen: And I'm because you know I'm making enough money, not just sitting up say anything bad but um and my counselor was like, Why don't you put your name.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:44.160
Jen: You know, in the RAF fall. And I'm like, Okay. Might as well to try it out and they picked my name. So I got Section eight and by the grace of God. I found something because it is really, really hard to find something nice in Cleveland, that takes Section eight

845
01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:45.840
Jen: Yeah, really, really hard.

846
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.750
Richelle Direny: Section eight on a whole it's very hard to to get

847
01:30:49.350 --> 01:31:12.030
Jen: Right, so, um, so yeah, so that is paid for. So what I just have to pay far as the lights and the gas, which I'm a little behind on I'm in food which I was getting food stamps for a while, but then they cut me off. So I'm trying to get them back.

853
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:45.330
Jen: And I just so happened because it says the date underneath the time

Jen: Um, whenever this virus thing had but on because if you guys, I'm not going to go to my therapist if you guys you know are going to see me to because you know I don't like repeating myself over and over again.

881
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.820
Richelle Direny: And I do agree if you're seeing a therapist outside I

882
01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:34.110
Richelle Direny: Mean it wouldn't be beneficial to you to see one again. Um, how about on the 15th for

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:09.480

01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:20.130
Richelle Direny: With with the corona with everything and you know a lot of places shutting down

927
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.370
Melonie Powers: Well, I've been home.

928
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:26.850
Melonie Powers: Because all of the stuff that I was doing

929
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.760
Melonie Powers: Was in Walmart.

930
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:39.510
Melonie Powers: And pharmacies, you know, resetting for these merchandising, and all that stuff. So I've been on I and I actually got sick.

931
01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:43.470
Melonie Powers: To do one final reset.

932
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:46.050
Melonie Powers: That

933
01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:59.190
Melonie Powers: But they don't have. They didn't have test. So this is like right now about three weeks later, you know, and I don't know. I could have just had a call that could have flu. You know what I mean.

934
01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:04.080
Melonie Powers: I know I had the fever, and I had a call for a couple of days and then

935
01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:09.360
Melonie Powers: My body hurts so bad, it just

936
01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:28.050
Melonie Powers: But then also, I know that a twist my back out because I was picking out boxes that the guys usually pick up that I was moving on my way and I just made this wrong, because I can pick it up correctly because I wear my cell phone.

937
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:33.900
Melonie Powers: It doesn't matter. I just twisted the wrong way and then now my back.

938
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:43.710
Melonie Powers: Reversing sun. And so I need to go back to my back doctor to figure out what I did do it. Number one, and

939
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:47.400
Melonie Powers: Okay, and then

940
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:56.850
Melonie Powers: What they can do to if they can inject it or whatever they might be able to do. And then also, I went

941
01:39:57.810 --> 01:40:09.870
Melonie Powers: You know, I've been working trying to save the money to get my teeth work done. And because I have this one right you know in the front, almost not that one apartment there.

942
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:24.300
Melonie Powers: And it's broken literally in half and then. So when I saw my regular, normal doctor she put me on air about it was hurting and probably because of being sick, you know, my whole system is down.

943
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.620
Richelle Direny: But did you get tested.

944
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.140
Melonie Powers: No, they don't have test. I know just now starting to get this like this week.

945
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:42.390
Melonie Powers: We can I just saw her, I saw her when I was done with it. Like I had already been home for two weeks and I literally

946
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.780
Melonie Powers: On that 14th day she and I just happened to have that appointment.

947
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.250
Melonie Powers: I see her every three months.

948
01:40:48.780 --> 01:41:06.150
Melonie Powers: But I just, it just happened to fall on the 14th day so I got my return to work and I wasn't having a fever and like that anymore. So when I called the oral surgeon, because this is considered an emergency, especially that it's infected, you know, broken

949
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:26.160
Melonie Powers: They don't have the year. The only thing they can do is pull it. So what I need to have done is for them. The yes bullet, but be able to put something temporary temporarily in place until they're able to put

950
01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:27.990
Melonie Powers: One of those

951
01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:30.210
Melonie Powers: Fake, you know, a

952
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.920
Richelle Direny: Marshal

953
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:40.560
Melonie Powers: Will they'll have to do that at first that will while it's healing, but then they fix the post field post in there was a call.

954
01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:44.760
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think a post like a part of something that they put in there like a temporary

955
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.620
Melonie Powers: They so on.

956
01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:50.130
Richelle Direny: Temporary cap and then when you go back to get the actual thing.

957
01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:52.590
Melonie Powers: Yeah, and they'll put a

958
01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:53.850
Richelle Direny: Okay, you

959
01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.160
Melonie Powers: Know like it's a

960
01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:07.920
Melonie Powers: It's like a replacement to say drill up in New York on because it's so close to the front of my mom, you know, I'm. Oh, I don't want to have

961
01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:12.450
Melonie Powers: That adventure. I can't do that.

962
01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:14.100

Richelle Direny: You're too young for that you can't be

994
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.680
Richelle Direny: You really just have to learn what do you, what else are you going to do, just watch because just like really

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:57.870
Melonie Powers: You know what I yeah I vote. That's all I can do.

Richelle Direny: That's all you can do. And you hope that it is your vote does count in that something comes of it and everything works out. Okay, that's all you can do. But overall, how was everything on the homefront how's everything been going

Melonie Powers: I don't want to fight every day and you don't want to fight he knows when to leave, you know, like, as I say, I started taking my hormone pills.

1005
01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:54.840
Melonie Powers: And if I get too many of those or do I go off the deep end. But, you know, we have two dogs here and

1006
01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:11.370
Melonie Powers: I've got one dogs that are all the time. I had to give them a special slows down and eating and another one that when he gets afraid he says on the floor and with that wood floors and clean streets and

1008
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:23.190

1009
01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.780
Richelle Direny: Everybody knows, even though the dogs and the cats know it's time to go.

1010
01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.280
Melonie Powers: Yeah, they'll

1011
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:46.350
Melonie Powers: The dogs like throw aside because I can't you know these are recipes all of her doctor rescue animals eat. I can't beat them. It's like he just wants to get out of my house.

1012
01:46:49.770 --> 01:47:00.240
Melonie Powers: And then the cat now. So my cat is so old that he's walking around and he's got, you know, little clumps of poop coming out of this. But you don't even realize it.

1013
01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.100
Richelle Direny: And he's an older dog.

1014
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:05.460

1016
01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:16.680
Melonie Powers: We'll see you know about. I'm more concerned about his quality of life you know these guys.

1017
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:23.130
Melonie Powers: You know, we'll see what's going on. I don't know. None of that scenario and he's definitely gonna go to bed.

1018
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:27.690
Melonie Powers: So it's I meant to call today, but I was dealing with

1019
01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:33.810
Melonie Powers: bankruptcy attorney and we were talking about

1020
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.770
Melonie Powers: Social Security disability and

1021
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.630
Melonie Powers: This year I only made 3085 tell her.

1022
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.330
Melonie Powers: From working

1023
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:47.310
Richelle Direny: For the whole year.

1024
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:49.140
Melonie Powers: For the whole year.

1025
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:53.100
Richelle Direny: But when you make that little you still file taxes.

1026
01:47:53.880 --> 01:48:05.100
Melonie Powers: As 3000 well my we we filed jointly it pay our tax returns, up to 30 $400

1027
01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:30.000
Melonie Powers: If we file separately. Way down to like 600 bucks a person live something and that I'm trying to find out with the attorney. That's why I've been saving money, who's an attorney why men doing all the hard work. It shouldn't be doing it messes me up, but I'm

1028
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:39.060
Melonie Powers: So I'm trying to figure out how we can file our taxes jointly and protect him from my student loan.

1029
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.070
Melonie Powers: Because I don't have an income right now, not

1030
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:47.340
Richelle Direny: When she saw, wouldn't you do it jointly but separately.

1031
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.040
Melonie Powers: Yeah, that lowers our

1032
01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:51.180
Richelle Direny: Theory, but separate

1033
01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:59.550
Melonie Powers: Right, but that lower third car down to like $1,000 getting like 3600 back

1034
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.250
Melonie Powers: So I'm trying to figure out that so

1035
01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:15.750
Melonie Powers: I'm journey, a copy of because we've already got them done. It shows both ways, you know, just, I don't know how I'm feeling.

1036
01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:26.280
Melonie Powers: In 2000 2003 you know there's any interest for all these years. Another for $34,000

1037
01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:43.530
Melonie Powers: Something crazy. I know. And I can't. I know they can't go away and bankruptcy. But the reality is, you know, just even trying to put put put my garden in, you know, the last couple days just the bending.

1038
01:49:45.150 --> 01:49:48.660
Melonie Powers: I've had so much going on my back. They did the receiver to

1039
01:49:50.190 --> 01:49:56.940
Melonie Powers: Yeah, they did the procedure for all of arthritis on my else to down on both sides.

1040
01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:18.390
Melonie Powers: But then I also have a bulging disc. Can I have a very big phones for on the lower side. And then over here I have where the SI joint was literally pulled out. So just trying to do things and it messes everything up. So if I sit for too long.

1041
01:50:19.710 --> 01:50:25.200
Melonie Powers: If I lay the wrong way. If I stand for too long. Everything is a disaster.

1042
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:43.620
Melonie Powers: And then when that is Jay, just really like my job. You know, like testing. When the customers. We do have that. But you know when you're dealing with shit like that all time. I don't have a temperament. I'll have that

1043
01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:47.820
Melonie Powers: Yesterday, no, no. I know how to

1044
01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:51.060
Melonie Powers: Have that control.

1045
01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:55.530
Melonie Powers: And then that could also be from, you know,

1046
01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.190
Melonie Powers: Through my head. Pretty good.

1047
01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:06.840
Richelle Direny: Oh you talking about when was it the overdose. You're talking about

1048
01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.990
Melonie Powers: But there was a purpose. I mean,

1049
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:11.970

1127
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.830
Melonie Powers: And

1128
01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:50.010
Melonie Powers: We're having a new roof, but on because the wind, you know, all these forms that have come through. So we've got the clean insurance. We have roofers come in.

1129
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.560
Melonie Powers: To do the roof and

1130
01:57:53.610 --> 01:58:02.760
Melonie Powers: Then my garden like next to the pool. You know what I mean that I and I enlarged it this year and I put in

1131
01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:12.990
Melonie Powers: To blackberry bushes to raspberry bushes and last year. Strawberries are coming through, like, am

1132
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:17.220
Also you plant vegetation and all these different things.

1133
01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:29.820
Melonie Powers: Yeah. Well, last year was my first garden here and I learned a lot about that. And a lot of things come up and grow. So I think I've got my soil. Right. And I've got my spacing. Right.

1134
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:49.620
Melonie Powers: Things like that. This year, but like the fruit stuff is out on the Hill back there because I want these to be busy halfway, because we were that's another thing battling a carpenter bees right now they litter. There's so many out there, they bump up against it goes. So you just got

1135
01:58:50.640 --> 01:59:01.020
Melonie Powers: To have the Hastings as the full of these that are to him, and then he walks around with the spray on their whole it's under the stack and

1136
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:08.700
Melonie Powers: You know, something that we have to get on top of it soon as they start with, we got a good

1137
01:59:09.810 --> 01:59:12.540
Richelle Direny: Seems like your property alone keeps you very very busy.

1138
01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:14.460
Melonie Powers: Yeah.

1139
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:17.340
Melonie Powers: We already have to mow the lawn.

1140
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:29.010
Melonie Powers: But we have a writing more. And that's an inside joke for my back out again. It was wet. If it rains that, you know, a day and a half later, I went out tomorrow, we have on on the hills.

1141
01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:38.400
Melonie Powers: I mean, like, and so the first time that I got stuck. I tried to yank it out myself. Like, you know, the john deere

1142
01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:39.330
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

1143
01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:49.500
Melonie Powers: And then I get stuck again and then I called him to help me and but I hurt my back so bad that this today's the first day that I've been up late.

1144
01:59:51.840 --> 02:00:10.710
Melonie Powers: And I don't mean without pain. I mean, this is I've had consistently my my patches on and my medications work, but this was the first day that I was able to get back out, check on the garden that I didn't do anything out there today just sprinkled some like snail stuff you

1145
02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.970
Melonie Powers: Know stuff out. But I didn't do anything because I can't

1146
02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:17.460
Melonie Powers: I don't want to hurt myself.

1147
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:22.080
Melonie Powers: No, it was that so

1148
02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:34.170
Richelle Direny: This time being home. It sounds like you guys are. You're both looking at all the things that needs to be done around the property around the house and start working on getting those things done together.

1149
02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:38.250
Melonie Powers: Now they've added be done.

1150
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:53.220
Richelle Direny: Well, it seems like a great time to maybe have some one on one conversations and just, you know, outside of just being civil but just kind of iron through some of the, you know,

1151
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:55.560
Richelle Direny: Maybe

1152
02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:03.990
Richelle Direny: The things that you guys have just work on the relationship. Overall, or you're just not necessarily there.

1153
02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:11.790
Melonie Powers: What happened, you know,

1154
02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:18.540
Melonie Powers: That happened.

1155
02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:21.630
Melonie Powers: I don't know.

1156
02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.090
Melonie Powers: Mentally, we all get over it.

1157
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:26.040
Melonie Powers: You know, someday that probably not.

1158
02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:36.540
Richelle Direny: Well, listen, I mean, no matter what it is, no matter how big or small, you can. It's to say to get over it is to say that

1159
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:39.690
Richelle Direny: You know,

1160
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:51.060
Richelle Direny: How can I put it, because you can't just get over something you have to come to have your full both parties have to be fully aware of the issues.

1161
02:01:51.540 --> 02:02:01.050
Richelle Direny: Both party has to come to some kind of acknowledgement of the issues that's causing the demise of the relationship, the breakdown in the communication.

1162
02:02:01.530 --> 02:02:11.220
Richelle Direny: The emotional discourse is causing on each other. So to say to get over it, it means that you don't want to acknowledge you don't want to talk about. You don't want to work through

1163
02:02:11.610 --> 02:02:18.300
Richelle Direny: All of the issues. So there's the concept of sweeping it all under the carpet. But then eventually it grows into a big mountain

1164
02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:26.280
Melonie Powers: Mountain party there you know it's you know it's been brought up. He's apologize.

1165
02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:28.020
Melonie Powers: For any

1166
02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:29.730
Change.

1167
02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:31.950
Melonie Powers: You know,

1168
02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:33.360
Mm hmm.

1169
02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:40.920
Richelle Direny: But then it comes from. Do you, would you like to because

1170
02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:49.320
Richelle Direny: The other thing is, I mean, I have all the other issues, your findings in the financial problems. And I know you're working on that.

1171
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:59.730
Richelle Direny: Through bankruptcy, you have your underlining medical issues. That's just things that those are yours that you're working through you also have

1172
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:07.470
Richelle Direny: The strain in the relationship with your son and working through that. So those are things that are yours to those are yours.

1173
02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:15.540
Richelle Direny: But then the other piece of it is the relationship. So all of that collectively all of these individual things are pretty big things.

1174
02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:31.950
Richelle Direny: That can impact our mental stability or mental and emotional stability and if you know going through the healing process. If you don't work through them. The question is, what are you healing.

1175
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.870
Well, you

1176
02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:41.040
Melonie Powers: Know when I go to work and you know I lose my temper.

1177
02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:45.000
Melonie Powers: You know and do thing.

1178
02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:51.780
Melonie Powers: Just like you know these last few years I was obviously apparently

1179
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:54.990
Melonie Powers: Not been able to hold a job.

1180
02:03:55.770 --> 02:03:56.310
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

1181
02:03:56.490 --> 02:04:05.040
Melonie Powers: You know, and or and or get hired because of them through so many jobs and then I go man that looks awful nobody will hire me.

1182
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:11.490
Melonie Powers: And then, you know, I've got appointments that you know like I I canceled.

1183
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:18.180
Melonie Powers: My gynecologist I can't hold my, my bad doctor I canceled.

1184
02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:31.530
Melonie Powers: My LG doctor because I was, I was working, you know, it's like they tell you the last minute, what your things are going to be. But when I was doing, you know, I can take

1185
02:04:33.930 --> 02:04:37.140
Melonie Powers: Like the one week when the last

1186
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:46.080
Melonie Powers: Session, we had and what I thought was last Monday session. It took those days off.

1187
02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:55.290
Melonie Powers: We didn't matter all second everything that's going on anyway. And because I had already hurt my back and I was done with it.

1188
02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:14.100
Melonie Powers: But the route, but I was able to schedule that you know not asked for work those days to get even get it approved so I had taken those days off. But, you know, just trying to try to I'm trying to save money to do all this stuff. But, you know, then I'm neglecting other things that

1189
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:26.220
Melonie Powers: You know, need to be handled and especially with my back because Lucky me bad there's just, you know, you know, I'm heading towards this event.

1190
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:30.750
Melonie Powers: You know, I've always been, I've always been

Melonie Powers: You know, been dealing with that stuff my you know that car accident and they told me that when I got older, that I was going to really pay for it.

1192
02:05:42.660 --> 02:06:01.710
Melonie Powers: And they weren't getting, you know, they weren't lying. And that's what I'm dealing with now it's time for us as we were you know let me stop diving, you know, because I couldn't win the current get out of the water and then you know go work and stuff because of the 30 myself.

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.410
Richelle Direny: So from from back in your days of diet. Did you hurt your back at one point in diving.

1196
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:38.250
Melonie Powers: Well, it's just, it's just gotten hurt passively board with all the arthritis that song for haven't heard, you know, the whole thing is all the different things that keep adding on to it.

Melonie Powers: Is that it's a lot different than being under the water by your current you know we do our deep dive like you're hanging out.

1200
02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:12.720
Melonie Powers: You know, you're very deep water and the curses from your body is sideways your woman aligned on one hand, and you're holding your literally breathe around the you know the other, but your side with me.

1201
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:20.460
Melonie Powers: Trying to get down and then once you let go, you got it. You know, you've got to be able to

1202
02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:22.950
Melonie Powers: And I can't do it anymore.

1203
02:07:25.650 --> 02:07:27.930
Melonie Powers: And that was several years ago, you know,

1204
02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:30.450
Melonie Powers: That has stopped that.

1205
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:39.360
Melonie Powers: Now I can get. And I guess when because it's different. I'm in a controlled environment here, you know, and I for

1206
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:49.650
Melonie Powers: It was different, even when I was just so you know, with my floater you know areas in the key. You know, we can calm.

1207
02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:58.200
Melonie Powers: Not big ocean thing, you know, I mean, though, it's the ocean. But if you don't have wave read like surfer, anything like that, you know,

1208
02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:03.510
Melonie Powers: So I could just go out there and chill and relax and not not worry about it.

1209
02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:05.490
You know,

1210
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:10.860
Melonie Powers: Change.

1211
02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:22.710
Richelle Direny: I mean it. Like I said, it is it is a lot individually going on. I'm not individually meaning like there's a lot of individual things, I should say.

1212
02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:25.380
Richelle Direny: That you have

1213
02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.400
Richelle Direny: Gone through that definitely

1214
02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:38.820
Richelle Direny: You know affects your emotional and mental state of mind to be able to process it all so

1215
02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:43.980
Richelle Direny: When you look at the in the grand scheme of things, everything that you have going on.

1216
02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:46.440
Richelle Direny: It's really hard to

1217
02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:56.370
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like what do I address. How do I, how do I go about address it and then just also just life's life's changes.

1218
02:08:58.290 --> 02:08:59.790
Richelle Direny: In all the changes and are you

1219
02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:04.020
Richelle Direny: Are you mentally ready for a lot of those changes that life comes with

1220
02:09:07.050 --> 02:09:07.560
Melonie Powers: No.

1221
02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:15.600
Melonie Powers: And but then the question is,

1222
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:21.090
Richelle Direny: You're not ready for it as it's coming. Regardless if you want to slow it down or not it's going to come

1223
02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:29.280
Richelle Direny: You know, how is that affecting you know how is that having an impact on you.

1224
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:46.740
Melonie Powers: What is my self esteem. Mm hmm. Like you know my think I finally knock on wood along the third month of a totally different way of dealing with my skin.

1225
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:56.820
Melonie Powers: You've got it pretty cleared up without scars are still there. A couple of little breakouts, but nothing like what it was. So

1226
02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:06.270
Melonie Powers: For some, you know, I get into such a pissy about things like I get so wound up and in and I mean long term.

1227
02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:18.390
Melonie Powers: You know, so for all these years I've been, you know, strip in my stand and trying to turn like false over you know all these claims they make it really was.

1228
02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:23.400
Melonie Powers: Taken all the oils out burning my skin and hurting myself. Finally,

1229
02:10:24.570 --> 02:10:47.070
Melonie Powers: I was reading this article. And just finally done them in your corner about the fall, wanting to be gentle and you need to be seeing like right now I'm using, like, I'm like a cream cleanser and then the toner that I have is not like a which is moisturizing toner.

1230
02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:59.940
Melonie Powers: Fermented stuff and all this crap. And then I put on like a colloidal silver fight bacteria. And then I put on 100% you know

1231
02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:21.840
Melonie Powers: Fully organic small batch produce moisturizers now and then I switched my makeup and I'm like, what was the one thing. Should I would be my 35, you know, so now I'm using, you know, make a hook that shouldn't let you know that I had to change my thinking.

1232
02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:27.720
Melonie Powers: Of course, you know, a lot of things, but not sticking with it now for three months.

1233

1234
02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.420
Melonie Powers: So that helps me because that that helps me a lot, actually.

1235
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.440
Melonie Powers: Because I don't feel self conscious

1236
02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:52.140
Melonie Powers: These are me. I just, you know, I didn't want to

02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:55.290
Melonie Powers: Shower, but I mean, yeah, then down eight. So you got our family.

1257
02:13:56.850 --> 02:13:58.560
Melonie Powers: Time you know

1258
02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:01.980
Melonie Powers: I don't want to say was neglecting myself because it's you.

1259
02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:04.110
Melonie Powers: Know,

1260
02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:13.740
Melonie Powers: And it's overwhelming and you know enough to walk, walk upstairs a shower and they go, no, you know,

1261
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:30.390
Richelle Direny: It does do something to you know make you feel good when you, you know, kind of get the especially if you've been in the house for a week or two, and you're not doing anything. So then you start

1262
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:41.940
Richelle Direny: You know, putting on your, your girlfriends or whatever you do. I mean, it does, it does give you some boost in your self esteem and just your self worth, and how you look, it makes you look good, or feel good.

1263
02:14:42.690 --> 02:14:43.560
I would say

1264
02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:52.650
Melonie Powers: Like I like but I'm also a customer that is because, like in my symbol. It's been so bad, like that I would do that anyway.

1265
02:14:53.670 --> 02:15:00.060
Melonie Powers: So there you know and it's the same thing with group and except for I showed

1266
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:08.220
Melonie Powers: One group and I had just one of those nights when I was looking at home in the morning and

1267
02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:11.670
Melonie Powers: For your fitness and I had to go back

1268
02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:21.960
Melonie Powers: Excuse me from the group, please, because I can't sleep, you know, that was the only time I think I've ever seen any without, you know,

1269
02:15:23.850 --> 02:15:26.310
Melonie Powers: That way we don't want it, but

1270
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:36.780
Richelle Direny: It comes, it comes down to mind over matter too because um it's thinking about it like this, the concept that

1271
02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:44.730
Richelle Direny: You think like, Oh, I gotta do this because you know I'm going to be on camera, and everybody's going to see me and I need to put on my makeup in this than the other.

1272
02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:53.400
Richelle Direny: The reality is, remember, it's just, it's your it's your mind. It's how you see yourself you're seeing like I'm if you look into the camera.

1273
02:15:53.970 --> 02:16:07.680
Richelle Direny: Yes, you see me. I see you, but I also see a reflection of myself. And when I see that reflection of myself. I am going to critique everything I see because I see all the things that I personally don't feel comfortable with.

1274
02:16:08.070 --> 02:16:10.620
Melonie Powers: That's what I'm seeing right now because

1275
02:16:10.710 --> 02:16:11.520
Richelle Direny: I see.

1276
02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:12.600
Richelle Direny: The things that

1277
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:26.280
Richelle Direny: I don't feel comfortable with. I think that's all you're looking at. And so, and that's vice versa, naturally, that's how we are, it kind of goes back to when you were a teenager. And you remember when you would have

1278
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:31.590
Richelle Direny: The zits or the pimples and you would have one that will get really big you

1279
02:16:32.430 --> 02:16:35.730
Richelle Direny: Know, huge you feel like Pinocchio

1280
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:46.020
Richelle Direny: In that moment, man. You think everyone sees you like Pinocchio, or the one that just have these big exits on your face. And guess what

1281
02:16:46.770 --> 02:16:54.870
Richelle Direny: Because you're so self conscious of it you, it affects your self esteem effects how you look affects how you feel about yourself.

1282
02:16:55.350 --> 02:17:14.520
Richelle Direny: But nobody really is paying attention until you pointed out, because nobody. It's all of your mental what you see the imperfections and that's mentally it just your mind just blows up all of your imperfections and you're the only one that's struggling with it. No one sees it, so

1283
02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:24.030
Richelle Direny: That's why it goes back to you have to love the you that you see in the mirror you no matter what it is.

1284
02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.740
Richelle Direny: What all with all of it's an

1285
02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:36.810
Richelle Direny: Important one is perfect. So you have to love the you that you see. But you think that no one loves the you that you see, because you are not so fond of the you that you see.

1286
02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:47.580
Richelle Direny: And that's, that's really what it comes down to. You're not very fond of it. So, because you're not fond of it. You think that no, no one and it's kind of like

1287
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:57.090
Richelle Direny: You will think to yourself, and this is just an example. You'll think to yourself, well, my husband doesn't love me, my husband doesn't care. My husband doesn't this well. The question is, do you love you.

1288
02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:02.280
Richelle Direny: Do you care about you. Because then it's all about how you feel.

1289
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:12.780
Richelle Direny: And if you feel that way. You're then going to take that feeling and put it on that next individual and no matter what that individual is saying to you.

1290
02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:27.360
Richelle Direny: You're never going to believe what that individual says to you, because those are things that those are the emotions that you struggle with because of what your internal battles are has nothing to do with the other person like for

1291
02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:28.380
Melonie Powers: liking you know saying

1292
02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:34.680
Melonie Powers: I don't know that you know night and I said hey, you know, and especially, you know,

1293
02:18:36.630 --> 02:18:43.020
Melonie Powers: Well, you know, when I went through that whole foods. I think that was my third tried. I got it done.

1294
02:18:44.610 --> 02:18:45.120
Melonie Powers: You know,

1295
02:18:46.350 --> 02:18:50.190
Melonie Powers: And I've always said after that, you know, have a lot of regards to my own life.

1296
02:18:51.210 --> 02:18:52.560
Melonie Powers: I haven't three years.

1297
02:18:53.730 --> 02:18:54.510
Melonie Powers: I still don't.

1298
02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:59.160
Richelle Direny: Because the question is do you love you.

1299
02:19:02.550 --> 02:19:02.970
Melonie Powers: Wow.

1300
02:19:04.470 --> 02:19:13.560
Richelle Direny: And so that's where you have to start so on. So, oftentimes you seek it out from other people, but then no one will ever satisfy

1301
02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:30.330
Richelle Direny: That what you're missing on the inside because you have to, you have to identify what is it, what is it that you're not within you that you're not satisfied. No one will ever meet those expectations that you set for yourself. No one will ever meet it.

1302
02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.240
Melonie Powers: You know, so

1303
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:34.830
Melonie Powers: He goes in.

1304
02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:39.300
Melonie Powers: Myself. Well, first of all, isolate yourself. But then, secondly, you know, it can be

1305
02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:44.310
Melonie Powers: You know, just reinforce that whole

1306
02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:46.800
Melonie Powers: Thing.

1307
02:19:47.010 --> 02:19:48.900
Richelle Direny: But then I remember you saying that I think

1308
02:19:50.370 --> 02:19:55.740
Richelle Direny: Yes, and I think you said that you had. What is it your first husband that was very, very abusive.

1309
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:59.490
Melonie Powers: Oh, yeah.

1310
02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:00.630
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

1311
02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:05.880
Melonie Powers: But before your mobile phone, her husband was, Hey, I got married. Once in Las Vegas.

1312
02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:26.040
Melonie Powers: I got married one day is that guy left him well. But my first time when I left him while he's in the shower so afraid of them I was may, of course, a senior, I was gonna you had any inclination. I was gonna leave you know the car keys on all that but I spent my kids.

1313
02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:30.690
Melonie Powers: My mom's and I planned the whole thing. And he got shower, I

1314
02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:32.790
Melonie Powers: Took it

1315
02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:36.270
Melonie Powers: All

1316
02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:53.190
Melonie Powers: And then that's a met Daniel. So my second husband, the one that full 15 years in the world. You know, I met him while I was still married and running from the first

1317
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.040
Richelle Direny: Literally run

1318
02:20:57.210 --> 02:20:59.580
Richelle Direny: So what abandoned know where I was.

1319
02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:02.700
Richelle Direny: So what about you, what is the

1320
02:21:02.850 --> 02:21:03.930
Richelle Direny: What was the relationship

1321
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:05.040
With your father.

1322
02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:10.860
Melonie Powers: Well,

1323
02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:25.710
Melonie Powers: It is this pretty much me trying to say what is, you know, my mother, I left a third story about being window out of an apartment into, like, eight months pregnant with me. He

1324
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:39.120
Melonie Powers: Sent my sister author, he, he and my sister birthday is it my Otter cars and I got nothing from that man. And then when he got, you know, cancer.

1325
02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:41.730
Melonie Powers: Lung cancer, you know,

1326
02:21:43.170 --> 02:22:01.590
Melonie Powers: He tried to come to Colorado and a piece and I tried to do that because that wasn't a relationship. I never was. So when I say that my dad, you know, I'm talking about my mom has been with us. And what about 11 and a half years old he's he's

1327
02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:03.840
Richelle Direny: My window and

1328
02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.740
Melonie Powers: Yeah. So when I talk when I say my dad right now. I'm always talking about my stuff, Dad.

1329
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:17.190
Melonie Powers: That then there. Yeah, I mean, I'm not talking about my real father, he said.

1330
02:22:18.270 --> 02:22:22.590
Richelle Direny: Okay. But then your step that the relationship with your step dad was really good.

1331
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:30.660
Melonie Powers: Know, because you can't meet that man and you can never do anything right for him and

1332
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:33.630
Melonie Powers: Nothing ever good enough.

1333
02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:37.140
Melonie Powers: Laughing I do it.

1334
02:22:37.410 --> 02:22:46.500
Richelle Direny: Comes down to the struggles that you have with men all stem from the main men in your life.

1335
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:51.420
Richelle Direny: And the main men that were in your life or your biological

1336
02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:57.150
Richelle Direny: Father and Your stepfather. They those main individual that was supposed to

1337
02:22:58.470 --> 02:23:04.080
Richelle Direny: Pretty much set the stage for you in terms of what you desire.

1338
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.640
Richelle Direny: In men, how, how

1339
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:10.710
Richelle Direny: To judge the characteristic of a quality.

1340
02:23:12.210 --> 02:23:24.930
Richelle Direny: Man who loves and support his wife and his family. It's what you got, growing up was not a very good example of that so often time the love that you're looking for.

1341
02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:41.400
Richelle Direny: Through these and I think we've talked about this in the past through all of these relationships that you've been in lately is a little girl inside of you that was looking for for it from her father her biological father or the men that were in her life when she was growing up.

1342
02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:48.390
Richelle Direny: I mean, that's why it's important to have a mom and a dad because they each teach you something different.

1343
02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:51.630
Richelle Direny: They each teach you how to

1344
02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:53.580
Melonie Powers: Love, how to respect how to

1345
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:58.470
Richelle Direny: Value yourself different ways from two different perspective. But your father.

1346
02:23:59.550 --> 02:24:17.940
Richelle Direny: Really teaches you you know the expectations that you have of men in your life comes really from your dad. And if that was distorted from day one. Ultimately, what will happen in all of the relationships that you're in. So you're you're seeking

1347
02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:21.750
Richelle Direny: The type of loving affection or attention.

1348
02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:37.980
Richelle Direny: Based on what you're desiring from your biological from one your biological or your stepfather, whoever those men were in your life growing up and they based on what you're saying. Pretty banged up job.

1349
02:24:38.430 --> 02:24:40.710
Richelle Direny: wasn't that good. Yeah.

1350
02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:41.910
Richelle Direny: So that's why

1351
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:47.250
Melonie Powers: And then you know my that was this fog that dad was my

1352
02:24:48.630 --> 02:25:00.450
Melonie Powers: Dad, my mom and now she's been married for over 25 years. But my point being is she got married five times that doesn't even include you know

1353
02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.550
Melonie Powers: But I mean, I see where she was trying to take

1354
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:13.860
Melonie Powers: Care two girls and she's looking for somebody to help her be here.

1355
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:15.840
Richelle Direny: To help her.

1356
02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:20.490
Melonie Powers: And to help us, you know, stable.

1357
02:25:21.210 --> 02:25:35.460
Richelle Direny: So basically what you learnt from your so big it sounds as based on what you're saying what you're doing now is pretty much what your mom taught you how to do just stay secure and

1358
02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:38.760
Richelle Direny: Instead of demanding.

1359
02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:46.170
Richelle Direny: The respects the love and attention that you know that you're worthy of you.

1360
02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:56.250
Richelle Direny: You tend to settle for whatever because as long as you have some type of security net, which is a false sense of security net

1361
02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:06.960
Richelle Direny: You you tell yourself. It's okay. It goes back to that word you used earlier, you just get over it because you just say you justified in your head that it's okay.

1362
02:26:07.530 --> 02:26:15.990
Richelle Direny: Because I have a roof over my head. I have this and I have that it's okay you're miserable on the inside, but you in your mind.

1363
02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:29.640
Richelle Direny: You justify it, and you can you tell yourself so it's okay. So you've perfected the art of doing that for many years and based on what you're seeing your mom did through all of her relationships. She taught you to accept it.

1364
02:26:30.690 --> 02:26:41.550
Richelle Direny: Without not necessarily saying mom Melanie accepted but her actions taught you. We are a product of our parents.

1365
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:45.930
Richelle Direny: Were a product of the adults that we're setting our lives.

1366
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:51.120
Melonie Powers: Well,

1367
02:26:53.250 --> 02:26:53.730
Hmm.

1368
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:55.500
Melonie Powers: I think

1369
02:26:56.610 --> 02:27:05.850
Richelle Direny: You can't change it, but you can become aware of it. And with that awareness and knowledge and education. You can work to change you.

1370
02:27:06.930 --> 02:27:14.610
Richelle Direny: Mean you can work to change to to pretty much let that little girl inside grow up to love.

1371
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:17.910
Richelle Direny: The person who who she is today.

1372
02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:24.930
Melonie Powers: I'm a firm believer and you can't change.

1373
02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:30.360
Melonie Powers: You said that you can you are

1374
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:49.320
Richelle Direny: You Are you who you who you are, who you are. Now, but you can love the person that you are today with all of the imperfections and everything you can learn to love except the person who you are today. Love that individual and work on

1375
02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.550
Richelle Direny: Pretty much making better choices.

1376
02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:58.410
Richelle Direny: Like I said, ultimately, loving the who you are right now.

1377
02:28:06.090 --> 02:28:10.770
Richelle Direny: That's something that you struggle with. And I, and I wonder if it's just

1378
02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:17.880
Richelle Direny: you struggle with it because you fear what that might feel like

1379
02:28:23.250 --> 02:28:23.820
Melonie Powers: I don't know.

1380
02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:33.000
Richelle Direny: Then the question is do you fear what that might feel like to authentically love the who you are right now.

1381
02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.920
Melonie Powers: I don't know what I don't like to talk about, because I just cry.

1382
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:43.080
Richelle Direny: It's okay to cry.

1383
02:28:44.490 --> 02:28:45.000
Melonie Powers: When I

1384
02:28:46.410 --> 02:28:48.360
Melonie Powers: Was a story of my life.

1385
02:28:51.960 --> 02:29:01.680
Richelle Direny: But it's okay to cry. It's there's nothing wrong with crying crying is a natural reaction to different emotions that comes along.

1386
02:29:03.210 --> 02:29:07.890
Melonie Powers: But the question is do but otherwise I'm always hockey.

1387
02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:11.670
Melonie Powers: Oh,

1388
02:29:14.310 --> 02:29:15.510
Melonie Powers: Oh popped up in

1389
02:29:17.730 --> 02:29:18.090
Melonie Powers: My

1390
02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:26.130
Melonie Powers: Region one, it should be done. Yeah, I think straight my head.

1391
02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:30.450
Melonie Powers: Of those after

1392
02:29:31.050 --> 02:29:48.330
Richelle Direny: But then to. Okay, so with everything that you said just now, how about trying to say to switch that somewhat negative thought process and just tell yourself something positive, that I am not who I think I am.

1393
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:53.490
Richelle Direny: I am and fill in those blanks which something positive.

1394
02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:55.050
Richelle Direny: You have

1395
02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:56.790
Richelle Direny: It's basically you're tricking your mind.

1396
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:57.480
Long

1397
02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:14.340
Richelle Direny: Debate. But again, it goes back to that negative thought process is switching it to something positive, you have to because you have negatively spoken to yourself for so many years that that's what feels comfortable

1398
02:30:15.930 --> 02:30:23.190
Richelle Direny: So to do anything else. You're going to feel like it's alive because you have taught yourself to think the way you think.

1399
02:30:23.970 --> 02:30:39.420
Richelle Direny: So now you have to force it to change it to what you want. I am not who I think I am this and then fill in the blank. I am beautiful, I love who I am.

1400
02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:45.720
Richelle Direny: You just said. Remember, you just said you learn that you have to change your thought process.

1401
02:30:46.050 --> 02:31:03.780
Richelle Direny: On how you look at yourself. And that's how you started gaining you said I can't keep wearing the same makeup, as I did when I was in my 20s, I have to change my thought process. And I have to do things a little bit differently. So taking that same concept and applying it to now.

1402
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:07.770
Richelle Direny: Your inner you know self. Why is that part so hard.

1403
02:31:13.170 --> 02:31:14.970
Melonie Powers: I don't even want don't

1404
02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:18.390
Melonie Powers: I don't, I'm not, you know,

1405
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.540
Melonie Powers: I can't do it.

1406
02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:23.700
Richelle Direny: Do you fear loving you

1407
02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:27.900
Melonie Powers: Know,

1408
02:31:28.350 --> 02:31:29.550
Richelle Direny: Do you fear happiness.

1409
02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:31.890
Richelle Direny: Happiness.

1410
02:31:34.350 --> 02:31:36.270
Melonie Powers: I don't think I know what that really is.

1411
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:39.090
Richelle Direny: Okay, tell me.

1412
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:41.010
Richelle Direny: Think about it for just one second.

1413
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:44.550
Melonie Powers: books I've read a million books, but

1414
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:49.920
Richelle Direny: Well clearly books ain't really your you are, where you are right now. So the question is,

1415
02:31:51.150 --> 02:32:05.340
Richelle Direny: Tell me a time in your life that you can remember that whether it lasted for 10 minutes or an hour, tell me a time in your life that you experience true happiness. Happiness that you have never experienced before. Tell me a time when you did.

1416
02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.490
Melonie Powers: You maybe ever

1417
02:32:16.350 --> 02:32:17.190
Melonie Powers: Even none.

1418
02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:18.630
Richelle Direny: No, no.

1419
02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:27.030
Richelle Direny: I don't want you to go any further with it. What about you have to explain to me that degree of happiness. Like when you had your child.

1420
02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.490
Richelle Direny: Explain that to me.

1421
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:33.480
Melonie Powers: All you know

1422
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:38.670
Melonie Powers: 1516. What was that, oh yeah.

1423
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:47.220
Richelle Direny: It doesn't matter if you had anything. It doesn't matter. You said in that. I don't care. Even if you had a 10. I don't care what age you had a man

1424
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:51.870
Richelle Direny: I'm not looking at all of the negative things surrounding you getting pregnant and giving

1425
02:32:52.320 --> 02:33:08.550
Richelle Direny: I'm talking about the emotion. If you're saying that giving birth to this child then putting this child in your hand. I want you to tell me if that was the happiest time in your life, even if it only lasted for an hour, what did that feel like

1426
02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:15.300
Melonie Powers: No, no.

1427
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:18.090
You just told me

1428
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:24.150
Like a

1429
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:29.070
Melonie Powers: You know,

1430
02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:40.620
Melonie Powers: That you know having like a crutch.

1431
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:47.250
Melonie Powers: Is like having like a crutch.

1432
02:33:48.450 --> 02:33:48.870
Melonie Powers: No.

1433
02:33:51.210 --> 02:33:53.550
Melonie Powers: No, no relationship with my daughter know

1434
02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:11.070
Richelle Direny: You see what you do, you've trained yourself you have perfected the ability to only think of negative things that it is very, very, very, very, very hard. So even to try and do anything positive

1435
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:23.490
Richelle Direny: It is very difficult because oh no no we're not gonna talk about that. Let's talk about something negative. Okay. But then what about this moment. Oh, no, no. Let's talk about that. Let's go to the negative

1436
02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:28.350
Richelle Direny: It's like, it's that it's just that hard for you because you've trained yourself.

1437
02:34:30.210 --> 02:34:34.770
Melonie Powers: you've trained yourself, but it's just all turned out bad

1438
02:34:36.270 --> 02:34:37.140
Richelle Direny: Because it's how

1439
02:34:37.170 --> 02:34:38.310
Melonie Powers: It's how you go

1440
02:34:38.310 --> 02:34:38.880
Richelle Direny: About her

1441
02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:54.000
Richelle Direny: It's how you go about it. It's how you look at it it's it's when it's all said and done, it's a choice. It's a choice. We're making the I'm not telling you that life doesn't have it up its ups and downs. I'm not telling you that life.

1442
02:34:56.580 --> 02:35:02.610
Richelle Direny: Or not gonna throw you a whole lot of curveballs I'm not gonna tell you that I'll be lying if I tell you that

1443
02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:11.550
Richelle Direny: But at the same time. Life has also thrown us a whole lot of good news. It's up to us what we want to say focus on

1444
02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:23.670
Richelle Direny: So the depth our of our depression all comes down to what are you saying focus on just the walls of life.

1445
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:28.530
Richelle Direny: I mean, everything is any emotion that comes and goes.

1446
02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:32.760
Richelle Direny: What do you want to stay focus on what do you want to enjoy.

1447
02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:42.660
Richelle Direny: So that's what it comes down to. And honestly, Melanie, I think you're really truly do want to

1448
02:35:43.890 --> 02:35:45.840
Richelle Direny: I think it's just very hard for you.

1449
02:35:50.490 --> 02:35:55.620
Richelle Direny: It's just, it's very, very hard for you and you know it's you have to just

1450
02:35:57.300 --> 02:35:58.920
Richelle Direny: You have to answer that question.

1451
02:36:00.210 --> 02:36:02.970
Richelle Direny: It just start with just one day, even if you feel like it's a lie.

1452
02:36:04.410 --> 02:36:06.990
Richelle Direny: Tell yourself that lie long enough you start believing in

Richelle Direny: So everybody's working from home, I'm working from home. My husband is working from home. The kids are schooling from home.

1548
02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:35.100
Richelle Direny: So you have to find different areas.

1549
02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:40.680
Brock Simmons: To do every certainly become a scary thing here where I live. I live in Ohio and

1550
02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:53.040
Brock Simmons: It's like everybody's not working and going to school, but they have me working in a factory and and have some working at Walmart and it's like, what do you do continue to go to work and provide for the family or

1551
02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:58.470
Brock Simmons: You know, quit. We're taking a risk on getting it. I mean, it's scary. It's a scary thing.

1552
02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:12.750
Richelle Direny: It is, it is. I mean, the thing is, so like for me. They so for like today's my first day working from home. And at first, you know, cuz I work for

1553
02:44:13.950 --> 02:44:22.830
Richelle Direny: A contractor with the VA. So they tell you you're an essential worker, and then I'm thinking, well, I mean, I'm in the central worker and they said

1554
02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:32.190
Richelle Direny: Central. So, but then I mean, but for what I is that I do as a

1555
02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:45.360
Richelle Direny: Case Manager is what they call with this what I do. It's for what I do, I could do it all on from home. I don't have to be in the office where it's different from like a doctor and a nurse, like they have to be there.

1556
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:49.410
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah, it's a little bit. It's a little bit different but

1557
02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.480
Richelle Direny: I mean, listen, I appreciate your son going to Walmart because you know you run out of food.

1558
02:44:55.740 --> 02:44:56.250
Brock Simmons: Yeah.

1559
02:44:56.760 --> 02:44:58.410
Richelle Direny: You know, it's like going down.

1560
02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:09.060
Brock Simmons: Yeah, no shit. Yeah, it's just very because he can bring it home to us. And I don't know, I could bring it home. We're both in and out all day so I don't want to hear what

1561
02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:09.480
Richelle Direny: Is your

1562
02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:19.260
Richelle Direny: What is the protocol that you have in place both of you have in place for yourselves in terms of when you go to work. Like, what are the protective things

1563
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:31.230
Brock Simmons: Well, really, we as we take our coach and stuff off i were to explain layers of clothes I wear thermals under my pants because factories little cold, so I'll take them off before I come in the door.

1564
02:45:31.890 --> 02:45:41.460
Brock Simmons: But really we don't even have or in all reality. I mean, David takes his best and stuff off and Washington his hands, and we had hand sanitizer, which we're about to run out.

1565
02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:48.780
Brock Simmons: And I don't even know where are you going to order it online, I guess, cuz none of the stores here carrion, they're all sold out.

1566
02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:52.290
Richelle Direny: But in Walmart, they have on like what time does he go to work.

1567
02:45:53.340 --> 02:46:00.660
Brock Simmons: He goes to work. It's different Z to go to work. I knew one day and six. The next day, so it's just four or five hours at a time.

1568
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:15.060
Richelle Direny: Oh, and I because I was thinking a lot of i would i would think that workers have like the stores like grocery stores in different places of that sort. When the shipment comes in. They first

1569
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:24.630
Richelle Direny: You know, like they know when the shipment comes in. So all of these items like a session items that you would need. You would think that they get first dibs at it because

1570
02:46:25.050 --> 02:46:33.420
Brock Simmons: Well, they're telling David my son at Walmart is no longer going to get hand sanitizers or the mask or the done, getting them.

1571
02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:41.430
Brock Simmons: Some about the medical teams and the medical profession. I don't know what's going on. So they're not getting any more at all.

1572
02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:42.750
Brock Simmons: For the time being.

1573
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:51.690
Richelle Direny: You know what was interesting. I thought this was very interesting, actually. Yesterday, you know, so I don't know if you have

1574
02:46:53.340 --> 02:47:05.070
Richelle Direny: I use this quote this app called WhatsApp and they they are or even like on social media to I don't have social media, but I get it. People get it from social media and send it to this one that I have and

1575
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:20.340
Richelle Direny: You have these different like means that's going around or these little video clips that they send around or what have you. Yesterday I thought was very interesting that I never even thought of what is the the main ingredient in a hand sanitizer.

1576
02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:25.230
Brock Simmons: Oh, you get rubbing alcohol and then you. Right, right. We can't

1577
02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:29.880
Brock Simmons: We can't find alcohol anywhere. Neither Robin

1578
02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:51.030
Richelle Direny: The but this is the thing. This was what was interesting. It was this doctor he took the hand sanitizer. He pumped. Some of it in a plate. He clean the plate. He pumps. Some of the hand sanitizer in the plate. And he said, and he liked the the hand sanitizer on fire. Like he put fire to it.

1579
02:47:51.570 --> 02:48:03.840
Richelle Direny: And it plays it didn't. You didn't see any fire, either it just so. Okay. What happened to the fire, he went and got a piece of napkin. He put it over the hand sanitizer. And what do you think happened to the hand sanitizer.

1580
02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:05.610
Brock Simmons: lit up.

1581
02:48:06.690 --> 02:48:07.080
Richelle Direny: Fire

1582
02:48:07.530 --> 02:48:08.160
Brock Simmons: Really

1583
02:48:08.670 --> 02:48:17.580
Richelle Direny: caught fire. And so he said, you know, you have to be careful because the hand sanitizer. The one that he had it said it had 70% alcohol in it.

1584
02:48:18.390 --> 02:48:26.850
Richelle Direny: Well, he went back, you're thinking like, okay, maybe it died down. He went back like a few minutes later, put the paper towel over the hand sanitizer. And what happened.

1585
02:48:27.270 --> 02:48:28.290
Brock Simmons: Fire again.

1586
02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:35.820
Richelle Direny: caught fire again. And he was like, they never really showed like how he was able to like how he got rid of it, like whether he washed it off or what

1587
02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:45.510
Richelle Direny: But he was like, you know, one of the points he made. He said, You have to be careful at home with this stuff because this stuff he I guess he was cautioning not to really use it or you so much of it at home.

1588
02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:55.950
Richelle Direny: Because of the fact of the alcohol content in it. If you're using it at home and then you go over the stove or you go with your you could easily get burnt because of the alcohol in it.

1589
02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:57.900
Brock Simmons: Yeah, we've

1590
02:48:58.950 --> 02:49:10.080
Brock Simmons: We watch all kinds of stuff like that on TV. I don't know. I hope this stuff passes before too long, and we can get back to our normal everyday lives because it's just this stressful. What is

1591
02:49:10.890 --> 02:49:14.940
Richelle Direny: It if I most definitely it really truly is.

1592
02:49:15.270 --> 02:49:15.900
Brock Simmons: Yeah.

1593
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:18.210

1596
02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:27.240

1597
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:33.390
Brock Simmons: Well, I have to. I'm left in the house to I'm scrolling around, around, but it's still yeah you worried about them and just

1598
02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:42.420
Brock Simmons: I don't know, my wife's just out too much. I kind of do too. I'm fine until I watched the news as soon as I watched the news and I stopped paying a cannon.

1599
02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:44.250
Richelle Direny: What you need to do you need to know.

1600
02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:55.680
Brock Simmons: What so much. I try to stay on as much as possible, but I like to know what's going on at the same time, I want to know, you know, we're in a hot zone you live in Florida. Right. Correct.

1601
02:49:56.550 --> 02:49:57.870
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, it's one of those

1602
02:49:58.590 --> 02:50:02.670
Richelle Direny: And then in the county. I'm leaving. I live in May.

1603
02:50:04.170 --> 02:50:11.610
Richelle Direny: One minute. It's like, you know, 1000 people then next minute it like it jumps. A shoots up. You're like, What the heck, or did all this

1604
02:50:14.730 --> 02:50:15.120
Richelle Direny: High

1605
02:50:16.050 --> 02:50:20.100
Brock Simmons: Here we only have 10 confirmed cases, but we have numerous

1606
02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:36.180
Brock Simmons: And we have turned us as what it is we have numerous cases of it, but I don't know what to think. Who knows if we're getting told the truth. You know what I mean, no can be all kinds of different theories on what the hell's really going on. So very weird. I don't know.

1607
02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:38.850
And

1608
02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:45.240
Richelle Direny: The part of me kind of uses that took to ease my mind because if you question.

1609
02:50:45.870 --> 02:50:46.890
Richelle Direny: Yeah, how much is this

1610
02:50:47.970 --> 02:50:53.820
Richelle Direny: really true that that you're going to be unwise and you're going to go out there and do something really silly.

1611
02:50:54.300 --> 02:50:57.570
Richelle Direny: But at the same time you question.

1612
02:50:58.230 --> 02:51:10.530
Brock Simmons: Yeah, it's a we only watch Fox eight News. Now, or MSNBC because there's just so much fake propaganda ship going around it. It's really scary. I mean, it's like what the world so

1613
02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:12.780
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's a little. It's a little

1614
02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:19.890
Richelle Direny: It's a little. Some of it is a little suspicious. Like, how does this thing spreading so quickly and how

1615
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:33.150
Brock Simmons: Did this. It's like this is, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. How's your drinking water where you're at. You guys and cotton, not for a lot of Dell thing. Are you over everybody's water is contaminated and stuff like that.

1617
02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:46.890
Brock Simmons: Yeah, Fort Lauderdale, something happened with the water system. I guess the whole city is contaminated water and all kinds of stuff.

1618
02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:51.630
Brock Simmons: I got it bro is in Fort Lauderdale. That's why I was asking you.

1621
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:59.760
Richelle Direny: I think remember Fort Lauderdale is

1622
02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:00.810
Richelle Direny: A

1623
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:03.150
Richelle Direny: City in Broward County.

1625
02:52:06.270 --> 02:52:13.260
Brock Simmons: Right, right. I guess I'm not, for sure. I just seen it this morning. So I just figured I'd ask you, I don't have any facts on it right now.

1630
02:52:33.210 --> 02:52:46.890
Brock Simmons: I haven't. We've always used bottle water and stuff like that. Just because Detroit. I mean have two states away from us and they had the worst wider than the United States, and we can't stay away from metric and shooting.

1655
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:46.050
Richelle Direny: So you go you work tonight.

1656
02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:49.530
Brock Simmons: Yeah, yeah, this is my day back, I gotta go back tonight.

1657
02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:55.500
Richelle Direny: Okay, but do you like how your house is set up. Do you guys have garages there in Ohio.

1658
02:54:56.580 --> 02:54:57.450
Brock Simmons: garages.

1659
02:54:57.960 --> 02:54:59.430
Richelle Direny: They like we have a garage.

1660
02:54:59.610 --> 02:55:01.650
Brock Simmons: Yeah, that's where we are.

1661
02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:06.300
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you undress from the garage and then come in the house.

1662
02:55:06.690 --> 02:55:07.680
Brock Simmons: House. Yeah.

1663
02:55:08.310 --> 02:55:11.820
Richelle Direny: Okay. Oh. Is your. Do you have washer and dryer. Yeah.

1664
02:55:11.850 --> 02:55:15.360
Brock Simmons: Right in the garage about setup in the garage. So that's fine. Yeah.

1665
02:55:16.170 --> 02:55:26.490
Richelle Direny: And that's just kind of how it is, you know, you just wash your hands and then come in the house. And I mean, listen, at the end of the day, I think a lot of this. It drives a lot of fearing people

1666
02:55:28.020 --> 02:55:35.760
Richelle Direny: It's a test of your faith and it also you know a lot of people are losing hope, especially when you watch the news, like you said,

1667
02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:41.430
Richelle Direny: And you're hearing about so many people dying like almost in a you're comparing it

1668
02:55:41.730 --> 02:55:50.220
Richelle Direny: To Italy and when they make these comparisons from how many people died in China in comparison to Italy and now here in the United States. When you hear, stuff like that.

1669
02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:59.730
Richelle Direny: And then you start showing people all look now we're kind of getting up there in numbers with Italy. Oh, now with the past, Italy, what do you think happens to everyone.

1670
02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:01.530
Brock Simmons: start freaking out.

1671
02:56:02.010 --> 02:56:04.260
Richelle Direny: If you're depressed, what happens to your depression.

1672
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:05.370
Brock Simmons: Right.

1673
02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:18.960
Richelle Direny: Now you're deep in it so y'all. And it's so there's so much that can come out of it. So like you said, which is important is for you to be aware of those things that increases your anxiety.

1674
02:56:19.290 --> 02:56:29.670
Richelle Direny: Right. It is not something you struggle with. You're definitely you're going to start having, you know, increasing anxiety and struggling with it, simply because of what you're

1675
02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:33.030
Richelle Direny: What you're feeding your mind with

1676
02:56:33.450 --> 02:56:40.470
Brock Simmons: Right. See, my wife has extremely high blood pressure on me. They fall in Sedona news that coronavirus will

1677
02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:52.560
Brock Simmons: That's the first place that attacks its blood pressure and stuff like that. So that's another reason why we worry a lot scared as she might attract it and then a federal blood pressure taken

1678
02:56:54.750 --> 02:57:08.490
Brock Simmons: A night here lately. No, but she used to go shopping. She likes to go to the stores and do all that. But no. Not lately. She's trying to depress right now because she can't get a house. She stopped in the house, but rather be safe than sorry. So you'd

1679
02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:29.400
Richelle Direny: rather be safe than sorry. But at the same time, when you get over. So remember, so it's not just about the okay am I wearing all of these personal protective devices, honestly, what they're not telling you is that you are also weakening your own defense system when you get super stress.

1680
02:57:29.910 --> 02:57:31.770
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah, absolutely.

1681
02:57:32.190 --> 02:57:39.810
Richelle Direny: But nobody could test for that nobody is that gonna, I'm sure they're in there. They're never going to tell you that, but if you you're waking you're weakening your defense system.

1682
02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:52.320
Richelle Direny: When you get so stress you all of these different chemicals are released into your body and it weakens your defense system. It's kind of like the concept of

1683
02:57:53.010 --> 02:57:59.370
Richelle Direny: Um, when you want like they tell you wash your hands every 20 minutes. What do you think is going to happen when you wash your hand that much.

1684
02:58:00.930 --> 02:58:02.940
Brock Simmons: What's that you wash your hands.

1685
02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:07.320
Richelle Direny: They tell you to wash your hands when especially when you're out every 20 minutes

1686
02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:08.250
Right.

1687
02:58:10.260 --> 02:58:13.740
Richelle Direny: How many times a day, are you washing your hands if you wash it. Every 20 minutes

1688
02:58:14.130 --> 02:58:23.400
Brock Simmons: Should quite, quite a few. Yes. Three times an hour. So I'm moving around 10 to 12 hours a day. So that's 3040 times at least

1689
02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:31.200
Richelle Direny: So what do you think you're doing to your natural the natural for the natural bacteria that your body needs to protect you.

1690
02:58:31.230 --> 02:58:32.130
Brock Simmons: But I'm not

1691
02:58:32.670 --> 02:58:35.400
Brock Simmons: pro choice Pro. Yeah, yeah.

1692
02:58:36.570 --> 02:58:44.970
Richelle Direny: So one way you. Okay, so I'm going to unlock the door to my immune system by getting super stress from watching this news.

1693
02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:45.900
Brock Simmons: Right, that's

1694
02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:57.870
Richelle Direny: gonna follow everything they say I'm going to watch the crap out of my hands and probably go baby three, four times a day. And so all of what you're doing now, you're just opening up yourself.

1695
02:58:58.830 --> 02:59:08.820
Brock Simmons: Right. That's a good, that's a good point that you just said, yeah, I never thought of that we ought to Washington and use my hand sanitizer. How many times a day. I mean, I know I use at least 10 times

1696
02:59:09.090 --> 02:59:16.110
Richelle Direny: What do you know what do you know, one of the one of the, one of the things that alcohol does to you when you use it. What do you think it does.

1697
02:59:17.250 --> 02:59:21.210
Brock Simmons: Well as obviously gets you dilute it gets you drunk when are you upset.

1698
02:59:22.590 --> 02:59:24.420
Richelle Direny: But doesn't it. It's a drying agent.

1699
02:59:24.900 --> 02:59:27.750
Brock Simmons: Right, well yeah dry shout at me. Yeah, absolutely.

1700
02:59:28.350 --> 02:59:33.570
Richelle Direny: So if you're using nothing all day long on your hand. What do you think you're doing to at least your hands.

1701
02:59:34.650 --> 02:59:38.310
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah, it's a that's a good point. I like

1702
02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:50.940
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, again, you are going to use the precautions that are put out there, but you are not going to be unwise and you're not going to overdo it now. Now your wife has

1703
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:55.620
Richelle Direny: High blood pressure right she has high blood pressure. So she's supposed to take her medication.

1704
02:59:56.010 --> 03:00:00.870
Richelle Direny: Yeah, she gets stress can you control your high blood pressure.

1705
03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:08.670
Brock Simmons: I know she's got she got to watch. What about getting stressed out stuff all the time because it affects yeah

1706
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:22.350
Richelle Direny: If your body is under stress. I don't care how much blood pressure pills you drink it is not going to you're going to keep taking it. Otherwise my blood pressure not going well, why don't you call me so down

1707
03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:24.480
Brock Simmons: Right.

1708
03:00:25.770 --> 03:00:30.330
Brock Simmons: Yes, everything, but we're getting less stress.

1709
03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:41.400
Richelle Direny: Worry and stress as a whole lot of things to your body that no one can test for no one not there is no MRI. There's no EKG. There's no blood tests. There's no all of these sophisticated tests.

1710
03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:48.930
Richelle Direny: Can stress test for stress. That is why, especially with children, mostly with children. I've ever heard.

1711
03:00:49.230 --> 03:01:06.900
Richelle Direny: That when you take a child to the doctor. They one of the number one questions that they asked, Has there been any changes disruption in this child's life meaning that mom and dad or siblings are every. Is everybody still in the picture. Has anything changed within the family context.

1712
03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:09.510
Brock Simmons: Right. That's why they asked. Yeah.

1713
03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:22.680
Richelle Direny: That's why they asked because of the emotional and mental impact it has on this child how this child stress level. And how do you know when your child is super stressed was one indicator that you know that something is going on with your child.

1714
03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:28.410
Brock Simmons: Right. And then once the damage is done. There's no 15 others know the damage it.

1715
03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:32.340
Richelle Direny: But it's very hard to fix it when you can't even identify it.

1716
03:01:32.730 --> 03:01:33.960
Brock Simmons: Because, you know,

1717
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:40.920
Richelle Direny: The one thing that you can tell when a child is over the stress is their behavior. That's the first indicator that there is something wrong.

1718
03:01:41.220 --> 03:01:42.930
Brock Simmons: Because acting out

1719
03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:56.430
Richelle Direny: And naturally, we don't stop to say hey you know what something changed something happened and maybe that's the reason why this child is acting like that. No you jump to disciplining. So what do we do as an as as human beings.

1720
03:01:56.910 --> 03:02:15.990
Richelle Direny: We completely become so evasive of the different life changes that we go through so it goes back to like with your wife, you're still going to follow through on whatever precautions that's put out there, you're going to practice natural hand hygiene, that you should have been doing anyway.

1721
03:02:19.020 --> 03:02:27.210
Richelle Direny: Like it's like your dentist calling you and saying, oh, now we're cleaning out everything. Hold up. So every time when I was coming here last month. She wasn't feeling in it.

1722
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:37.830
Brock Simmons: Yeah, it's just it's common sense, really. I mean, the stuff that we've been doing. We've been told to do for forever now and now everybody now wants to do it so it's

1723
03:02:39.330 --> 03:02:47.070
Brock Simmons: I don't know, I just like to know the truth of fish really the truth about this whole ordeal is something more sinister going on. I mean, it's just

1724
03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:59.310
Brock Simmons: Always that in the back of my head. So my dad was a big conspiracy theorists kind of guy. So I try to stay away from all that stuff. But at the same time, it makes you wonder, you know, what is really going on. So,

1725
03:03:00.810 --> 03:03:03.840
Richelle Direny: Nothing. Listen, I'm gonna tell you this Brock

1726
03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:06.300
Richelle Direny: We are called a session that will tell you.

1727
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:09.240
Brock Simmons: Know conspiracy theorists.

1728
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:14.970
Richelle Direny: Conspiracy theorists, I'ma say, sometimes it makes you

1729
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:17.760
Brock Simmons: Yeah. Does it really does.

1730
03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:21.900
Brock Simmons: Thank you froze up on me.

1731
03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:23.910
