1
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.799
Gordan Ortega: SOUND Yes.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.269
Dawn Abriel: Okay, great. I'm Dr. Bob reality and you're Gordon nice to

3
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.609
Dawn Abriel: Let me just get your page appear on my computer.

4
00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.680
Gordan Ortega: And

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
Dawn Abriel: We can begin the first thing I need to know

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.040
Dawn Abriel: Is the last time you had any kind of opioid

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.650
Gordan Ortega: On moment.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.620
Gordan Ortega: It was last Friday.

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.200
Dawn Abriel: And

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.130
Dawn Abriel: So you've so

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.230
Dawn Abriel: Like eight days ago.

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.310
Yes.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.700
Dawn Abriel: So how, what have you been doing

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.040
Gordan Ortega: Without the open

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.490
Dawn Abriel: So let me clear this up for you Suboxone is an opioid

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
Gordan Ortega: It's a long that an opioid this morning.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.290
Gordan Ortega: Okay, that's one

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.820
Dawn Abriel: And and how much

19
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.300
Gordan Ortega: I just had a maybe an eighth of a strip

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.630
Dawn Abriel: So one milligram

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.980
Yeah.

22
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:36.120
Dawn Abriel: Yeah so buprenorphine is a long acting opioid. And the reason it works for withdrawal and bringing people off of opioids is because while you're on the buprenorphine. You don't have to worry about.

23
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.400
Dawn Abriel: It so long acting, you can, you know, have a job and

24
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.110
Dawn Abriel: Just about. Yeah, it depends on the person, but between 24 and 36

25
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.910
Dawn Abriel: And

26
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.890
Dawn Abriel: So have you been doing that one milligram for the last eight days.

27
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.900
Gordan Ortega: Um,

28
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.520
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, more or less about strip is that to me the last eight days. Yeah, okay.

29
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.100
Dawn Abriel: Now that's different than an eighth of a strip is different than a whole strip

30
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.960
Gordan Ortega: I say this trip is last to me the last eight days right

31
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.820
Dawn Abriel: No.

32
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.570
Be

33
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.360
Dawn Abriel: So one strip is eight milligrams

34
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.450
Gordan Ortega: Understand, so if I break it up in a pieces and I take my eight days in a row. That's one strip in eight days.

35
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.950
Dawn Abriel: That's what I asked you. Okay.

36
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.430
Gordan Ortega: Yes.

37
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.700
Dawn Abriel: I thought you said you had a whole strip each day.

38
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.710
Gordan Ortega: Know, over the last 30 days.

39
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.180
Dawn Abriel: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.520
Dawn Abriel: And it's lasting.

41
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.680
Gordan Ortega: Taking two or three a day.

42
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.720
Gordan Ortega: On my scripts and I was just trying to

43
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.920
Gordan Ortega: Make it last so

44
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.520
Dawn Abriel: Right, yeah. So how long is that a strip lasting you

45
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
Gordan Ortega: It's lasted a week, only because I had prior to that, I was teaching

46
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.520
Gordan Ortega: You today and

47
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:19.020
Dawn Abriel: Gordon for some reason we're having trouble communicating, I must not be asking the questions correctly. I want to know how many hours after you take the eighth of the strip. Do you feel normal.

48
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.840
Gordan Ortega: Um,

49
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.740
Gordan Ortega: I guess maybe about

50
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.150
Gordan Ortega: Eight hours six hours. Okay. Okay.

51
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.540
Dawn Abriel: So that really helps me know what to start you want

52
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.470
Dawn Abriel: Um, so were you ever an IV drug user

53
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.200
Gordan Ortega: Yes, those two boxes I had were prescribing I was getting three a day and it just ran out.

54
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.930
Gordan Ortega: A week ago. And that's why I made the last one last like that they weren't something I bought off the street.

55
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.410
Dawn Abriel: Gotcha. So what you've done is you've made your body

56
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.700
Dawn Abriel: decrease the number of receptors.

57
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.030
Dawn Abriel: To take up dope.

58
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.710
Dawn Abriel: An opioid buprenorphine Knox's any of them heroin, you were, you were taking three a day you had many, many, many, many receptors.

59
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:32.250
Dawn Abriel: But because you came down, you now have very few receptors and that's why you can go that long without feeling

60
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.970
Dawn Abriel: In withdrawal. So that's good. I mean, you've really done yourself a huge favor actually

61
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.890
Dawn Abriel: Because

62
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.850
Dawn Abriel: Well, it's just, I mean if something should happen getting getting Suboxone

63
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:58.230
Dawn Abriel: Anywhere else and you had to pay cash being on, you know, a three quarters of a strip is a lot cheaper than being on three strips. Right.

64
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.790
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, definitely.

65
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:12.750
Dawn Abriel: So my most people build tolerance independence, they have to take more and more when they start out with either heroin or the prescription opioids. Was that true for you.

66
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.100
Yes.

67
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.820
Dawn Abriel: Any history of overdose.

68
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.130
Gordan Ortega: My

69
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.340
Gordan Ortega: Used opiates. For the last 12 years and it's only in the last year that I've overdose three time

70
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.600
Gordan Ortega: So yes, in the last year I overdose.

71
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.920
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, heroin and one time off of Naltrexone

72
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.330
Well,

73
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.980
Dawn Abriel: Don't understand know how you could overdose on Naltrexone

74
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.150
Gordan Ortega: Well, I had a counter reaction because I didn't have opiates out of my system long enough.

75
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.790
Gordan Ortega: And I ended up in the ICU.

76
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.530
Yeah.

77
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.690
Dawn Abriel: Okay, any legal issues related to your drug use.

78
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.830
Know,

79
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.650
Gordan Ortega: Are actually yes I have a possession charge and being in Santa Fe.

80
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.050
Dawn Abriel: And any other medical problems. Any abscesses, or heart infection or

81
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.160
Gordan Ortega: Because of the

82
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.180
Dawn Abriel: IV drug use.

83
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.270
Gordan Ortega: Um, I had another analysis, but I got it treated with this likely

84
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.880
Gordan Ortega: I do have bad anxiety usually

85
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:41.100
Gordan Ortega: I was getting Gavin paying for it for it, which is about to run out but prior to that my doctor was describing to me, I'll pass LM

86
00:06:42.030 --> 00:07:05.460
Gordan Ortega: One milligram tablets. But then I got on Gavin in hydrox Xen and tries to don't right now, which are all about to run out. So I don't know if I need to see a psychiatrist for that or what I need to do if I can use bright heart health in zoom for anxiety stuff to

87
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:22.920
Dawn Abriel: You know what you're signing up for what this program consists of is one hour of group therapy and that's with a doctor and a therapist and then one hour a week of individual therapy. So that's what this program is

88
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.340
Dawn Abriel: And you get your medicine.

89
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:38.100
Dawn Abriel: Depending on how easy it is for you to get a foothold. You know, to get established in the program. Some people have such a hard time that we have to write the prescription for

90
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:52.680
Dawn Abriel: The for just to get to the next appointment group to individual individual the group, group. Those are people who can't have a hard time keeping appointments and the only thing that gets them to us is the prescription

91
00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:01.020
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, this morning was a tough one because I went to bed late, but I made sure to get a sense yeah and and when

92
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.440
Dawn Abriel: When the sobriety when recoveries a priority. That's exactly what people do. So bravo.

93
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.770
Gordan Ortega: I already. For me, it's been hard to getting to

94
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.990
Gordan Ortega: I'm trying to get into residential treatment and whatnot at this place called oil recovery out of your local your local

95
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.000
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I'm in Santa Fe. Yeah, I know.

96
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.340
Dawn Abriel: It's just hard.

97
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.170
Dawn Abriel: We have solid people

98
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.160
Dawn Abriel: Needing treatment and we don't have enough places.

99
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:43.410
Gordan Ortega: And I don't know if the person that recommended me was really gave a high recommendation to the doctor that is in Santa Fe. I don't know if that's you, but her name is Melissa oil I got into the opioid outreach program.

100
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.490
Dawn Abriel: Yes, she was asking me just yesterday I talked to her.

101
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.930
Gordan Ortega: And she said, can

102
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:56.790
Dawn Abriel: I ask you, if my if my guy made it to you. And I said, well, I can't unless he signs are released. But if you tell me I can

103
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.370
Dawn Abriel: Okay, great.

104
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.640
Gordan Ortega: Yes, I guess I'm her first patient or first person to sign up with this and she was

105
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.310
Dawn Abriel: The first referral. Oh, that's super I'm tickled. It could be able to tell her.

106
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.700
Gordan Ortega: My dad's a retired firefighter in Santa Fe, so I

107
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:33.930
Gordan Ortega: Went over to the house and he gave me her number. And like I said, it's been a couple months now that I've been trying to get in somewhere and we, I have a meeting with oil on the 25th to the cloud with a meme. Surely, and I've been calling every day, just in case somebody leaves and

108
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.300
Gordan Ortega: I'm hoping to get into the residential program is kind of me with my

109
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.710
Gordan Ortega: Legal issues and let them know that I'm in treatment and

110
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:52.710
Gordan Ortega: Kind of just give me a more of a structured environment to give me more clean I'm under my belt and whatnot.

111
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:01.410
Dawn Abriel: Meanwhile, you can be in great heart health. You can go to lie and you can come back to bright heart health for the continuing care.

112
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:09.180
Gordan Ortega: Exactly. No, I really liked the idea of elements without a trance without my own vehicle and stuff is the most convenient.

113
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:25.110
Gordan Ortega: You bet. You know what I mean. My mom said she could help you if and when I get a prescription or whatnot, or I take the bus that's not a problem. I have my insurance and everything. And luckily, my Medicaid cover this happy to help.

114
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.550
Dawn Abriel: Yeah and you know people

115
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.820
Dawn Abriel: Don't realize that this

116
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.420
Dawn Abriel: That if if they take Medicaid away for addiction.

117
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.480
Dawn Abriel: The problem will just

118
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.240
Dawn Abriel: skyrocket. Oh, yeah.

119
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.790
Dawn Abriel: Anyway, that's a political thing. And I don't need to get on my soapbox

120
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.110
Dawn Abriel: Let me ask you.

121
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.850
Dawn Abriel: When did you first start using any illicit drug. How old were you

122
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.170
Gordan Ortega: Um, I started smoking marijuana. When I was 13 or something like that.

123
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.260
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and who gave it to you.

124
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.030
Gordan Ortega: Again and named my neighbor smoke.

125
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:22.260
Dawn Abriel: Has your opioid use resulted in problems with relationship and jobs.

126
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:23.790
Yes.

127
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.920
Dawn Abriel: And bright heart health is which which number program is this for you.

128
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.200
Gordan Ortega: What do you mean

129
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.090
Dawn Abriel: Is this the second time you've been in treatment. The third time fourth time

130
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.870
Gordan Ortega: I guess this will be the fourth time I went to sign up recovery.

131
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.040
Gordan Ortega: To detox three different times.

132
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.720
Okey doke.

133
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.420
Dawn Abriel: And have you ever been hospitalized for a mental health issue.

134
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.910
Gordan Ortega: Yes.

135
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.890
Dawn Abriel: What was asked for.

136
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:16.860
Gordan Ortega: One time I had a, like a mental breakdown is my PTSD and anxiety.

137
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.580
Gordan Ortega: Kind of go hand in hand with my think it's more of a dual diagnosis type of

138
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:45.810
Gordan Ortega: Thing where I have anxiety and PTSD and underlying depression and ADHD and all add and I avoid self medicated using our drugs and stuff. And if I had a prescription and probably be fine without

139
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.520
Gordan Ortega: The street drugs and all the consequences on my life. Yeah.

140
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:59.850
Dawn Abriel: Well then you answered your own question about finding a psychiatrist and boy are they tough defined in this area.

141
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:09.660
Dawn Abriel: But if you get, get yourself on a waiting list as soon as possible. I mean, I can help you with some of the medicines, but I can't prescribe the

142
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:21.000
Dawn Abriel: psych drugs. I don't. I'm an emergency medicine doctor by training. So I just don't know about the psych meds and they require you already have changes in your liver.

143
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:31.770
Dawn Abriel: So you would have to be watched very carefully, they would want to put you on medicine. That's cleared by your kidneys instead of your liver. So

144
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.750
Dawn Abriel: It's more complicated. So really, really, really get a psychiatrist.

145
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.360
Gordan Ortega: Okay, okay. You said I will have one through right heart health. Right.

146
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.760
Dawn Abriel: Now, no we don't have a psychiatrist.

147
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.860
Gordan Ortega: Okay.

148
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.660
Dawn Abriel: You're going to have to find one in Santa Fe. And again, it means getting on a waiting list.

149
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:59.730

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.090
Gordan Ortega: I'm just overwhelmed right now all the stuff I have going on and

169
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:13.920
Gordan Ortega: Like you say it was not easy to do. You got to get it on waiting lists and the time it's five to eight weeks to get into a program and

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:25.890
Gordan Ortega: This amount of money and then I'm having issues with getting my driver's license and financial issues. I just had my unemployment just ran out so

Dawn Abriel: If you hang in here for 90 days.

175
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:59.280
Dawn Abriel: It might take that long to be on the waiting list for boy and you really, really do go to the therapy.

176
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.880
Gordan Ortega: Because I also get a meeting like it. Will you give me that information right to call

177
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.130
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely.

178
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.690
Dawn Abriel: You can get a meeting fairly soon.

179
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:34.290
Dawn Abriel: And and remember therapy is a very intimate relationship if you don't feel heard and seen it, like, like you're clicking right if that's not happening there needs to be another therapist, you need to say something's not right here. No.

180
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:45.510
Dawn Abriel: No hard feelings, but I need someone else. It happens to all therapists all all doctors, you can't click with everyone. Right.

181
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.800
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, totally.

182
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.650
Dawn Abriel: But you can't do the work until you

183
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.560
Dawn Abriel: Feel a real kinship, a real relationship with the person

184
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.500
Gordan Ortega: So meetings or one on one meetings or

185
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.420
Dawn Abriel: Whatnot the group is a group, the one on one is individual therapy.

186
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.030
Gordan Ortega: Okay, and they offer both of those.

187
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.670
Dawn Abriel: You have to have both of them. If you don't do both of them you don't get your medicine that week.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.310
Gordan Ortega: Okay cool so

189
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:23.970
Dawn Abriel: I just noticed that someone walked in line and could see the screen could see your telephone

190
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:36.690
Dawn Abriel: And when you're in group and individual that can't that can't happen. You have to make sure that no one's in the same room. No one can hear it's best if you have earphones that you

191
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.500
Gordan Ortega: Know minor party right now. I have, I have some great

193
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.760
Dawn Abriel: Is convenient as it

194
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.150

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.610
Dawn Abriel: How old were you when you started

332
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:51.330
Gordan Ortega: And then I'll just do my own like push ups or whatever other kinds of exercises I can

333
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:59.340
Gordan Ortega: Yes, being incarcerated for as much as I have throughout my life makes it pretty

334
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.160
Gordan Ortega: Good at that kind of stuff. We're pretty creative as far as keeping up with my workout. Yeah.

335
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.290
Dawn Abriel: You take an aspirin every day.

336
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.580
Gordan Ortega: No.

337
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.400
Dawn Abriel: Do you have a household smoke detector.

338
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:15.750
Yes.

339
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.110
Dawn Abriel: Do you wear your seat belts.

340
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.490
Yes.

341
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.460
Dawn Abriel: Are you sexually active right now.

342
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.060
Gordan Ortega: Yes. And you practice safe sex.

343
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.540
Gordan Ortega: I suppose my girlfriend. I've been with for over two years and she's

344
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:46.770
Gordan Ortega: She has her tubes tied or some kind of operation you have children, but that's Melanie sexual partner. So, okay.

345
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.160
Dawn Abriel: And you were born male and you identify as me.

346
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.290
Gordan Ortega: Yes. Okay.

347
00:30:52.650 --> 00:31:00.780
Dawn Abriel: Tell me about benzodiazepines values Zandi bars, any of those that you use on a regular basis.

348
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:08.700
Gordan Ortega: Well, that's what I've found is bendel's or what I have found is most effective in treating my anxiety. Right now, I have

349
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.270
Gordan Ortega: Excuse me, gather painting and hydrox has been

350
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.410
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, you told me

351
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:21.270
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, and it's not nearly as effective as the enterprise alarm that I was being

352
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.220
Gordan Ortega: That I was being prescribed before, but I was

353
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:36.510
Gordan Ortega: Getting the last set of medications prescribed by Santa Fe recovery and they're not going to prescribe me bendel's but I have very

354
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.700
Dawn Abriel: Very few places will will prescribe enzymes and I really, really, really.

355
00:31:43.350 --> 00:32:03.060
Dawn Abriel: Encourage you to not take them for a couple of reasons. One is the amazing number of overdoses that happen because people combine benzodiazepines and opioids. The second one is the benzodiazepines.

356
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:17.070
Dawn Abriel: affect the brain. So you can't take in new information. You can't learn while you're on Benz's you you can't do learn new stuff when you're on bentos

357
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:25.530
Dawn Abriel: So they say that when you started using opioids. That's the age you're stuck at

358
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.760
Dawn Abriel: Because your brain can't continue growing. So the combination of opioids and benzo means

359
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:52.140
Dawn Abriel: You're, you're way behind in what other people have learned about dealing with conflict and dealing with anger and feelings and relationships to have them go smoothly. You're, you're a little behind in what most people have picked up and you know

360
00:32:53.490 --> 00:33:09.390
Dawn Abriel: The, the wiring the change in your brain that's required is what therapy does therapy rewires your brain. The benzo is don't do any rewiring all they do is make it seem like you don't care about the problem.

361
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.170
Dawn Abriel: That's why you need the therapy.

362
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.760
Dawn Abriel: And that your anxiety will

363
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:28.350
Dawn Abriel: start resolving you'll be just amazed just, you know, six months of therapy, you're going to be a different person.

364
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.510
Gordan Ortega: Okay.

365
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.850
Dawn Abriel: Where were you born and raised.
