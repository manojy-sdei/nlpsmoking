Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I'm out here in Arizona right now.

15
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.250
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, I

16
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Used to live there in Columbus, Ohio. I'm still licensed in Ohio, and I still see patients in Ohio via telemedicine.

17
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.430
Kaley Montgomery: Okay. And I actually am not in Columbus, I am in Mansfield. Okay.

18
00:02:41.970 --> 00:03:00.060
Kaley Montgomery: Not a problem. So you're not the actual doctor but I don't. Right. Are you the doctor. You're not the actual doctor. Yeah. Okay, so I was supposed to tell you, as I told one of the workers earlier that I had gotten emergency script for so be tech. I was on savvy tech for two years.

19
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.380
Kaley Montgomery: In an outreach treatment program and I'm currently I'll be 30 weeks on Tuesday 30 weeks pregnant.

20
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:26.040
Kaley Montgomery: So I got an emergency savvy tech script from my doctor here in town, and they gave me it for two weeks. So I'm not going to be able to actually fill a prescription through you guys until after or on April 7 just so that they wanted me to let you know that at least. Yeah.

21
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Not a problem.

22
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.070
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, just want me

23
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: There's something in Ohio and actually it's in every state. Now it's called a ores report. Are you familiar with that.

24
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.030
Kaley Montgomery: No. So I'm just writing down everything that you're saying

25
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that's a, it's a report that the pharmacies.

26
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Give data to and I look at it every time I write a prescription for a patient because it tells me what prescriptions you've received where you're

27
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: reading them and

28
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know when you last filled him and everything. So I look

29
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: At the orders report to see when you got your last prescription

30
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.220
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And

31
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.100
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The pharmacy wall, so check that. So they'll so we will, we know that we can't fill that until

32
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.820
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, great. Awesome. Okay, perfect.

33
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.650
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So congratulations on the baby.

34
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.710
Kaley Montgomery: Thank you. I appreciate that. No, this is my second my first is she'll be eight this year.

35
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.340
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Oh, good, good. So let's do you have 10 more weeks.

36
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.110
Kaley Montgomery: Yep about 10 more weeks.

37
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Does that make your due date.

38
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.230
Kaley Montgomery: June 13

39
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Oh, so you'll have this summer to enjoy the baby.

40
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.120
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, and I got a girl already. And this is a boy. So I get one of one of the

41
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Great. And I think you'll like raising boys, you'll find boys be easier girls.

42
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:51.630
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, much easier. My little nephews here right now. So, and they're just much easier. All the way around. Yeah, sorry, I look so rough today. I just been filling like to

43
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A deal or you

44
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:08.010
Kaley Montgomery: Know, just, um, it's like pregnancy. I haven't been regnant over seven years. So it just kind of like taking a toll on me. Plus, I wasn't never on somebody said before, with my other daughters. That was my other kids. So I didn't

45
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.660
Kaley Montgomery: It's kind of all new to me. I didn't intend to get pregnant while on Sunday tech at all. So basically,

46
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.470
Kaley Montgomery: It's just kind of like rough, you know, going through withdrawals after I had left the program that I was in for two years. It just kind of took a little bit of a toll on me.

47
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:37.980
Kaley Montgomery: Because I was at 60 milligrams a day and then I got. And then this doctor is trying to like not give me that he just has his own beliefs on it.

48
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:53.070
Kaley Montgomery: Via being pregnant and all that. So it's just I don't know I feel very withdrawal Lee right now because he just has dropped me down 10 milligrams already so I'm already. He's only given me six milligrams a day right now.

49
00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.920
Kaley Montgomery: And then in five days I'm supposed to be all the way down to five milligrams. And then on April 7 I was supposed to go back to that program and

50
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:12.180
Kaley Montgomery: Have him, Give me another script to get me down before and then he was trying to help me off before I had the baby and I didn't agree with that. So I've just been looking for another alternative to try to

51
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:22.170
Kaley Montgomery: Find something else to to do because I don't want to, you know, be going through withdrawals and being being pregnant and I just, I have my own

52
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:36.450
Kaley Montgomery: Different theories and outlooks on things I've been to kind of do a little bit of research on it and I just don't, I don't want to do that. And he's not really for that. So I'm just happy that I got into you guys sooner than later.

53
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so I've been seeing patients with addiction issues for the past three years, and I've had

54
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Several pregnant patient and it's okay, even while you're on 70

55
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.500
Kaley Montgomery: Tax yes so

56
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.930
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So yeah and so you'll

57
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Need obviously let the hospital should know

58
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And what they do is they'll check the baby and they check the big

59
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: They'll check the baby.

60
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.280
Store.

61
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.260
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Output to see

62
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.640
Kaley Montgomery: How much W Texas in

63
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: His system.

64
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.850
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And sometimes, you know, sometimes it's a little bit. Sometimes it's it's zero. So it'll just we'll just see how long

65
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How much past this time and then the hospital can

66
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Also, manage, you know, getting the Savvy tech savvy, his sister.

67
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.280
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And will keep you on Sunday.

68
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.730
Kaley Montgomery: Attacks

69
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Are you planning on breastfeeding.

70
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:30.570
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, so I do plan on breastfeeding. So that way you know, at least for the first three to five days that we are in the hospital that my OBG is aware that he

71
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.570
Kaley Montgomery: Won't have big withdrawal symptoms because of the breast milk. So he will be receiving some of the Savvy tech

72
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:44.730
Kaley Montgomery: So he won't be scoring high levels or anything like that. So we I've already discussed everything with my ob gyn we've kind of got a plan set together.

73
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:54.780
Kaley Montgomery: And put in stone. But there's other doctors just not really here with the whole plan things. So, and it was just kind of an emergency thing so that way I didn't have to go without a script.

74
00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.450
Kaley Montgomery: I didn't want have to be buying them on the street and struggling and trying to figure out what I was going to do so.

75
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:17.910
Kaley Montgomery: That was my main goal to just try to get in somewhere and at least have something. So yeah, that's why I'm here with you guys now to try to reverse that and go back to what I'm, you know, initially have been on for the last two years, maybe not as high milligrams every day.

76
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:29.340
Kaley Montgomery: And I do what I plan to taper it just wasn't the right time for me in the doctors that I was seen at the outpatient program. He said he used to be an OB GYN, and he wasn't aware of

77
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:37.170
Kaley Montgomery: Me, leaving the program, but he said he wouldn't recommend tapering me down that quickly. I'm like, I've only been with

78
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.720
Kaley Montgomery: This emergency doctor for four weeks now and he's already dropped me 10 milligrams, so

79
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:54.900
Kaley Montgomery: I don't know if it's all the way, safe and I don't really know the whole outlook on his idea of the tapering but I do agree with tapering at some point. I'm just wasn't really on to it right this right now.

80
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:01.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Sounds good. So I would like to obviously be on subjects as long as you plan to breastfeed, whether that's

81
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:19.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, three days, three months, three years it whatever people recipe for whatever amount of time. So I'll keep you on the study text for that long during that time. Okay. Um, so I'm guessing you when you are on the Suboxone you were on the I was

82
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.600
Kaley Montgomery: Never on Suboxone so I've never done the locks in I did on the street. When I first started

83
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:37.980
Kaley Montgomery: When I first started getting addicted to savvy tech. I was having to come across the box own and they would give me really bad migraines and blurred vision, so I wouldn't really take those or prefer to buy those

84
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.430
Kaley Montgomery: That's why I got into an outpatient program and got a script for the last two years of subby tech so

85
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:51.930
Kaley Montgomery: What happened was is I never really got into opiates on the street. I just started getting into savvy tech on the street. My sister got a script for 72nd I started

86
00:09:52.260 --> 00:10:08.640
Kaley Montgomery: Taking hers, and I got addicted to them and then became codependent on them. So I hadn't had an issue with street illicit drugs just suddenly tech. And then, of course, I got into a program, two and a half years ago, so I have had it taken care of for the last two and a half years.

87
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.860
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So, at the height of your drug use, how much who actually taken a day.

88
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.210
Um,

89
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.680
Kaley Montgomery: I was I was taking more when I got into the treatment program at 60 milligrams a day.

90
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:36.750
Kaley Montgomery: Then I was on the street. So I would only get my hands on, you know, not very much at the time and plus w tech wasn't really all that popular back when I started doing them about three, three and a half years ago, so

91
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.380
Kaley Montgomery: You didn't hear of them very often. There was hard to come by. I didn't do that much of them may be an eight milligram tablet, a day.

92
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:56.700
Kaley Montgomery: Is that just enough to get me by but I started at 60 milligrams to a to a day for seven days at the outpatient program that I was in. So that's where the height of it all, because

93
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. And so right now you're just on the 10 milligram, she said.

94
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yes, and you feel like you're having withdrawal with that.

95
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:14.730
Kaley Montgomery: Yes. Okay, now he's already dropped me 10 milligrams and I've only been with him for four weeks. So I was on 16 I was

96
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:24.990
Kaley Montgomery: This was, this was, I don't know most about 25 weeks pregnant and he dropped me from 60 milligrams, all the way down to now six milligrams. So I'm definitely feeling

97
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.070
Kaley Montgomery: The symptoms of like psychological withdrawals and I know the difference. Obviously I've been in counseling for it for two years.

98
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.460
Kaley Montgomery: Plus some so I know the difference between the physical and the psychological withdrawal, but I definitely feel

99
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.730
Kaley Montgomery: The physical withdrawal and he's telling me that it's all in my head. And I'm like, Well, I don't agree with that. So,

100
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:59.310
Kaley Montgomery: I need to, obviously, figure out something else, because I don't agree that whole it's just all in my head thing. So yeah, he's got me. He's trying to get me on to four milligrams by April 7 and it's just really, really taking a toll on me.

101
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm just looking, I'm looking at your history about what you've the drugs you received here so

102
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:19.260
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, yeah, just, yeah, that's a pretty rapid taper I taper already slow whenever, whenever we get to that point. I'm a slow taper or I get more success in that way. So, and that's

103
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:32.490
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Something that you and I will work together with, I don't have any goal, say by August 16 you're going to be off of this i don't i don't have that goal anywhere. So it'll just be something you know that you and I work on

104
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:39.300
Kaley Montgomery: work on together. That's great. That sounds great. Thank you, Mrs Kirby. I appreciate that. I really do.

105
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:48.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, so you've got an eight year old daughter. YOU GOT YOUR LITTLE BOY, COMING ON THE WAY. Yep. Um, are you married

106
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.570
Kaley Montgomery: No, I'm single 24 single and renting my own apartment now. Okay.

107
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.940
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Now, is that where you're at now where you're at your place or you

108
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.070
Kaley Montgomery: Know I'm not my grandmother's right now.

109
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.380
Kaley Montgomery: So I'm here for the weekend with my daughter.

110
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.480
Kaley Montgomery: I live in the field, but I'm here in Greenwich Ohio right now with my family.

111
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.790
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Nice. Okay. Are you working

112
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:21.180
Kaley Montgomery: Um, no. I was currently before this coronavirus stuff happens. So I was at a home health, a position for for a CNA or as TNA or whichever you prefer to call it.

113
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:28.920
Kaley Montgomery: I enjoyed that job, it kind of took a little bit of a toll on me at the beginning of my pregnancy. I had to drive all the way to, I don't know if you're familiar with, Delaware, Ohio.

114
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:37.980
Kaley Montgomery: Or Mount Vernon. Yeah, but that's a good hour 45 to an hour drive and it just kind of was a little bit rough on my car and

115
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:50.310
Kaley Montgomery: I had really bad morning sickness with this baby. So I just quit roughly in the end of November early December so I haven't been working for the last three months or so.

116
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.650
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so how are you supporting yourself.

117
00:13:53.310 --> 00:14:01.980
Kaley Montgomery: Um, right now I live on Metro. So I got my metro approved and I'm not actually currently struggling with bills right now, but I just

118
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:09.930
Kaley Montgomery: I got my income tax money and got a good amount of it, and I still have it leftover. And then, of course, I guess we're getting some other kinds of money here soon.

119
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:20.550
Kaley Montgomery: So I'm doing okay. As of right now, I plan to just hold out for the next 60 days or so and then go right back to working after my six week postpartum okay

120
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.540
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you have helped to watch the baby into the grandmother helper.

121
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:31.770
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah. Um, so my daughter, she's going into second grade right now she's in homeschooling, of course, because the chronic disease or whatever. So

122
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:40.530
Kaley Montgomery: She's, she's currently doing really well on that. I don't know if I wanted to keep her there or move her back to regular school but she's doing well.

123
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:51.360
Kaley Montgomery: And with the baby. I shouldn't have any issues with job and family helping me find a daycare provider if I needed to. I know I had one with my daughter and I didn't even have to pay a copay so

124
00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:06.780

150
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.640
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Right, but your tonsils are part of your immune system. They actually help increase your immunity.

Kaley Montgomery: Well that's great because I have a great immune system. So yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty thankful over that.

Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, you got other people going, Hey, I got a warranty and, you know, they

Kaley Montgomery: I was told by a girlfriend that used to go to the same out treatment program as me about you guys. Her name is April, Eddie. She

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:53.010
Kaley Montgomery: told me about, you know, giving me, she's like, well, if you guys if you're really going through this bag called bright heart health. Here's the number. This is your first step and then your second step will be to download

187
00:20:53.670 --> 00:21:02.850
Kaley Montgomery: This thing called zoom and then you'll go and do some online electronic signature thing. So that's what I did. And I got into you guys right away. I mean it.

188
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:16.860
Kaley Montgomery: just worked out so quickly. I really wasn't expecting it to go this fast. Honestly, I'm very thankful and I'm glad I ran across or I hadn't seen her. She had left human up a long time ago. So I haven't seen her. And then I ran across her. It was just like meant to happen, you know,

189
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.170
Kaley Montgomery: So I'm very thankful. Yeah.

190
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:27.630
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I thought so. I've been with bright heart health. Just a couple of weeks, but I've done this. Like I said, for three years and I don't tell them medicine with another company.

191
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:35.820
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And I'm finding know that bright heart health, they get a lot of their business from other from referrals and things from other

192
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:47.280
Jill Beavers-Kirby: People saying hey go here and do some bright heart does there. We do it a little differently. So you don't even know we're having our first initial meeting today, I'll call it in your prescription

193
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So the Sublime Text comes in, you know, eight milligram pills four milligram pills.

194
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.240
Kaley Montgomery: Into milligram pills. Right.

195
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And you said you were doing the 16 was too much probably

196
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.410
Kaley Montgomery: I don't know, I just got used to it after so long that it really wasn't

197
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.340
Kaley Montgomery: At all. But I mean if if you wouldn't consider putting me back up that far. I mean,

198
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.490
Kaley Montgomery: It's up to you. I mean it at first when I was buying them off the street.

199
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:39.480
Kaley Montgomery: When I first started into the program. I didn't expect them to give me too. So it was at first, but that was two and a half years ago. So now that's just kind of what my routine is and what I'm used to. At that point, at this point.

200
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:47.490
Kaley Montgomery: It's totally up to you. And I guess what you think about it, and I don't know.

201
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What you take when you were on the 16 were you taken them at both pills at once.

202
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.290
Kaley Montgomery: Or retail. I didn't want them in the order one. Yep, one in the morning and one before bed. That is correct.

203
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So are you on the generic or the brain.

204
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.310
Generic

205
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Let's do this.

206
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Let's do. Here's what we can do.

207
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So, you know, the pills you can break the pills and half their score to you can break them in half.

208
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.740
Kaley Montgomery: Yo, that's usually what I did. Anyways, I'm

209
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.140
Kaley Montgomery: Sorry, go ahead.

210
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:52.170
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Well, I was thinking, what I like to do is give you eight milligram pills and have you take one eight milligram pill in the morning and then how about a half a pill in the second half of the day.

211
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.880
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, whatever at dinner.

212
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:54.810
Jill Beavers-Kirby: whatever time you take it.

213
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.430
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, sure.

214
00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That'll be

215
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: 12 milligrams a day.

216
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.630
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You're getting now.

217
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Where you feel like

218
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's not working, you have the other half of pill.

219
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.470
Kaley Montgomery: That I could

220
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.080
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Take so you're not feeling like crap.

221
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:29.580
Kaley Montgomery: Right milligram in the mornings and then take like a four milligram and a half Hill, a day or half bill so just break that in half and then I'll have the other four milligram, you know, available at my fingertips if needed.

222
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.730
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, let's do that. And let's see you do

224
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. On that day, so see how

225
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The other thing that bright heart health does if they do group counseling.

226
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And our

227
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:58.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Group will meet on Wednesdays at one o'clock in the afternoon. Same thing you log on to zoom you get this zoom number and you come into a room like I know you and I are here now.

228
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:09.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And it'll be myself and a therapist in the group. And then also other patients who are, you know, in Ohio, who are also in recovery.

229
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And each we need each week. Like I said it. It's at one o'clock in the afternoon and

230
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know we just talked about how everybody's doing

231
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:38.100
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Like this week, obviously we want to know how everybody was managing what the cone of is and what stressors, they were they were coming to you know with things shutting down and places you know Ohio's locked down. You can't go anywhere unless it's a necessity necessity.

232
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.660
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So we talked about that and

233
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:49.110
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Talked about, you know, self care and. So each week we just kind of talk about how everybody's doing give you some you know tricks to get through this to you know

234
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You've got stressors going on yeah about coping.

235
00:25:51.960 --> 00:26:05.400
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And so what I really like about it with a group plan is that you know there's people who are going through it, and they've got ideas and they've got ways to manage things that I've not thought of and

236
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Maybe you haven't thought of, but

237
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.240
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, it's, I really like it. So,

238
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.070
Kaley Montgomery: I really got a lot out of the groups that I would attend

239
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:23.430
Kaley Montgomery: When I was in the outpatient program. There's a lot that you pick up on that, you know, people say that you would never expect

240
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:33.810
Kaley Montgomery: To walk into a room and and hear them say to pick up on. So I got a lot from that and I totally agree with you. So I like the whole idea of being there once a week.

241
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:42.930
Kaley Montgomery: At the same time every day. So it's, it's, you know, it's the same routine. I really like a scheduled routine. I'm very OCD very planned out

242
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:58.440
Kaley Montgomery: Like to agenda. Nice. So I like, I like that. That's great. I'm glad that it's. And then, of course, my friend, April said that there is, you know, places where you could come in to contact and actually see her. Maybe in a group chat.

243
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:05.370
Kaley Montgomery: So I don't know if that's what she meant like like we're all in the same room together on the same day, or how it works.

244
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:15.180
Kaley Montgomery: For health, but she was just kind of giving me some ideas where she might, you know, run a cost me on on on here also. Yeah. That's really nice. Yeah.

245
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's nice. It works out well.

246
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.610
Yeah.

247
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.590
Kaley Montgomery: Anyway, make sure I got the right pharmacy in here for you.

248
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.080
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I've got CVS pharmacy on West fourth

249
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:36.720
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, so it's on the corner of was forth in trouble. So it's 1049 North trouble road. Okay. And it's on the corner of Fourth Street. That's how I got. OK.

250
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:41.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I'll call you or center prescription and as soon as we get off the phone today.

251

Jill Beavers-Kirby: If you need to contact me. You just call the care coordinators and they'll get in touch with me. They we have a little system where they can contact me right away and get it get a hold of things.

252
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:06.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And I'm gonna, I mean, I know you're you just got your medicine, but because this is a dose increase, I will put that note on the prescription to the pharmacy will know

Kaley Montgomery: Which is increasing your dose. Okay. And then what they're aware that I was getting 60 milligrams and I just have stopped within getting the 60 milligrams with this within like a four month timeframe, so

255
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:29.670
Kaley Montgomery: I guess it's not, you know, back to where I was. Well, technically you're right it is back to where I was. So I guess.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:38.610
Kaley Montgomery: It might not be an issue. But I don't know your you know more than I know so. So I guess, whatever you're recommending that we do, we should probably do.

Kaley Montgomery: I just oh yes there is questions so

311
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:33.570
Kaley Montgomery: This is this is new. I'm glad to find out that I am getting a whole month ago because my biggest worry was, what am I going to do when I go into have the baby at the hospital.

312
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:42.990
Kaley Montgomery: Am I supposed to be taking my own script, or are they supposed to provide me with my dosage. Are they going to contact you to verify that I do get a script.

313
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:58.290
Kaley Montgomery: Like, what should I do. Should I give them the contact information now to my new doctor that you guys, but her health so that way they can get in touch with you to find out you know that I am verified savvy tech certified, you know, is it a prescription. Okay.

314
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.190
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yes, to give give right heart health contact information to your OB GYN

315
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:15.750
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, perfect. And then a month should be plenty enough obviously to get me through while I have the baby at the hospital and I do have them. Give me my milligrams while I'm there in the state correct or

316
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.020
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Not hospitals are different, they might want you to bring your own in

317
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.830
Kaley Montgomery: Okay.

318
00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.860
Jill Beavers-Kirby: They might just want you to bring your own pills in in the original bottle.

319
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.060
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, right.

320
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that's how

321
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: When I was in Columbus and my pregnant patients there. That's how the hospitals in Columbus would do it.

322
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.910
Kaley Montgomery: Okay, great. And now, so like I'm

323
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:44.940
Kaley Montgomery: Like any is, do you know like, are you aware of, like, any issues like I know like I've talked to my first doctor in the now the second doctor he he makes it seem like

324
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.820
Kaley Montgomery: It's a big issue.

325
00:33:48.990 --> 00:34:01.110
Kaley Montgomery: That the baby comes out addicted to subject versus going through withdrawals in my belly D. What is your opinions on that. What do you think, like, do you think that you'll be okay coming out.

326
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.160
Kaley Montgomery: I think

327
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:10.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: If he absorbs any of the subtext at this dose it will be very, very minimal and not enough to harm him.

328
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Right patience on higher doses.

329
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.190
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And their baby did not have any subject in the system.

330
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:26.070
Kaley Montgomery: Well, that's great. So, but with me breastfeeding. Um, that'll put that'll put it in his in his makoni them right. Yeah.

331
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:32.220
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, so I so he could test positive for me okay and

332
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.240
Kaley Montgomery: And that's okay.

333
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's not that we're not expecting

334
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:47.220
Kaley Montgomery: Right, right, right. Yeah. And I do expect that I do probably expect you know Children's Services. I don't know if they do that kind of thing here. I don't know what their whole big ordeal or plan is on that whole thing.

335
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:53.220
Kaley Montgomery: I just know that I if that comes about. I will give them your guys's contact information so

336
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, I've never

337
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I've not had a problem with

338
00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:08.070
Jill Beavers-Kirby: With any problems with children's services or it's just looking at the the information about the drug. Just checking. Some things just to see exactly what it said about you know the pregnancy stuff.

339
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:17.550
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, I do. I look it up all the time. So it says that it does get the baby's getting very, like, it's like getting not even a whole half of what I get.

340
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:34.530
Kaley Montgomery: Right now, so at the point where you know he's born, it may be like a 30% chance that He even goes through withdrawal symptoms at all. So please don't at all which could be a very big, you know, a very great thing for me.

341
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:45.330
Kaley Montgomery: I'd really really really like that, plus breastfeeding him so he may not be scoring any kind of symptoms on the hospital may just get to take him home within the first three days of being there.

342
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.040
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yep, and that's

343
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.540
Kaley Montgomery: What I've had forward to

344
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, that's what that's what will happen. That's what I've had happened in the past.

345
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.270
Kaley Montgomery: Well, that sounds great. And that makes me feel so much better. This other doctors just kind of putting my head.

346
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:08.910
Kaley Montgomery: Some just I don't know things I just wasn't expecting. I didn't want to get pregnant on savvy tech. Anyways, just because I didn't want to have to deal with, you know, a baby that needed

347
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:16.500
Kaley Montgomery: More care and in the whole symptoms of withdrawal. I just know what it feels like to withdraw. I can imagine my newborn baby going through it.

348
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:16.920
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah.

349
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm gonna know he should be okay.

350
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:29.160

352
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:42.210
Kaley Montgomery: Which I shouldn't because I've been managing fine you know tapering down so quickly that I should be okay.

353
