Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, because the all of my kids internet online school stuff just crashed and I saw a couple times, it said you have unstable internet. So if something happens just kind of log back in and we can communicate through tags. If it gets really bad.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I

10
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that you had. You certainly didn't ask for it, but I started making some calls about formula, did you end up resolving the issue.

11
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:22.560
Alicia Noedel: I get my my wick tomorrow, I think. And then I have a wicked appointment, the day after. Um, but they said that they have some at Walmart. So it's just going to go there with my wick. Okay. Excellent. And do you

12
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling hopeful about that or is this a really big scary thing. Even this morning right now.

13
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.720
Alicia Noedel: No, I'm not worried about it.

14
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good, good, good, good. Yeah. So, but it was a good opportunity for me and I wrote down some numbers. I think I'll share them in group today.

15
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The Road Runner Food Bank, the storehouse.

16
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Just places that kind of offer some support for folks.

21
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.410
I have it open up now.

22
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see where I'll have to open up recent file open recent New Mexico resources. Okay, I just started typing this up. Um, we gone I can share, share screen share

23
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see. I didn't write the beret Foundation, which is interesting because there was a woman there she ended up giving me her cell phone number two. She was so sweet.

24
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk with her at length on Friday, and it's not typed in here. I'm going to write it. Um, it's actually a women's shelter.

25
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: They accept newborns and their mothers. It's about 90 minutes from Espanola we leave a message every day. Okay, so, but it's not in here. Hold on. And I'm actually going to type it right here know if I'm spelling it right. I'll have to look up the correct way to spell it.

26
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.730
Alicia Noedel: I didn't know that Esperanza shelter helped people. I used to live the Esperanza shelter for, like, a few months.

27
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you you live there yourself.

28
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.870
Alicia Noedel: At the Esperanza. Yeah.

29
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you think of it.

30
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.420
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, they're really great place are awesome.

31
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so glad

32
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put a little smiley face.

33
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know, because I'm not used to being like, I'm going to be sort of referring this for people

34
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.740
Alicia Noedel: And it's a battered women's shelter. Exactly.

35
00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:10.380
Alicia Noedel: Um, they have alarms on the doors so like if someone like if someone's abuser were to break in, they would have notification like right away and they have like a fence. They don't let anybody in unless you know, or they are there and you're staying there. It's a really cool place.

36
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I noticed up here. Now, I saw some other numbers for store house. But sometimes when I would call it and get all the way through all these me see, where is it store.

37
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.460
Alicia Noedel: Versus Hayden morning and all the way all throughout New Mexico where they

38
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just this one's in Albuquerque this number right here. This first one in blue is Albuquerque.

39
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven five and six crews us. And then it says boosted food assistance, just by itself. And I was like, Well, I don't know, but it was under on the website for food runner bank. So I think it might be associated

40
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.510
Alicia Noedel: With it.

41
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just put it under here.

42
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the storehouse are a couple numbers. I didn't get to type it. I'm going to take right underneath it so I can add that

43
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: 505 and some of these might be bad.

44
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight. I did 842 already 6491 and then I see 884 dash

45
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.600
Alicia Noedel: Go these, you have a couple options, you know. Yeah.

46
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.220
There's something I gotta check out with the mail mail service was, I don't know what that is.

47
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me hit

48
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop share

49
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.610
Okay.

50
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

51
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me open up a note for us.

52
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.210
Alicia Noedel: So,

53
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing on an emotional level.

54
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.190
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

55
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.780
Alicia Noedel: Too bad.

56
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about your sweetheart when he's laid off right now job. The car's not working.

57
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:19.560
Alicia Noedel: He's okay. We had to take on a stock car to the pediatrician, the other day, all the way in Santa Fe, because she has oral thrush.

58
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:29.790
Alicia Noedel: It's like a yeast infection in there now. Okay. And it's all the way around her lips her tongue or her palate everywhere.

59
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:42.660
Alicia Noedel: And she had to get antibiotics for it and the antibiotics, they're causing her poop to be like acidic. So it's like giving her this like really crazy burn diaper rash and we're just dealing with that.

60
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you get up there.

61
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.180
Alicia Noedel: I'm my mom do some right

62
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And your relationship with your mom. What's that like

63
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:10.140
Alicia Noedel: Currently we're I would say we're at a really good place I'd say really the best in my whole life.

64
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to stop my video and see if that helps. Okay, let me see if it

65
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, which would be better. You would it be better than at least you're looking at me. Why don't you turn yours off because then I'm the one kind of this way, at least you feel like I'm president. Once you turn your video off. And I'll just let's see if it improves audio at all.

66
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.660
Alicia Noedel: Okay, can you hear me better now.

67
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, listen, we'll get we'll keep talking and see if it does, we're going to do.

68
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.440
Alicia Noedel: A

69
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.760
Little experiment.

70
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the best than it ever has been.

71
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I like hearing that

72
00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:12.810
Alicia Noedel: Well, you know, she was on drugs for many, many years. She was a crack user and then heroin, you know, pills, she you know did it all and she was a monster. And she was on drugs. And so, you know, she's not

73
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.090
Alicia Noedel: On anything now.

74
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.200
Alicia Noedel: And she's a completely different person. So

75
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was thinking today if you wanted to, we could

76
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, take what you just said and sort of go with that kind of go with maybe starting to develop this thermometer this subjective unit of distress thermometer so that I can kind of get a sense of things. And if we have time, we could do some am Dr.

77
00:08:49.470 --> 00:09:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But I see a note to myself and I put it at 16 but I also see need to confirm there's there's no number associated with it. So there's something in here that says dad wasn't constantly abusive, most of the time he was the savior or my mom would go when my mom would go on her filing rages

78
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:29.820
Alicia Noedel: She read get to like these points because she's bipolar manic depressive and she wasn't diagnosed for it at the time.

79
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:41.040
Alicia Noedel: And so she could go from, you know, being, you know, fine to just snapping for the smallest things

80
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.730
Alicia Noedel: My, my dad. Usually you know if he was there weren't a lot

81
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:59.730
Alicia Noedel: But if he was there he could like MIDI the situation or, you know, just tell her leave her alone. Like, she's just a little girl like leave her alone.

82
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.900
Alicia Noedel: But there were a few times where my dad got

83
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:12.600
Alicia Noedel: I you know I respect to my dad and I was scared of my dad, but I wasn't scared of my dad. The way I was my mom.

84
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.180
Alicia Noedel: It was more respect for him.

85
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.640
Alicia Noedel: But he did

86
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:31.740
Alicia Noedel: There was one time he, my brother was complaining that I had stolen something from him that I didn't, he went missing. I don't know what happened to it and

87
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:49.440
Alicia Noedel: He had been complaining about it for like two, three days. And my dad finally got upset and he went into my room and brought my brother in the room with him and he kicked me in my stomach like four or five times. Yeah, and

88
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad kicked you are you

89
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.060
Alicia Noedel: Yes, my dad and

90
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it because he thinks you took something

91
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:07.350
Alicia Noedel: It's because he was telling my brother. Is this what you want. Is this what you wanted. This is what you wanted me to do. And like I don't

92
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:15.570
Alicia Noedel: Know my dad was really, you know, I don't know his thought process was really weird.

93
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.510
Okay.

94
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, I'm trying to picture it so your brother take something dad goes to address it. And instead of hitting your brother or punishing or disciplining they punish you.

95
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.760
Alicia Noedel: Know my brother said that I had

96
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:47.430
Alicia Noedel: I had stolen something from my brother that I had stolen, one of his something. I don't remember. I think it was like you yo cards or something stupid.

97
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

98
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.160
Alicia Noedel: And he had been complaining that I took my took them for days like two, three days.

99
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're noticing maybe that

100
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Following your explanation of I wasn't as afraid I'm not afraid of my dad I respected him not like you were afraid of your mother and the very next story is he gave an example of him kicking you in the stomach.

101
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.690
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, that was that was like the only

102
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:30.150
Alicia Noedel: Time he had ever gotten like really physically violent, which means like I don't ever

103
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.100
Okay.

104
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What was a typical that one was the really physically violent. What's a typical one

105
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.330
Alicia Noedel: I mean it.

106
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.500
Alicia Noedel: There were probably one or one or two times where

107
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.580
Alicia Noedel: He slapped me in the face.

108
00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:13.800
Alicia Noedel: Not like a hard like intense but but I was scared of my dad in a way that I knew what he could do. I didn't know he could, he would, you know, I didn't think he would do anything to me but I saw the extent he almost killed my my auntie in front of us. When I was a kid.

109
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.650
Alicia Noedel: And my mom was killed my mom and my auntie and the same night.

110
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

111
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like I saw

112
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: How scary. He can be

113
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not push. I won't push it. I'll

114
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.120
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

115
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're what you're calling respect initially under further processing maybe closer to fear.

116
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:57.990
Alicia Noedel: I mean, you know, my dad. He got up every morning at five o'clock and walked you know 40 miles to work if the bus wasn't running in the middle of winter. He worked really hard for us.

117
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:12.810
Alicia Noedel: He took really good care of us as much as he could. I respected my data block, but you know my dad was abused his whole life as a child way farther worse than I could ever imagine my childhood being

118
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:27.840
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, they told him in when he lived in a psychiatric ward that he wasn't physically or mentally capable of taking care of children and that he shouldn't have kids, you know, so

119
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.440
Alicia Noedel: I thought things could have been a lot worse, you know,

120
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I see you for a minute, maybe bring your video back on.

121
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So I hear what you're saying is you

122
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Temper

123
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What you deserved with what his history was

124
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's very kind of you to do that.

125
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It could have been worse. And that's, that's, in some ways is a as an adaptive skill that many people lack and it's a handy one to have

126
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, however, you don't have to do that piece.

127
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know how much you've compromised your needs.

128
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This, you don't have to do it again. Not in here you see the difference. I will never, I will never think you're a selfish little girl. How dare you want more when your dad's walking miles at five in the morning I'll never think it it'll never even like what no in here. You get to say

129
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: parts about

130
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I was cold. I was hungry.

131
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I was terrified.

132
00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In here, you don't have to protect the psychology

133
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.040
Alicia Noedel: Of your parents.

134
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in not in here.

135
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know that you have that mindset I won't be going in. You'll never going to grow election without will Lisa. Well, at least you didn't have it as bad as your parents did not going to get that in here.

136
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.570
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

137
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

138
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know you have that

139
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: down pat, what it has done in some ways is very adaptive it's kept you alive is kept you not not being so angry and resentful towards your family that you couldn't at least get a little bit of resources that they had. And I think that was probably very wise as a little one, but

140
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not in that

141
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.790
Alicia Noedel: Situation right now.

142
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're more capable than you were when you were little, you just are

143
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.810
Alicia Noedel: Okay, okay.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission.

148
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To be scared to be angry to be confused to be resentful said all of it without having to doubt those initial responses. Okay.

149
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to take care of me the way you had to take care of your family.

150
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.450
Alicia Noedel: I just don't know how to break that pattern.

151
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.880
Alicia Noedel: Taking care.

152
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.970
Alicia Noedel: Get so tiring.

153
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: My job is to know how

154
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: My jobs to know how that's why you're here.

155
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I have ever been of confidence on that how I've been witness to

156
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Too many people's

157
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Journey and you're not doing it alone. You're doing it with with me. You're doing it with your sweetheart. You're doing it with your baby doing it with yourself. Each time that you hold on to your truth.

158
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't compromise it

159
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's growth in the direction and take pride in it each time you decide not to

160
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a compulsive behavior and you sit with sadness or you sit with fear. You sit with your own anger.

161
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your healing.

162
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it comes

163
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:52.920
Alicia Noedel: You know, you're saying right now that I think about it like that whole. It sounds like I'm like I am. I'm sorry. I was sticking up for him, you know, because I don't want someone to think bad about my mom or my dad, you know, but honestly

164
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.590
Alicia Noedel: The house was a hell yes it was so bad.

165
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.390
Alicia Noedel: I was like eight years old, like wanting to die like I didn't

166
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.980
Alicia Noedel: I wanted to do it anymore.

167
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.420
Alicia Noedel: I didn't want to do it anymore.

168
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You survive.

169
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Responding to this topic right now just kind of scan.

170
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.510
Alicia Noedel: Kind of like quivering okay

171
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And from zero to 100 where we add as far as distress level.

172
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.690
Um,

173
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.450
Alicia Noedel: You feel like 50 I just get triggered when I think about it.

174
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed your tearful. What will you actually thinking. Can you let me in some of those thoughts that pass through on

175
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:49.410
Alicia Noedel: It just, it feels like I relive things like I can feel it like being in bed like at three in the morning and hearing me know like never knowing when I'm going to be waking up at three in the morning, my parents fist fighting in the kitchen or like

176
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:59.580
Alicia Noedel: One of my dad's friends, you know, tried to stab him in cut his shirt open. He came into my room and was freaking out, or like

177
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:08.700
Alicia Noedel: No, no, knowing that I wasn't going to eat into like six o'clock at night because it was nothing in the house and my dad was at work and

178
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.710
Alicia Noedel: I'm not being able to open the door, no, like, you know, I wasn't allowed to open the door.

179
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.810
Alicia Noedel: If someone asked. I was supposed to hide and pretend like known as home.

180
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:35.100
Alicia Noedel: It was really like weird. It was just very, you know, don't talk about our life, you know, everything's fine at home. Don't tell anybody. What's going on, you're fine.

181
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:51.840
Alicia Noedel: And so like I couldn't tell anybody what was happening. You know, I was. I didn't have any friends at school. So, you know, I didn't have anybody to vent to. And so I was just dealing with everything just in my own head all the time.

182
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not so much.

183
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:09.330
Alicia Noedel: No, never apologized. He said something mean to me grab me by my hair.

184
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.590
Alicia Noedel: I don't know any, anything that happened. No one ever said sorry for it. We never acknowledged that it was something wrong.

185
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And

186
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

187
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You said that some relationship with your mother is better than it ever has been.

188
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I wonder just what do you like about the relationship

189
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.940
Alicia Noedel: My mom were

190
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:02.190
Alicia Noedel: When I was like three or four, that's when my mom started doing drugs. And so she did drugs, all the way to

191
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:15.570
Alicia Noedel: You know 1314 and that's when I stopped talking to her, and then we got back into each other's lives. But we weren't very close my dad when he died when I was 17 she was really, really there for me and

192
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:27.420
Alicia Noedel: I decided, you know that I want to not have a relationship with my mom and feel like I'm losing both parents. Okay. And so

193
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:44.160
Alicia Noedel: Me, you know, meet my mom. She is very supportive of everything that I do. She's been very apologetic for everything in her have held each other and grind for hours about everything you know all the turmoil and everything.

194
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.590
Alicia Noedel: We have very similar, since if you were. I know that I can talk to her about anything. Okay.

195
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, and an apology.

196
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.080
Alicia Noedel: Of sorta okay

197
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It just wasn't a bad

198
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.070
Alicia Noedel: Multiple times. Okay. All right.

199
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.550
Alicia Noedel: At least 30 times

200
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And

201
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: How is she staying clean

202
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.040
Alicia Noedel: Um,

203
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.060
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

204
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:36.150
Alicia Noedel: She's just I think that no, she's gotten older, and she's ruin her body so much that she can handle it like

205
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:50.790
Alicia Noedel: When I was when I was like nine I think she tried to rob some drug dealers, she was. She don't she sold crack for a little while and the person who would get her her supply

206
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.720
Alicia Noedel: When she started doing her her you know some stuff that she was supposed to sell instead of selling it.

207
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:11.850
Alicia Noedel: She called him and she told him that she needed more to sell. But she didn't and she was going to do it all. And so she went to go steal it from him and they ran her over hitter at the car.

208
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:21.870
Alicia Noedel: ran over once and then back up and running over again. And they got the car and they tried to Reaper like five five guys and

209
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:39.120
Alicia Noedel: Apparently my dad heard her screaming in front of the house and he rescued her. But, uh, now she has lupus and fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis, you know, a bunch of problems with her body that she can, you know, handle

210
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.700
Alicia Noedel: Any kind of drugs, you know,

211
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying she's not transferred an addiction to an opiate addiction.

212
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:58.830
Alicia Noedel: She did have opiate addiction for a while, but she was on her own savvy tech program with her doctors

213
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.520
Alicia Noedel: For a while too because she didn't want to do it anymore.

214
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.980
Alicia Noedel: But our addictions were separate

215
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:15.360
Alicia Noedel: We never did anything together like that or anything she she didn't have any idea.

216
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't think she's using Suboxone or anything at this time.

217
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:27.780
Know,

218
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If she were to use again.

219
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be a sign that you might notice that she wants.

220
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.190
Alicia Noedel: Depends what it is.

221
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.690
Alicia Noedel: She actually different on everything.

222
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:59.580
Alicia Noedel: Distance anger. Anger starts to get like mood swings and stuff. Okay.

223
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like for you, you're protecting your recovery.

224
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: To see that someone like your mother.

225
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Might not be making decisions.

226
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.500
Alicia Noedel: I'd be sitting with her.

227
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But remember that it right if we if we buy into this idea that active addiction, the authentic self that voice has been quiet and it's not speaking up has been overcome sort of by that other voice so

228
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.840
In a sense,

229
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Timing is to pull away from the attic. We don't want to surround ourselves with people that are using because your mother, the authentic mother isn't around right now. It sounds like she is

230
00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: When she's if she starts isolating angry outbursts erratic inconsistent behavior.

231
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't forget to pay

232
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention to what you're seeing

233
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.680
Alicia Noedel: Oh, definitely. Yeah. And I have to be very, you know,

234
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.010
Alicia Noedel: Like, you know, very, I don't know how to how to say it like

235
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:27.420
Alicia Noedel: Into it, I guess because she does have bipolar manic depressive disorder and also sometimes she does, you know,

236
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.240
Alicia Noedel: Have her days where she you know goes up and down, but it's different. It's way different.

237
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.130
Alicia Noedel: It's never violent and that's how I would know.

238
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:50.190
Alicia Noedel: If she were to, you know, be screaming at everybody and cutting everybody out and that's how I would, you know, yeah.

239
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got a goal here, it's time for us to kind of review them.

240
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I never one of your goals here never get back to where I was using heroin. That's one of your goals.

241
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.810
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, that was the first one.

242
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha. So we're going to do a little check in.

243
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And sort of describe in your own words, how you're assessing progress on your goal of I never want to get back to where I was using heroin. How are you doing, and your own assessment.

244
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.430
Alicia Noedel: I think at the moment I'm doing really good

245
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.530
Alicia Noedel: You know anastasi has a big motivation for me.

246
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.850
Alicia Noedel: You know, I also don't

247
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:58.830
Alicia Noedel: I don't want my dad to to see in. I know. Like he died of a heroin overdose.

248
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.230
Alicia Noedel: I don't, I don't want to

249
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:03.360
Alicia Noedel: You know,

250
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.660
Alicia Noedel: I don't want to

251
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: See if he can finish that thought. It's almost done. I don't want my dad to see what

252
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.910
Alicia Noedel: I don't want him to

253
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.530
Alicia Noedel: It's hard to explain the way I feel about it.

254
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay. So, but there's but here's what you said. So see if you can see it out here. You said I don't want my dad to see, and then you didn't finish the sentence. And then you said

255
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.540
Alicia Noedel: I was trying to rephrase it you know

256
00:30:51.930 --> 00:31:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, it's okay. But, but just look at it out here and then you'll, you'll see possibly that connection, I don't want my dad to see that that that that that he died of a heroin overdose.

257
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Those two things. How do they go together.

258
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.110
Alicia Noedel: I don't, I don't want to

259
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.420
Alicia Noedel: Be that

260
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.940
Alicia Noedel: I don't want my daughter to be without me. I don't want to go down that same

261
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.590
Alicia Noedel: I don't want my dad to

262
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:33.660
Alicia Noedel: I don't want my family to be labeled, you know, worthless drug addicts. You know, like, okay, my dad was so much more

263
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.030
Alicia Noedel: Oh, than a drug addict and, you know,

264
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And ELISA, I am so much more than a try.

265
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.380
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

266
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it, are we getting close. Yeah, yeah, I'm more than just this chemical dependence.

267
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:06.840
Alicia Noedel: Because honestly, when you do get dependent on substance. People just you.

268
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.340
Alicia Noedel: Know, they're just a heroin addict or just a crack at like you

269
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.010

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Engine that vessel that you're in.

273
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been driven by at least two

274
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.260
Alicia Noedel: Ways.

275
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.100
One.

276
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling you

277
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You can handle it. Go escape. One is telling you

278
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take the easy way you'll feel good now.

279
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.680
Alicia Noedel: Just feel good now.

280
00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Get out of it feel good. Now that's the attic this vessel that body. I'm looking at right now has also been aware that that drugs and alcohol mood altering substances are unhealthy for the body.

281
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And that physical abuse that emotional abuse is unhealthy for the body, the mind, the soul.

282
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not that body is not just one thing you're lots of things.

283
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And it changes from day to day minutes a minute.

284
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that I stay vigilant on is who is driving the decision today.

285
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's the attic.

286
00:33:47.790 --> 00:34:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What will we notice. Well, at least to start missing appointments and making excuses will alicea get herself into an emergency department, an accident so clumsy or doctor shop or get herself sick or maybe stop sharing honest things

287
00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

288
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your signs we touched for a second on your mom's right and aggression and we can see it in her. What about you. What is the sign that I can put in our relapse prevention plan that I'm always it's always growing always writing little notes in it.

289
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If I start to see it. If someone in the group sources say oh okay you're acting kind of different. What is your husband going to see, what are we going to see what are you going to notice in yourself when you are starting down that road of almost really an emotional relapse.

290
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:57.930
Alicia Noedel: Kind of checking out, I guess, you know, because to me feeling my feelings is a good thing. You know, I feel my feelings.

291
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:08.490
Alicia Noedel: And I kind of check out and I just, I don't care. I don't care about

292
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:21.510
Alicia Noedel: You know I wouldn't be sharing talking about it, you know, if I was high right now, I would be like, oh, everything's fine or, you know, I don't have any worries in the world. Everything's awesome

293
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, we got it.

294
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Powerful

295
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.080
Alicia Noedel: But, you know, if one day I go today's good that's that's

296
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.930
Alicia Noedel: Just me having a good day, you know,

297
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything's awesome. But if I hear that I might take a pause.

298
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.440
Alicia Noedel: I mean,

299
00:35:47.970 --> 00:36:05.040
Alicia Noedel: Say we go into group one day or, you know, into our meeting and nothing bugging me today. I feel okay but you know I don't want to share anything on a one on one meeting, everything's firing.

300
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.730
Alicia Noedel: Have haven't had anything on my mind at all.

301
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.460
Alicia Noedel: That's just not me.

302
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:18.360
Alicia Noedel: You know, I'm a world full person I constantly thinking about everything except for one

303
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.880
Alicia Noedel: May think that's what makes it so appealing, you know,

304
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

305
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote down what you said, but in this scenario, you just came up with. It's already. You've already relaxed.

306
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That kind of stuff. I'm I love what you said, it's very useful because I might be able to catch something in drawing out and kind of start having a conversation with the addict, because you the authentic self didn't show up to group that day the bullshit or showed up.

307
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, that's good. It's good for me to know that I've got some great language to keep my ears out for. But I'm talking about laughs Come slow. It can take years it sneaks up slowly.

308
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about you may have information around not sharing

309
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Please see, if we see in group where you've decided

310
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To stop sharing you're withdrawing you're starting to pull back.

311
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you heard me say, or someone in the group say that's kind of interesting, and they see a normal you you really share personal information, I noticed I'm kind of a superficial response.

312
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

313
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And then do you think that we would predictively. See defensiveness or a little irritability, like a back off.

314
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.690
Alicia Noedel: Stumble probably

315
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How many what stumbled means, tell me.

316
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.480
Alicia Noedel: Like, try to

317
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.860
Alicia Noedel: Make up something on the spot.

318
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'd lie.

319
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.780
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, probably.

320
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.740
Alicia Noedel: Okay, if you know the addict didn't me is a liar.

321
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. Uh huh.

322
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody's is

323
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:35.880
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I think it's just like I'm a people pleaser too and I really, I always have been.

324
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:43.890
Alicia Noedel: So, you know, it's one of those things where, you know, if I if I really

325
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.640
Alicia Noedel: Am thinking about using

326
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:54.540
Alicia Noedel: I and I know that you know someone doesn't want me to, you know, I would try and hide it from them.

327
00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.230
Alicia Noedel: I feel like I don't want you do that.

328
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how people pleaser might show up in this setting, and in in group.

329
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder how it would show up.

330
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:26.580
Alicia Noedel: For me, and the way that it's been showing up is, you know, you guys want me to share. And I know he want me to share. I know that you guys want me to be involved.

331
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:34.860
Alicia Noedel: And that's, you know what I'm doing, what I've been doing because I know that that's what I'm here for. And that's what's going to help me. Okay.

332
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you're sharing might change like they won't be personal stories anymore. They'll be philosophies.

333
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.780
Alicia Noedel: Instead, or no, okay, I've never thought about it before.

334
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.130
Alicia Noedel: I wonder ever had anybody questioning

335
00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I i'm I'm a pretty good little detective. So I noticed I noticed because your style is almost consistently a personal it's exactly what

336
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking for that helps the group and that helps you. So you're you're doing exactly what's being invited. I guess what I wonder is

337
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If all of a sudden you say things like, and you you've heard people do this. Well, you know, you know, you're supposed to do supposed to like just kind of put God first we supposed to like call your friends and kind of stay distracted. So those are philosophies. Those are just

338
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.780
Alicia Noedel: You didn't you should have what I do.

339
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.950
Alicia Noedel: What I instead of just like you should

340
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So, and you do more than that, you

341
00:40:46.080 --> 00:41:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You go just eloquently into I'm scared I'm sad. I don't write this formula. And this is what it means to me and you just very linear thinking you explain it. And I imagine that if that disappears. I think I'm going to notice.

342
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.420
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

343
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I will tell you that if the addict is the one that's communicating typically they get really pissed off at me.

344
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they don't like it and call it out.

345
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.200
Yeah.

346
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I'm trying to say.

347
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: YEAH, I LIKE, WELL, WELL, GET BACK OFF lady. I'm telling the truth. Now the thing about me is all only push maybe once one and a half. I will confront confront like oh that's not really you you're not, you're not going to hear something like that.

348
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But what will probably happen is all kind of remember it. And then when we meet again maybe

349
00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I might start to hear how the only thing you care about is your husband.

350
00:41:52.140 --> 00:42:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I just need to make him happy. I just need to make him happy. And you mean like it doesn't matter what what's going on. For me, the most important thing is is that he's happy. I might do you think I might start hearing, hearing, things like that.

351
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.090
Alicia Noedel: No, no.

352
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.760
Alicia Noedel: I've never

353
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.590
Alicia Noedel: Felt like I would feel really shitty about myself and I relapsed honestly

354
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay, yeah. So what we'll all put a pin in this relapse prevention concept. It's my point is to say, it typically doesn't happen overnight or in an instant.

355
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we've started to open the door to someone texting. We drove down the street. We know we shouldn't have.

356
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We gave ourselves permission.

357
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To isolate more than we usually do. It's a setup.

358
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.950
Alicia Noedel: It's not

359
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We weren't sharing as much as we we used to really lean in on his best friend and now now.

360
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I used to talk to my fiance. But you know what, I don't want to be a burden.

361
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the setup. That's how slick. This is days, weeks, months to set up and I call it a reservation and everyone's like WeChat my reservation.

362
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So reservation for a relapse or setting it up and that is what I'm talking about. It's we pay attention to the really subtle ways that we make it possible for that life again. And what I hope is that we don't do that we

363
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Create create this life that it just doesn't make any sense to us. It's like, well,

364
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.230
Alicia Noedel: I'm

365
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I have all this accountability. Now I'm so proud of what I've done. Look how how many coping skills. I have now, I've been telling so many people but like you have this whole new sort of

366
00:43:48.210 --> 00:44:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Lifestyle where it just doesn't add up. But when we don't make those changes. And we're still surrounding ourselves with people that are like it's normal that you use is normal. Then I'm going to call you out on it.

367
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: They're used to you people pleasing. They're not going to expect you to be honest, open Frank direct to sort of. That's it. It's like, how is she said in her life up so that it no longer makes sense to listen to the voice of addiction.

368
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.970
Alicia Noedel: I'm pretty confident radio

369
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.110
Excellent.

370
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.370
Alicia Noedel: And yes, you're not. I mean, and for the future. I am

371
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.850
Alicia Noedel: Confident that I am not gonna

372
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.090
Alicia Noedel: Do anything that's going to jeopardize

373
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.960
Alicia Noedel: You know, so the good life that I have, I have a good life right now. It's the best it's ever been.

374
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.520
Alicia Noedel: I haven't been scared upset hurt.

375
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:48.900
Alicia Noedel: You know, and so long.

376
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.790
Alicia Noedel: I'm

377
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.410
Gonna get better.

378
00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:02.760
Alicia Noedel: So many problems that I have is with myself like I, you know, with my internal thoughts, you know,

379
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You just did some very hard work today. We talked about difficult topics as I continue to work on some targets that I want to do the EMT are with okay

380
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It's important. You're doing important stuff. So I noticed. Um, I put age eight I was in hell. I put it on a

381
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:26.970
Are you sure it's a 50

382
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:29.310
Alicia Noedel: At the time,

383
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.580
Alicia Noedel: Or at when I think about it.

384
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, why don't you tell me how bad it was when you were eight

385
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.330
Alicia Noedel: Eight or nine. Yeah.

386
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.120
Alicia Noedel: It was that was like the peak.

387
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:56.310
Alicia Noedel: You want me to put it on 190 9090 95 back

388
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

389
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.030
Alicia Noedel: I mean, it could have been worse, but only bad

390
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about this one. Because remember, I started this off with trying to get dad was constantly abusive, most of the time was a savior. My mom would go under by the ranges and then we added to it and then right it was this sort of continued discussion, but that part about dad was

391
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: dad wasn't

392
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Constantly juices. Sorry, I misspoke. What I'm

393
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we do with a number that goes with

394
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: dad wasn't constantly abusive.

395
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.370
Alicia Noedel: I wouldn't even say 10% no he me like three times my life.

396
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What about this one. I was scared of dad, but he almost killed my auntie and my mom, the same night.

397
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:53.160
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, what do we do with that one that's looking at scary. Okay.

398
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.080
Alicia Noedel: So terrifying. Yeah, terrifying.

399
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.260
Okay.

400
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me move this other piece.

401
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Down to attend the part about and I'm assuming the 10. The reason it's down there is you're picturing him in times when he's rescued you from your mother. You can picture him in his hard work ethic, getting up early to me to be a provider for the family is that

402
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:28.500
Alicia Noedel: Right. He was very loving with me. Me and him were best friends.

403
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.310
Alicia Noedel: You know I know he didn't want to hurt me.

404
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.690
Alicia Noedel: You never wanted her

405
00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:41.730
Alicia Noedel: But I knew that he, you know,

406
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:47.490
Alicia Noedel: Maybe he came home at a bad day. Whatever he felt that day.

407
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:50.670
Alicia Noedel: But

408
00:47:52.590 --> 00:48:05.580
Alicia Noedel: You know, I wasn't terrified of him. The way I wasn't terrified of my mom either. It's just, you know, I knew what to expect for my dad. Okay. All right. And my mom was

409
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Say what your mom was again I broke up.

410
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.910
Alicia Noedel: I'm sorry. Someone was calling me unpredictable. I didn't know what was gonna happen from day to day

411
00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we put with mom and her her violent rages and not knowing day to day I've got dad down here at likes a 10 but now when you shift gears. I want to kind of put this these mom pieces. Mommy is cracked bipolar manic depressive snap to the smallest things

412
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:48.420
Alicia Noedel: But it was idol. She, she's you know really messed up like an agent, I'd say like it's 75 or 80 just because of the unpredictability of, you know, you know, not knowing

413
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.910
Alicia Noedel: If I was going to get home from school and she's going to be happy. Not, you know,

414
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, I'm flipping my head because of my ears right

415
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. I said, some people are just got to reassure that it's not

416
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:11.700
Nice.

417
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:13.830
Weird

418
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm sure she would be happy or mad.

419
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The brother stolen thing when he had physically

420
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: kicked you in the stomach and said, Is this what you wanted me to do.

421
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we do it down.

422
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.980
Alicia Noedel: Like a 90

423
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What age were you with that incident.

424
00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:11.580
Alicia Noedel: Like 893 years of like eight, nine and 10 were a lot

425
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So it's that range eight 910

426
00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think we've got a pretty good idea. I think next time. What I'd like to do with you is

427
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be a very closed.

428
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: End and Dr. Which means you notice how one topic. There's all these neural connections in your in your brain where those memories are stored they're connected to a lot, a lot, a lot of memory.

429
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're connected to an emotional right to that amygdala that emotional experience and you're reliving it notice you said that today.

430
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, now

431
00:50:51.660 --> 00:51:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not set in the past. So I want to do some work. If you're up to it next time we meet, when we pick one. And the difference is, we're going to just stick with one of those stories.

432
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.610
Alicia Noedel: Doesn't have to be the worst.

433
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: One can be not as activating one wherever you decide you want to work with. But we're not going to go into these other ones. We're just going to stay right in this until we really hone in

434
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And that that memory itself just has this distance, it feels more in the past as if you're no longer having to relive it and it gets the right timestamp gets put in the past.

435
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. Yeah. All right. Um,

449
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.780

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we just because you're feeling okay now, so maybe it won't be a problem for you to take terror terrified.

453
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And drop that one off.

454

Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture the splash.

455
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Takes a while for it to land and it goes into the rapids.
