00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, okay, we started at 605 I forgot to turn the recording off. But if you and this is for Mr. Corey balls.

2
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:13.889
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Balls. Yes.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:29.460
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Bowls. Okay. But if anything happens in you ever relapse. Don't run from us run to us. Okay. We want you to come with come, keep your appointments, when you haven't good days and when you have a not so good days through thick and thin and okay

4
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, all right, a couple of things I always like to share with my patients before we get started.

5
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.000
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: We were very patient centered. Okay.

6
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:50.370
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: There are three principles I practice under one I'll always be respectful always be honest and always be protective. A lot of questions I asked. I asked the same ones.

7
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.690
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: For example, always asked about alcohol and the use of benzodiazepine was a box on people morphine. The reason I do that.

8
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:13.050
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Because the buprenorphine Suboxone is a very safe medicine, even at high doses, but certain medicines can take that safety off, and you can overdose on the Suboxone okay so it just basically every time we have a one on one, you always get that question for me. Okay.

9
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. All right, then. All right, so I'm gonna pull up my little cheat sheet here we have quite a lot of

10
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:32.580
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Questions. And once again, the questions helped me understand you. And if you ever need to stop me and say, Okay, what's the purpose of that question, have you have a question about a question or something pops in. You don't hesitate to ask me. Okay.

11
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.840
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: All right then.

12
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.030
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So I kind of pull up a flow sheet here. I'm going to try to minimize this a little bit more, you can still see me Corey.

13
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.990
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yes, I can.

14
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:58.050
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Very good. All right, them. Okay, so we have a standard format that we kind of us to make certain that we're dotting all the i's and crossing all the T's now. How young are you 3535 year, young man.

15
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.150
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: All right then.

16
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.230
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay then. Now, are you currently using any drugs.

SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Three. A day I take one in the morning and one a lunch break at work.

22
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.360
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Then come home and we eat. Then I'll take one that. So, about six, seven.

23
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.760
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, are you using a tablet sort of films.

24
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Films. Okay, so it's a box on films in this the eight over to you see the two numbers eight over to

25
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.360
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yes, man.

26
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.430
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And do you do it three times a day.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.480
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Three times a day.

28
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.580
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah okay, three times a day.

29
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.980
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: All right. And how's that working for you.

30
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.450
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Um, it's fine. As soon as, like, Well, I don't know if you want to get into my backstory or not. But I mean,

31
00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:04.650
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I just don't. The feeling of going and buying him off the street, I've been you know jeopardizing everything that I'm trying to build doing this and I just feel terrible. You know, it's

32
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.860
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Adding be heavier going out and doing that. And I want to, I want to get into a program where I'm doing it right and trying to get myself down, you know,

35
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.540
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I got it. So tell me, give me a history about our like what was your main drug of choice.

36
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.800
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay, so we'll wind back to

37
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.890
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I went to college in Pittsburgh played a football and Pittsburgh. I got hurt up there was was prescribed Percocet.

38
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.750
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right now, were you when that happened,

39
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.870
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Right off the jump I was I was 17

40
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.420
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay go from not taking anything to taking that it was like that's at that time. That's they were prescribing everybody there.

41
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.500
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So right

42
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:09.480
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Take these 90 pills and get back out on the field. So I never felt anything like that. And I became addicted to percocet led to oxy cotton.

43
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.200
Okay.

44
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.560
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: And then I was sober for

45
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.470
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I ended up getting sober and

46
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.900
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay.

47
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:30.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Then I had an injury to my knee and I was prescribed Percocet and I wasn't in a good place with my wife and marriage and home life and work, school

48
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.650
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: So I took the prescription. This was 2015 I want to say.

49
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:48.030
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay. Well, I went from percocet to heroin rather fast. Okay. And 2015 16

50
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.410
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: We just started heroin.

51
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.980
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: About 2016

52
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.460
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. And how did you use your hair on one

53
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.830
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: snore it and I did shoot. Yeah.

54
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.640
Okay.

55
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.890
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Then

56
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:13.020
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I ended up going to jail. I got sober in jail. And then I was sober for about a year and a half from everything

57
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.410
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay, and then I almost cut my thumb off at work. I don't know if you if you can see this here. Can you see this here.

58
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I can see that. Uh huh.

59
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.500
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Oh, I went to the ER and they were prescribing me wanted to give me Percocet. And I said, no, because I had been down this path before

60
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:37.800
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Right. Oh, but immediately my attic. My or whatever you want to say I started thinking Suboxone will work Suboxone will work. So

61
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:51.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Then I went and got Suboxone illegally off the street, and that's kind of how am I Suboxone us started. And luckily I've been able to just, I just use them, but this is where I'm at now, you know,

62
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.690
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you started the Suboxone at the hand injury was that around 2018 or

63
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.050
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: 2008 2019 yeah

64
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.710
Okay.

65
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.400
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I you treat it paints a box on

66
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.470
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Correct. Okay.

67
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.540
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Then it her for a long time and

68
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.900
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: You know, I was taking that and eventually at some point the pain wasn't there anymore and and the physical addiction was and

69
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.070
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I didn't really think about it, or I didn't like stop.

70
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:32.580
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Taking it and then feel it like the withdrawals. I just kept going, you know, and here and here and here I am.

71
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:46.560
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: OK. OK, so for the transcription is I'll just go ahead and kind of summarize what will need to have. So you're 35 year old male you're currently taking the Suboxone film off the street eight over two, three times a day.

72
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.660
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And

73
00:06:49.890 --> 00:07:01.260
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You fill in fine on it. But you, you just don't like getting it off the street, and so your drug use history started playing college after an injury you prescribed

74
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:13.590
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: 2000 to 817 years old. Okay. And then from Percocet, you use oxy cotton and you got sober in 2011 then you had another injury to uni and

75
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:23.640
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Prescribed Percocet and then this advanced you started using heroin in 2016 you use it by snorting and injecting

76
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.400
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You became sober while you were in jail.

77
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.020
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You were so before about 1.5 years you had a hand injury and

78
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:42.960
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And you really did not want to do anything that will compromise your sobriety. So you treat it your pain with the Suboxone and

79
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.780
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Even though the pain and the hand left

80
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.450
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You knew that the addiction was there.

81
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.320
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very succinct.

82
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.470
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Where's your last dose of Suboxone

83
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.760
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I took one this a lunch break. So like 1230

84
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.810
Okay.

85
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.410
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, what's 1230 today.

86
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.130
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yes. Okay. Um,

87
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:15.000
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And how do you know that you, you have a dependence on the Suboxone what happens without Suboxone

88
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:25.470
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Well, I get agitated tired yawning yawning. And honestly, sometimes I think it helps me like

89
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.230
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I got a lot going on and

90
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:40.950
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Sometimes I think maybe it helps me refocus on like just work. And now what's going on in my life. Or like, you know what I mean. Does that make sense.

91
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.300
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It does. Now, have you ever been on in less than 24 milligrams a day.

92
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.350
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah, what

93
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:59.370
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I worked my way up to that. I don't know how long it's been since I've been taking three but um yeah I definitely worked my way up to it over almost a year, year, a year, year and a half.

94
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:08.820
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Do you think get you worked out because you haven't tolerance, because you felt like there was a greater need to deal with withdraw to deal with the cravings.

95
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:19.680
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Um, I think so. Yeah, that too. And another thing was is I didn't want. Um, I would just take the whole one because I didn't want a little pieces with my kids laying around them things

96
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:32.190
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I just was picking the whole thing. I didn't want little there's laying around or getting lost, or in my pocket. And so that's how I would start taking the whole thing. And then I'd say um

97
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:39.450
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I don't know why I was taking more probably to try to get a little high feeling, you know, probably what it was.

98
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.520
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Does it make you high

99
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.780
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: On the mountain.

100
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.750
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: No, not now, but I think then at that point I was probably I probably was chasing it you know

101
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.020
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. How long have you been on taking a 24 milligrams

102
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.100
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Probably I'd say three, four months maybe

103
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.650
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right 3424 milligrams a day 10 foot three to four months.

104
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.610
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah. Okay. Have you tried to do a 60 milligrams in that time.

105
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.990
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: No. No. Okay.

106
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:16.530
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And how do you feel on a 24 milligrams. Do you feel like you. Do you feel like, do you mean, does it make you fatigue. How does the 20

107
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.230
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: milligram open. It makes me feel fine. Like, I mean, I get fatigued and tired. If

108
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:35.250
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I got in late adults. You know what I mean like if I if for some reason on lunch break. So I gotta hide it at like launch. You know I gotta figure out somewhere to go, which also makes me feel like shit.

109
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:42.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay. But yeah, if I do if I do miss it. I noticed like I'll feel tired or, you know,

110
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.130
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Without so

111
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.180
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: You're saying are good.

112
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:55.320
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: In terms of timing. Do you have you been spending a lot of time trying to get the Suboxone off the street. He can be

113
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.520
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah yeah

114
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.250
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: So it's not just that, that the biggest factor is, you know,

115
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.310
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: A getting in trouble. You know, it's

116
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.320
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Just everything I've been through put my family through it. Be like such a slap in their face.

117
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.340
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right.

118
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.300
To like

119
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:23.490
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Because my kids were used to me leaving and not coming back. You know, so like if I were to go out and buy him. Then I get arrested and it's

120
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right concerned about being a rest. Right. Well, that makes perfect sense.

121
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.540
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: It's a big stress. Yeah.

Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay, right.

134
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.910

SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah, I've lost everything.

136
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:06.450

SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah yeah

138
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.610
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Same. Some people really do some turn around. Yeah.

139
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.870
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So that may make it

140
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:19.830
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Yeah, I did it when I got sober in 2010. I mean, I went from like I've done it before, but it's

141
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.170
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Like this time I was so cocky and arrogant.

142
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:29.730
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Before like all this little prescription isn't gonna, you know, I have something wrong with me. This is going to be fine.

143
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:44.910
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Nine know like, that's why I went to the sandbox is I never really tried, I tried Suboxone like to get off a heroin, but I never really gave it a full on a chance, you know,

144
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:52.890
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Right, so it was like, Yeah, but I didn't know I can't. So that's why I went to the Suboxone because it's a maintenance, it's not

145
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.020
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: You know, some maintenance. True.

146
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.820
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So what did you learn from that experience when you decided to do to Suboxone

147
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.640
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: That instead of going to the person

148
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:12.420
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Mm hmm. When the dot. When the ER doctor said that I learned that maybe I had turned a corner I do realize like, this is stronger than me and

149
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:18.690
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: If I do take a Percocet, or biking and I could be back up and running again.

150
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.690
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Often like that and lose everything.

151
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:29.250
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: That's good. Yeah. Yeah, but you know something, I find that the people who do best and the programs are the ones who

152
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:43.470
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Have the sense of humility that I hear that you're saying, you know, and humility doesn't mean weaknesses, Ashley me strength. You know what you need and you're willing to humble yourself and say at this point in my life. This is what I need. Yeah.

SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Right.

154
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.180
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: And that's what you know.

155
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.630
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And wisdom I hear wisdom to okay

156
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I do feel like, you know,

157
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:59.670
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I want to say it was just like the Suboxone you don't I at least know get high office. So it's like

158
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:06.150
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: But it's like, I don't know if I'm using as a as a crutch, but it's like

159
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.890
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: I just know if I'm on this ain't gonna be on that one. I mean,

160
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.610
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You know what you're saying two Koreas. What

161
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:25.770
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: We're seeing its, its protective and them the medicine binds to the opiate receptor stronger than a lot of the medicines that can overdose and kill people.

162
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:47.610
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And so its protective and, in general, we do see that people are living longer, he helps people to live. So it sounds like physically and intuitively you've picked up on it as being a safer option for you. And that's what we see two. Okay, okay that's wisdom. Um, have you, have you ever overdosed.

163
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.600
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: You know, I think I might have, but there was like one. One time I was in high in the car.

164
00:15:54.930 --> 00:16:04.920
SAMSUNG-SM-T807V: Okay. Back in 16 and I woke up like you know 15 minutes later, but I don't. I never went to the hospital or an hour can or something like that.

169
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.110
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: But I've had a lot of patients save lives because they had an arc and on
