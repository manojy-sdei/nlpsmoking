27
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.490
christa Barker: And then this morning, my SD card was corrupt and I had to redo it.

28
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.360

30
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.940

32
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.420

christa Barker: Yes, I am.

36
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.640
Natalie Austin: Now, did you have treatment before

37
00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:03.660
christa Barker: Yes, I've been doing treatment, often on for five years and I was diagnosed with lupus. When I was 25 and I was on pain medicine and then they

38
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:22.110
christa Barker: You know recommended Suboxone switch me over at that time. None of this was available, your family doctor can prescribe it, things like that. So he is getting a little, little better with, you know, the Suboxone clinics and help fanatics and stuff. I think it's getting

39
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.080
Natalie Austin: Slowly, it's very slow.

40
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.090
Natalie Austin: Yeah yeah

41
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.370
christa Barker: It is real slow and it's it's like the leading cause of death in America, like it really needs to be

42
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.570
Natalie Austin: Here think yeah

43
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.350
Natalie Austin: I think most of us educating people you know a lot of people like pharmacists don't understand it and

44
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.940
christa Barker: As

45
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.170
Natalie Austin: A lot of good advice that

46
00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:01.560
christa Barker: Yeah, I think the education has a lot to do with the two I was shot and my new what happened was I was at a clinic in Iron Curtain and

47
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:17.580
christa Barker: She I woke up and it was a snowstorm. I live way out in the country. I'm raising kids and my grandkids and I can't, like, go in all the time and she put me on a daily dose. I've never had to deal with that.

48
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.060
christa Barker: Was of non compliant with a group. Yes.

49
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.840
Natalie Austin: Oh my gosh.

50
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:32.670
christa Barker: Yes. When I got compliant her thing was, well, you're going to say on daily dose until you get the marijuana out of your system and the prescribed like surreal.

51
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.750
christa Barker: I said, No, I'm not. I'm finding another clinic for you.

52
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:50.790
christa Barker: That's been down this online. And I was like, this is perfect. Not only is our county and city riddled with methamphetamines that they're smoking meth out front of the clinic, while I'm waiting to see the doctor.

53
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.030
Natalie Austin: Like

54
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.140
Natalie Austin: I don't want that.

55
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.250

56
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.460
christa Barker: Yeah.

57
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.030
Natalie Austin: I'll see you went to a methadone clinic.

58
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.580
christa Barker: Know is the Suboxone clinic.

59
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.240
Natalie Austin: Was it

60
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.110
christa Barker: Yep.

61
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.970
Natalie Austin: So I know methadone is daily. I didn't realize I could do Suboxone day. Oh yeah, that's crazy.

62
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.430
christa Barker: Though what she made me do was go to

63
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:29.760
christa Barker: I had to check in there every morning and then I had to go to the pharmacy to get two pills and then go back and those rubber, which was okay except for our town Rite Aid and CBS or the main pharmacies and Rite Aid isn't taken insurance anymore except for one, you know, I did.

64
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.640
christa Barker: And vs was taken three hours to fill the prescription. I was in there, three hours every day to do that.

Natalie Austin: Whenever you get it. Let us know and we'll make a copy of it for your chart. Okay.

80
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.870

84
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:56.490
christa Barker: Yeah, I just wanted to be honest with you and let you know in the black surreal. I don't take it a lot because, well, the way it was prescribed was for like

85
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.660
christa Barker: The leg things so I don't feel like I should have to be on it.

86
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.620
christa Barker: Every day.

87
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.580
Right.

88
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.860
Natalie Austin: What is it

89
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.900
Natalie Austin: It was

90
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.050
Natalie Austin: Yeah, three times a day.

91
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.030
Natalie Austin: Yeah, okay.

92
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.020
Natalie Austin: Now. No, that's okay. You're allowed to be on it. Tell me.

93
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.890
Natalie Austin: What can you tell the pharmacist, the pharmacist also get

94
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.880
christa Barker: My counselor.

95
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.450
Know my

96
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.190
christa Barker: Work.

97
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:29.820
christa Barker: That, you know, and then she mentioned in a group that her drug and alcohol part had lapsed, and she was waiting to get

98
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:37.920
christa Barker: It renewed. I didn't think she was allowed to be my counselor if she didn't have the drug and alcohol or whatever. So I just

99
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.700
Natalie Austin: Decided that Sylvania, I think you do. I mean, in Ohio. I think you do need that.

100
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.900
christa Barker: Yeah. Yep.

101
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.790
Natalie Austin: Right.

102
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.520
Natalie Austin: Um,

103
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.790
Natalie Austin: So how long even going to that that clinic where you had to do that three hour thing, how long

104
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.800
christa Barker: I've been gone to that clinic for a few months, the doctor was excellent. He didn't care about the marijuana

105
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:16.950
christa Barker: And he knew my plans. I've been on the waiting list for a couple months now that he knew the plans to get in there. So he didn't gripe about it and they switched companies, I guess it was pinnacle, and then they turned into attend

106
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.090
Okay.

107
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:28.110
Natalie Austin: Now, we don't really have a problem with either because it's actually you can be on medical marijuana for for opioid opioid use disorder. Did you know that

108
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.790
christa Barker: Yes.

109
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.600
Natalie Austin: I brought out it

110
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.740
Natalie Austin: Yeah. So yeah, you're able to get on that no issues.

111
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.620
Natalie Austin: So, I mean, we don't make a big gripe about that is like we do.

112
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.820
christa Barker: With a pencil.

113
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:52.500
christa Barker: Yes, yes. I mean, I could see that there's other things more harmful and there seems like those things are easier to get nowadays than marijuana, you know. Yeah.

114
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:52.800
Natalie Austin: Like

115
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:59.190
christa Barker: Like the methamphetamines and the heroin and that's I've never done heroin meth.

116
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.050
So,

117
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:10.290

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:41.640
christa Barker: When I went to star, the program. She thought I was getting going to get clean on she realized they were stealing her stuff because it was still kind of missing you know

140
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:56.730
christa Barker: So that's when she figured out it wasn't me doing that, you know, I wasn't the one that had that big of an issue. I did, but I knew I had a problem and I knew I needed help, there should have been a better way to go about it.

141
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.670
Natalie Austin: Right, my stars. It's crazy.

142
