00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:19.770
Dawn Abriel: It is March 16 2020 and this will be the intake for see if I can find her name.

2
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.500
Dawn Abriel: Suzanne Grossman.

3
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.550
Dawn Abriel: Go ahead and get started with her chart.

4
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.180
Dawn Abriel: Your Suzanne.

5
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.620
Suzanne Grossman: Suzanne Grossman.

6
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.810
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'm Dr. Rob real

7
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.220
Suzanne Grossman: Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.980
Dawn Abriel: You too. So I was just looking at the one of the assessments that you did.

9
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.810
Dawn Abriel: And

10
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.260
Dawn Abriel: It looks like there's a lot of anxiety and

11
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
Dawn Abriel: Depression going on is that what is true for you.

12
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.910
Suzanne Grossman: That's because I have chronic pancreatitis, and we're trying to save my life right now.

13
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.780
Suzanne Grossman: So it's pretty normal.

14
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.870
Dawn Abriel: OK, so

15
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.150
Dawn Abriel: The depression is from the chronic disease. It's not from wishing you weren't on the planet anymore.

16
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.500
Suzanne Grossman: No, it's because they're failing me right now and it's been four and a half years. So the latest suggestion.

17
00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:04.440
Suzanne Grossman: Was I asked my doctor for referrals to Krista St. Vincent and Santa Fe, the Mayo Clinic in Arizona doesn't take Presbyterian Centennial

18
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:19.590
Suzanne Grossman: So I did get in last Thursday. She said that I should try Suboxone and we're going to do an endoscopy where you go in and you douse the pancreas alcohol.

19
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:35.250
Suzanne Grossman: And It numbs the nerves for up to a month. So she's thinking that since I've been on opioids for, you know, four years of the four and a half and we keep increasing the dosage and I don't like it.

20
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.170
Suzanne Grossman: So,

21
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.570
Suzanne Grossman: She thinks I might have something called hyper hyper galena.

22
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.260
Dawn Abriel: Guys, yeah.

23
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.030
Suzanne Grossman: That's it, yeah.

24
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.530
Suzanne Grossman: I've got some paper.

25
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.110
Dawn Abriel: If she explained that to you.

26
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.300
Suzanne Grossman: Yes. And then I Googled

27
00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:04.350
Suzanne Grossman: I've been up since 230 Googling so box to box own and I did a live chat with some government woman 230 in the morning, who told me it's addictive, which I didn't know

28
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.730
Dawn Abriel: Well, look, your you would be substituting a short acting opioid with a long acting opioids.

29
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.460
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so they're both opioids.

30
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.750
Okay.

31
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.570
Dawn Abriel: So, yes.

32
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.040
Dawn Abriel: You want to do would go through withdrawal. If you stop taking the buprenorphine.

33
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.420
Okay.

34
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:41.880
Suzanne Grossman: Well, I do want to do this because this is what was suggested, and then I called casement behavioral health on Wyoming and they suggested brighter heart. And that's how we got this going. And so I

35
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.120
Suzanne Grossman: I sent Natalie have luck.

36
00:03:46.260 --> 00:04:06.660
Suzanne Grossman: On Saturday morning the office was closed. But I sent her a note via the new patient portal that the referral. She gave me for a sec with UNAM which is alcohol substance abuse that I wanted to go with you again for your name and bright heart health.

37
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.770
Suzanne Grossman: So hopefully, she's got it this morning.

38
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.980
Suzanne Grossman: But that's our new game plan.

39
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.020
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so

40
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.310
Dawn Abriel: So the this is more of a physical dependence, rather than an addiction.

41
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.400
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, if I don't take it, then I start getting sick because I haven't taken it.

42
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:39.210
Suzanne Grossman: Regular days I'm not in pain from my pancreas, and I don't want that opioid but then I have to take it because I'm addicted. Right. Oh.

43
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.430
Dawn Abriel: Well, so let's be clear about something. There's a difference between addiction and physical dependence. Okay.

44
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980
Dawn Abriel: Addiction is when you take a substance.

45
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.470
Dawn Abriel: Knowing that it's really bad for you, and you don't care about the consequences.

46
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.870
Dawn Abriel: You know, there will be negative consequences and you do it anyway. That's addiction.

47
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.470
Dawn Abriel: physical dependence means your body, your chemistry.

48
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:17.160
Dawn Abriel: Has gotten so used to having a large amount of this chemical present that it signals withdrawal when when it's not around. Yes. Okay, so that

49
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.270
The capillaries.

50
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.130
Dawn Abriel: Important

51
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.620
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, I did they

52
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.720
Dawn Abriel: Did they tell you that we have a pain doctor with right heart health.

53
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:41.130
Suzanne Grossman: Know, I started this once. Karen at kaseman. All I got was her first name. I've been a patient of kaseman for over a decade, I go with Dr. Pierre

54
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:55.290
Suzanne Grossman: And that day I got a woman and Karen. I've never spoken to, and she told me about this bright heart. And she said, for what I'm going through this is what I need to do video conferencing.

55
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.760
Dawn Abriel: Okay so we are mostly an addiction program. We help people who

56
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:13.950
Dawn Abriel: Are, you know, had a pain problem and stayed on the medicine and and found that they just didn't have to face life they got to numb out, they didn't

57
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:24.060
Dawn Abriel: They really didn't have to progress in their emotional well being, because they were numbed out with every life problem so

58
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:34.110
Dawn Abriel: And then decided that maybe they would like to see what life is like without being on opioids. So that's mostly what we do.

59
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:47.400
Dawn Abriel: We do some alcohol methamphetamine. And there are a few people who are like really pretty pure pain and

60
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:56.010
Dawn Abriel: I like to put them in a particular time slot so that you guys are all together. So are you working

61
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.300
Suzanne Grossman: No, I haven't worked since 2005

62
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.620
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so would you be able to meet Wednesdays at 130

63
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.290
Suzanne Grossman: Yes, I'm OK.

64
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.490
Dawn Abriel: So the way this would work is

65
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:30.120
Dawn Abriel: You would come to a group with me and a woman a therapist named Dominique one week. The next week, you would go with Dr. Jackson. The next week me the next week. Jackson, you would just alternate

66
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.320
Okay.

67
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.890
Suzanne Grossman: Is this via what we're doing now.

68
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.860
Dawn Abriel: Yep. Everything's done on computer

69
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.990
Dawn Abriel: You do not have to leave the house.

70
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.370
Dawn Abriel: And given these times, it's really handy.

71
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.120
Suzanne Grossman: Yes, it is. I don't even want to talk about these times.

72
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.220
Suzanne Grossman: Or yeah really yeah so

73
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.600
Dawn Abriel: Let me go through my little spiel here. Are you living in Albuquerque.

74
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.680
Suzanne Grossman: I live in San Diego park outside of Albuquerque. Okay.

75
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.680
Suzanne Grossman: By the ski area.

76
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.690
Suzanne Grossman: Did you are an Albuquerque. Right.

77
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.330
Dawn Abriel: No, I, I live in Santa Fe, but

78
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.110
OK.

79
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.900
Dawn Abriel: OK, so your, your last dose of opioid was this morning.

80
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.560
Suzanne Grossman: Yes.

81
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.150
Dawn Abriel: And how much

82
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.020
Suzanne Grossman: It was 8am. It was 30 milligram

83
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.380
Dawn Abriel: And you take that three times a day.

84
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.550
Yes.

85
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.530
Dawn Abriel: And you've never done IV drugs.

86
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.520
No.

87
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.980
Dawn Abriel: But the tolerance independence.

88
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.720
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

89
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.980
Dawn Abriel: Chronic

90
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.900
Dawn Abriel: Disease.

91
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.420
Dawn Abriel: Any overdoses medical problems or legal issues related to

92
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.350
Now,

93
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.790
Dawn Abriel: And I'm guessing that you're. This is all been prescription. So your life hasn't turned into how to get the drug, thinking about the drugs.

94
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.220
Suzanne Grossman: Um, it hasn't yet, but it's gonna be that way. If I can't

95
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.170
Suzanne Grossman: Do this. I mean, I really want to try this.

96
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.670
Suzanne Grossman: No.

97
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:39.780
Suzanne Grossman: I'm a, I'm a very reclusive person I live alone I'm up in the mountain. And I'm very close to my family. And that's it. I really don't have a social life. So for me to go out and try to find something would be extremely hard, I'd have to really put some effort in there.

98
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.160
Dawn Abriel: Have you done any illicit drugs. Did you smoke marijuana when you were a kid or

99
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.170
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, when I was a kid.

100
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.610
Dawn Abriel: Like how old

101
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.700
Suzanne Grossman: 16 years old.

102
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.990
Suzanne Grossman: Out in Denver, Colorado, little high school trying to be cool.

103
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.730
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, I'm not good with

104
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.690
Marijuana

105
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.940
Dawn Abriel: So,

106
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.320
Dawn Abriel: How long did that period last

107
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:15.270
Suzanne Grossman: It was very brief like I tried it a few times now I have my medical marijuana card and

108
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:30.600
Suzanne Grossman: You know, I bought a bunch of medical marijuana and I don't enjoy it. It doesn't seem to help, but anything it's sometimes, it increases the pancreas pain because it's a deep. Yeah, it's not. I have my card. I don't use it that often.

109
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.670
Suzanne Grossman: It's like a security blanket and I don't know why I'm holding on to it because it doesn't work for me.

110
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.840
Dawn Abriel: Now, and

111
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:45.330
Dawn Abriel: And you specifically found a preparation that was meant for pain.

112
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:54.660
Dawn Abriel: Because not all prefer not all plant species of marijuana are will address pain.

113
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.850
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, we've been through all of this.

114
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.250
Suzanne Grossman: I got hard. Yeah, we're good.

115
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.020
Dawn Abriel: Do you have sleep and anxiety will use, you do have those

116
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.650
Yes.

117
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:15.660
Dawn Abriel: So one of the things that opioids really mess with your brain, whether you take it for pain or take it recreationally it messes with your brain.

118
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.810
Dawn Abriel: Yes. So have you ever been hospitalized for mental health issue.

119
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.330
Suzanne Grossman: It's

120
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:33.090
Suzanne Grossman: Not an overnight stay but yes I so many years ago, probably 2006

121
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.970
Dawn Abriel: And what was that for

122
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:51.120
Suzanne Grossman: Depression, and it was just a brief man I was extremely depressed and I called him, I said, I want to offer myself and we were there was, there may be six hours that kaseman and that was it.

123
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.740
Suzanne Grossman: So,

124
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.170
Dawn Abriel: And you got lined up with the therapist or

125
00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.570
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, I've been with casement behavioral health for well over a decade.

126
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.450
Suzanne Grossman: I'm secure with my therapist.

127
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:25.470
Dawn Abriel: Okay, you, you will have to get a bio psychosocial by one of our therapists, but that's just to be in the program. You can stay with your own therapist.

128
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:36.660
Dawn Abriel: We don't have to. It's really probably not a good idea to have more than one therapist. Anyway, so we try to honor that. What would you say your self esteem is like right now.

129
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.540
Suzanne Grossman: It's pretty low. Just because I mean I was a size 12 and zero.

130
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.600
Dawn Abriel: And your stress level.

131
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.430
Suzanne Grossman: Is high

132
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.980
Suzanne Grossman: But in an eight out of 10

133
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.180
Dawn Abriel: Alright, so

134
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:16.890
Dawn Abriel: Let's go to the past medical history, and I will put in. Let's see. This is there a pancreatitis already here. Yeah. And so the pancreatitis was brought on by what

135
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.170
Dawn Abriel: Alcoholism okay

136
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.290
Dawn Abriel: And when did that start with the diagnosis.

137
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.620
Suzanne Grossman: November 2015 okay

138
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.500
Dawn Abriel: So I'm going to read a whole long list of things just stop me if any of them apply to you. Okay.

139
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.550
Suzanne Grossman: Mm hmm.

140
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.320
Dawn Abriel: Do you know what your blood type is

141
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.140
Suzanne Grossman: No. Okay.

142
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:53.040
Dawn Abriel: Any head trauma I ear, nose or throat difficulties any breathing problems with chronic asthma pneumonias. Do you have any muscle joint bone problems.

143
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.110
Dawn Abriel: I don't, I really do all

144
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:07.710
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah don't include any withdrawal symptoms. Okay. No, they don't count diabetes, anemia, cancer, HIV sexually transmitted diseases or tested positive for tuberculosis.

145
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:19.890
Dawn Abriel: New skin problems with rashes new moles epilepsy, seizures, to be your headaches stroke bipolar, we will put depression and when did the depression start

146
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.240
Suzanne Grossman: When I was a teenager probably okay.

147
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.850
Suzanne Grossman: And then it goes away and I was fine. And now I'm sick, so it's back. Okay.

148
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:38.070
Dawn Abriel: No hallucinations or delusions and there was suicidal thoughts and one suicide attempt. When you were

149
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.830
Suzanne Grossman: In like 2006

150
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:42.660

Suzanne Grossman: Thing, they should be 26,000 look at that as a single pill 26

338

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:57.900
Dawn Abriel: I don't know if it's all that important. I'm going to just put one in there and if it ever becomes an issue or anything else.

342
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.600
Suzanne Grossman: Let's see, we got the Nigeria enzyme, the opioid

343
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.150
Suzanne Grossman: It's pretty much. That's it for what I've got myself down to

344
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:10.200
Dawn Abriel: Great.

345
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.990
Dawn Abriel: And do you have any allergies to medicines.

346
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:23.160
Suzanne Grossman: Well not anymore. At first you know the opioids very so sick. I thought I was allergic. And then after so long. I JUST ADJUSTED

347
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:38.430
Dawn Abriel: And you bathe yourself dress yourself feed yourself. Go to the bathroom by yourself and go from one place to another by yourself.

348
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:52.620
Dawn Abriel: You know who you are, where you are, what time it is. You make your own decisions you have memory that's normal for your age, you can direct your attention and you can read. Yes, I assume. All right.

349
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.070
Dawn Abriel: Do you know how to get your pulse.

350
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.640
Suzanne Grossman: I haven't been a long time.

351
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.840
Suzanne Grossman: But yes, I can do.

352
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:01.560
Dawn Abriel: Let me show you.

353
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:09.000
Dawn Abriel: You have a muscle that goes from your jaw down to your sternum. If you feel just in front of it.

354
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.380
Dawn Abriel: Got it. Okay, I'll tell you when to start counting. Hold on.

355
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.470
Dawn Abriel: Now,

356
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:25.980
Dawn Abriel: Stop.

357
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.310
Dawn Abriel: What number

358
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.300
Seven.

359
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.620
Dawn Abriel: And how tall are you,

360
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.060
Suzanne Grossman: Five one

361
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.850
Dawn Abriel: And your current weight.

362
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:51.570
Suzanne Grossman: I checked in at an even 100 on Thursday. So let's keep it at that because I was 92 just a few days before. Yeah.

363
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.190
Dawn Abriel: You're right on the edge.

364
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.650
Dawn Abriel: Night.

365
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.460
Dawn Abriel: He made it

366
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:58.350
Suzanne Grossman: I'm sorry.

367
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:06.960
Dawn Abriel: Your, your BMI is 18.89 and we consider it severely underweight when people are

368
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.060
Dawn Abriel: Under 19

369
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.800
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, well I got my weight up to 100

370
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.130
Suzanne Grossman: Lately it's hard for me to maintain even a 96 but I'm trying really hard.

371
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:30.330
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so now we need to do a little physical exam. So come real close to the camera and pull your eyelid down so I can see under your eyelid.

372
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.240
Suzanne Grossman: My doing it.

373
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.660
Dawn Abriel: Yes. Okay. Relax, let go pull back.

374
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.280
Dawn Abriel: Make your eyes go all the way to the right.

375
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.440
Dawn Abriel: Left.

376
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.180
Dawn Abriel: Up.

377
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.070
Dawn Abriel: And down.

378
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.130
Dawn Abriel: Breathe out of either side of your nose.

379
00:32:55.290 --> 00:33:00.660
Dawn Abriel: Okay, open your mouth really wide and stick your tongue out at me. Move it side to side.

380
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:07.830
Dawn Abriel: Okay Close your mouth bite down your teeth fit. Normally, and you have no job pain.

381
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.730
Dawn Abriel: Now, great. Let me see you swallow.

382
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:20.610
Dawn Abriel: Okay, can you move the camera down just a little bit. Yeah. And let me see you take a deep breath.

383
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:28.560
Dawn Abriel: Super and bring your chin to shoulder both sides.

384
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.480
Dawn Abriel: And ear to shoulder

385
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.470
Dawn Abriel: Back.

386
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.890
Dawn Abriel: Back in front. Yes. So did mine because I was showing you

387
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.470
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, okay.

388
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.060
Dawn Abriel: And

389
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:53.580
Dawn Abriel: Let's see, self patient. So when you press on your belly. Where do you notice pain.

390
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:54.450
Suzanne Grossman: Right here.

391
00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:02.340
Suzanne Grossman: It's right on the left, below the beginning of your sternum, or your pancreas says

392
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.200
Suzanne Grossman: It's right there.

393
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.330
Dawn Abriel: And are there any masses in there. It's just paying

394
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.560
Suzanne Grossman: It's painting. It's swollen, because the pancreas doesn't something nowadays.

395
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:28.380
Suzanne Grossman: Like my posture has suffered because I'm always leaning forward because the pain actually makes you double over

396
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.840
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah now trying to keep alert with this. Sit up straight, but I always end up

397
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.940
Suzanne Grossman: My own do

398
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.740
Dawn Abriel: You have any tattoos.

399
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:45.570
Suzanne Grossman: I have one on my left shoulder. When I was 19 and it's a blur of a lion now.

400
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.560
Dawn Abriel: Let me see you touch your fingers to your thumb.

401
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.810
Dawn Abriel: Both sides.

402
00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:04.080
Dawn Abriel: Okay and prop the camera camera up and I want to see you pull your against your fingers.

403
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:05.820
Suzanne Grossman: Okay.

404
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.100
Suzanne Grossman: Am I gonna put you

405
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.490
Suzanne Grossman: You're gonna get a little bit

406
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:13.770
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

407
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.500
Suzanne Grossman: Just like pool.

408
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.530
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, no pain or discomfort when you do that.

409
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.460
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah.

410
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.110
Dawn Abriel: Griffin. Okay, now take the camera down and let me see your ankles.

411
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.120
Suzanne Grossman: Like, take my socks off.

412
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.170
Dawn Abriel: Well, if you can just push them down so I can see

413
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.890
Some of your

414
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.750
Suzanne Grossman: Mistakes. I can't tell if you can see

415
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.000
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I can. That's great. Thank you.

416
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.590
Dawn Abriel: Okay, perfect. Okay, so let's talk about the program.

417
00:35:53.370 --> 00:36:04.950
Dawn Abriel: Thank you. Do you do have to go. You might want to write. I'm going to send you an email that has a lot of this information saved the email because it has the important numbers on it for you.

418
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:18.900
Dawn Abriel: You have to go get labs drawn. I need unless you've had like labs within the last couple of months. You can have them faxed over to bright heart health, but I do need to see what your, your liver is up to.

419
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:19.830
Okay.

420
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:28.350
Dawn Abriel: I give what are called E prescriptions electronic you'll never have a piece of paper to deal with.

421
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.650
Suzanne Grossman: My dog has to that. Yeah, my primary

422
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.040
Dawn Abriel: Care.

423
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:38.340
Dawn Abriel: And you have to tell the pharmacist, you know, you'll call ahead and say, Is my E prescription ready

424
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.450
Dawn Abriel: Okay and I caution people

425
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:55.590
Dawn Abriel: There seems to be a lot of mistakes that are made that as you're at the counter, you have the tech or the pharmacist open the package before they hand it to you.

426
00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:13.200
Dawn Abriel: And check that it's the right dose in the right amount and the right form. So once you touch the package. By law they are not allowed to take it back no matter what they will not take it back. See, you're stuck with ever whatever medicine. You're on.

427
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:30.030
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, that's actually a simple thing. And I had them start counting my opioids, because there was a couple of times where one was missing. Just, just one. Yep. Yeah, so I switched pharmacies, because one kept missing.

428
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.940
Dawn Abriel: Yep, that's some some pharmacist is addicted to the opioid that

429
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.160
Dawn Abriel: You're shorting you yeah

430
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.870
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I'm

431
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.530
Suzanne Grossman: One.

432
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.530
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to start you on the film and they're nasty tasting things

433
00:37:47.670 --> 00:38:00.240
Dawn Abriel: I've had all my patients tell me. We've tried every single brand on the market. They all taste nasty. So don't think you can try another brand and have a taste better, because they're all nasty.

434
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.230
Um,

435
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:12.450
Dawn Abriel: So you you have to put it under your tongue, but you should absolutely no smoking at least a half an hour before you take your medicine.

436
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:16.590
Dawn Abriel: Because you're counting on the blood vessels under your tongue.

437
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:33.360
Dawn Abriel: To absorb the medicine and smoking causes all of your blood vessels all over your body to cramp down. That's why it's so dangerous for heart disease and stroke and kidney problems because of that cramping down so

438
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.680
Suzanne Grossman: Out of you. Good to know.

439
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:46.230
Dawn Abriel: You've got to have those vessels widened up and ready to take the medicine takes about two minutes for to fully dissolve and get in your system.

440
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:55.740
Dawn Abriel: You know 15 minutes later, you can really rinse your mouth. It is important, all opioids cause dry mouth.

441
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.390
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah yeah

442
00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:11.640
Dawn Abriel: And that dryness puts your teeth and gums at high risk for disease. I have a person who recently was telling me about her all her teeth were really loose and she was on a really low dose.

443
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:19.200
Dawn Abriel: So I looked it up and it is a very common problem. It's not as common as people who take methamphetamine.

444
00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:33.450
Dawn Abriel: You know, that's a very particular they get so dried out that they they lose their teeth, they get very decayed, but it still happens with people on opioids. So I caution you to really take your oral hygiene.

445
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.310
Dawn Abriel: I seriously.

446
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:48.270
Suzanne Grossman: my gums are bleeding and I knew it was opioids and then my eyes. I got cataracts already and I talked to the eye doctor and he said, it might be the opioid I'm only 47

447
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.910
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah.

448
00:39:52.470 --> 00:40:01.950
Dawn Abriel: And once a month you'll have to do a urine drug screen. And what that entails is you will receive this in the mail a manila envelope.

449
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.690
Dawn Abriel: And when you get it.

450
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:16.110
Dawn Abriel: Do not open it. If you open it, they won't use it, they'll have to send you to a lab. So don't open the package. You go to the virtual clinic and say, what do I do with this.

451
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:37.260
Dawn Abriel: And they will tell you to open it in front of them and then take out this and it has a year and cup in it will open this go to the bathroom, come back and you'll take the urine cup and hold it up to the camera and very slowly turn it and it will read the results up in northern sample.

452
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.790
Dawn Abriel: God so

453
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.450
Dawn Abriel: If you

454
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:57.390
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it is easy. Much better than going to a lab. If you don't get a hearing cup within a month. Make sure you contact the virtual clinic and say something's wrong with my address and have them check it, it's up to you to make sure you get your urine, a

455
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.090
Suzanne Grossman: Proactive your. Yes, yes.

456
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.080
Dawn Abriel: Okay, you got good

457
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:14.400
Dawn Abriel: And I have to send you a prescription of Narcan by law. Everyone gets some Narcan when they get an opioid prescription. So just have it around handy.

458
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:28.380
Dawn Abriel: When you, when you come to group. There are some very specific requirements, what you have right now is perfect. You have lighting where I can see your facial expressions.

459
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:36.300
Dawn Abriel: Okay, and you live alone. So this isn't an issue but there absolutely cannot be anyone in the room with you.

460
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:47.310
Dawn Abriel: Guys can imagine if someone accidentally snooze someone that you're looking at. They can see someone in there in your group that they know that would just be horrible.

461
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:49.020
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, you got it.

462
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.240
Dawn Abriel: Extreme have to do. Yeah.

463
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:57.240
Dawn Abriel: You have to do a brief addiction monitor before every group.

464
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.400
Dawn Abriel: Okay, now that's a

465
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.650
Dawn Abriel: It's questions that so I can follow

466
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.310
Dawn Abriel: Problems that you can always talk about in group.

467
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:17.310
Dawn Abriel: Oh, so you're going to be required to do a pain scale every week. So the pain doctor can keep track of loops.

468
00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.260
Dawn Abriel: I lost your bud.

469
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.120
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, I'm here.

470
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.750
Dawn Abriel: I can't find it.

471
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.630
Suzanne Grossman: I'm look left and maybe it went down under the desk or towards the chair.

472
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.830
Suzanne Grossman: I thought it popped to your left.

473
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:48.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's right. Can you hear me with just one year bug.

474
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:49.290
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah.

475
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.480
Suzanne Grossman: I can hear you fine. And then

476
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.180
Dawn Abriel: Allah. Allah for it later.

477
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.510
Dawn Abriel: I did. I tried

478
00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.920
Suzanne Grossman: I don't see didn't hear anything.

479
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:02.520
Okay.

480
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.220
Dawn Abriel: Um, well, we can finish up here and I'll, I'll look for it.

481
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:09.960
Suzanne Grossman: Okay.

482
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:23.220
Dawn Abriel: I also after we're done. I want you to go back to the virtual clinic, the place you came to when we first before you came in to see me, you

483
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.110
Dawn Abriel: Always go to the virtual clinic.

484
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:37.980
Dawn Abriel: Before individual appointment or any group, you have to check in with them, just like you check into the doctor's office and you go to the front office and someone checks your insurance and etc.

485
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.880
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, I was trying to call the number this morning.

486
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:49.200
Suzanne Grossman: And I'm like, what am I doing, and then I got on the tablet. And I thought I was supposed to punch that number in

487
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.700
Dawn Abriel: The zoom

488
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:59.340
Dawn Abriel: It's a video or. Right. Right. Yeah, but the numbers look so much like a like a phone. Yeah, it's confusing.

489
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.020
Suzanne Grossman: Started

490
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:06.210
Dawn Abriel: So when you go back, I want you to ask them two things. How do I do the BAM.

491
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.130
Suzanne Grossman: Bam.

492
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.790
Dawn Abriel: Be a brief addiction monitor

493
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:12.660
Okay.

494
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:14.730
Dawn Abriel: Because

495
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:26.940
Dawn Abriel: You'll have to do that before Wednesday, you can get an hour before a day before, it doesn't matter. Just don't wait to the last minute, because then you'll be late to group and

496
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.290
Suzanne Grossman: So neither for

497
00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.180
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, why not.

498
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:40.800
Dawn Abriel: And then the care coordinator will give you the group room number for that group, it changes every week.

499
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:47.550
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so that's how we we check in with people is because they have to get that unique group room number

500
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.330
Suzanne Grossman: Got it.

501
00:44:49.380 --> 00:45:01.170
Dawn Abriel: And then I want you to ask them to set you up to do a brief analysis. It's only 10 questions. It's called the AC E, the adverse childhood experiences.

502
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.050
Dawn Abriel: I guessing you did one for kaseman but

503
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.060
Dawn Abriel: Just one time.

504
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:15.960
Dawn Abriel: And let's decide on your dose. I'm guessing that we're going to have to fiddle, a little bit.

505
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.650
Dawn Abriel: So you took a dose at eight this morning.

506
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:35.400
Dawn Abriel: Yes, you need at least 12 hours until you have to be in withdrawal before you can take the buprenorphine otherwise it'll kick you into really severe

507
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.200
Dawn Abriel: Withdraw yeah

508
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:38.820
Suzanne Grossman: The

509
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:50.700
Dawn Abriel: buprenorphine has a higher affinity for the receptor. So it'll knock all your oxy off and preferentially bind to the receptors.

510
00:45:51.180 --> 00:46:07.140
Suzanne Grossman: This was the part that scared me cuz I didn't know that. Dr. Krista St. Vincent didn't say a word. Unless up to 30 this morning when I was Googling and got a live person that's when I heard about you have to be in withdrawal.

511
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.560
Suzanne Grossman: So yeah well hours of withdrawal. Yeah.

512
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:23.940
Dawn Abriel: At least, because if you're you'll know you'll know right away. And if that happens, just know that it will pass the buprenorphine will come into effect.

513
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:33.960
Dawn Abriel: Eventually, but given the dose that you're on. I'm guessing you're going to need at least two strips.

514
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:50.700
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to write for two but I recommend that you take one and you see how you do. You know, you're getting too much buprenorphine. If you get sleepy, it should not make you sleepy. If you're good.

515
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.320
Dawn Abriel: If the if all the medicine is binding to the receptors.

516
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.520
Okay.

517
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:07.920
Dawn Abriel: So what I want you to do is around eight o'clock tonight. You're going to take a sub if it takes about an hour to kick in and you know if you're

518
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:21.390
Dawn Abriel: If you're, if you're really disturbed you wake up at three o'clock in the morning, then we know that that's not enough for you and the in the morning you'll take two of them.

519
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:30.690
Dawn Abriel: All at the same time. This is a long acting medicine. You do not have to split it up during the day, you take both of the strips in the morning.

520
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.190
Suzanne Grossman: Okay.

521
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:46.800
Dawn Abriel: So then that'll be it takes two or three days before we know what your blood level is steady at. So you've got to keep really track of how your body's feeling

522
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:59.760
Dawn Abriel: Throughout the experience. So this is a drug that you won't need to go up and up and up and up on you'll get to a dose that will hold you and

523
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:08.880
Dawn Abriel: Eventually in a month or so we will start very slowly, very tiny bit bringing you down.

524
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.710
Suzanne Grossman: OK. OK.

525
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:22.650
Dawn Abriel: So yeah, I'll write for two and on the bottle. It'll just say to a day but start out, taking the one tonight when you can

526
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.520
Suzanne Grossman: Got it because I'm going to actually have to take

527
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:39.840
Suzanne Grossman: In all honesty, I'm gonna have to take a medicine soon so that I can get over the sickness, to get to Edgewood which is you know 22 miles away to get to the pharmacy.

528
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.990
Suzanne Grossman: So now I gotta start counting from the time I take it.

529
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:53.250
Suzanne Grossman: Or am I getting the prescription today. Yeah. Oh, thank God. Thank you so much. I'm so ready.

530
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.530
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, so I'm looking at

531
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.030
Suzanne Grossman: Like if we hang up at noon I can't start this until midnight.

532
00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:04.440
Dawn Abriel: Right.

533
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.120
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, got it.

534
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.960
Suzanne Grossman: I 100% understand

535
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.690
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so when is your group.

536
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.890
Suzanne Grossman: My group is Wednesday at 130

537
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:30.570
Dawn Abriel: Correct. And I will put your name in one of the care coordinators named Jamie bird bone will set up an appointment for you to see Dr. Jackson and

538
00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.110
Dawn Abriel: You will, you will tell her that you want to be in that Wednesday.

539
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:43.740
Dawn Abriel: 130 group. I think there are enough. She's been waiting for me to find enough people for her to start so you'll be able to get right in on the beginning of this

540
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.760
Dawn Abriel: She does like a 12 week course.

541
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.230
Dawn Abriel: And it starts over

542
00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.540
Suzanne Grossman: So all right, and

543
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.510
Dawn Abriel: You might Google her and listen to her TED talk.

544
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.420
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, he's last name.

545
00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:01.290
Dawn Abriel: J CK s o n

546
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.520
Dawn Abriel: Tracy is her first name.

547
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.170
Suzanne Grossman: Oh, okay. I was looking at Jamie urban

548
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.870
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's the care coordinator that'll help

549
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.040
Suzanne Grossman: You. I got confused right there. All right. Yeah. Bear with me.

550
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.130
Suzanne Grossman: No problem. Okay, I will Google. I'm getting really good at Google.

551
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.590
Dawn Abriel: So do you have any questions.

552
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.690
Suzanne Grossman: I don't believe so.

553
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:40.950
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I'm just gonna check. Let me, let me try to do put the prescription in right now, so I make sure they have the right pharmacy.

554
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.760
Suzanne Grossman: That was what I was going to ask is, if you could give it to

555
00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:51.090
Suzanne Grossman: My Walker road, I believe I'm gonna check my bottle. One of the many

556
00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:04.620
Dawn Abriel: So, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 246 I'm only going to give you enough to get to group. That way we can reevaluate.

557
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:05.700
Okay.

558
00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:09.480
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah.

559
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.400
Dawn Abriel: Five Walker road is what I have

560
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.120
Yet

561
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.320
Suzanne Grossman: And

562
00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.140
Suzanne Grossman: Was it yesterday.

563
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:36.120
Suzanne Grossman: Someone already sent me up. Oh, it was yesterday when she called to teach me the video I already asked her to send my lab request to try corn in Edgewood so

564
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:37.890
Dawn Abriel: Oh, perfect, perfect.

565
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.290
Suzanne Grossman: And I just got a message says my doctor has sent

566
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.860
Suzanne Grossman: Your doctor has sent you a discount for your prescription

567
00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.730
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, that's me. That just means that I wrote the order

568
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.620
Dawn Abriel: Some pharmacies. Let me do that automatically, which is kind of nice.

569
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.210
Suzanne Grossman: Okay.

570
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.730
Dawn Abriel: It doesn't mean that it made it to the pharmacy just means that

571
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:10.470
Dawn Abriel: I wrote the order. Okay.

572
00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:11.760
Suzanne Grossman: Yeah, I got it.

573
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:13.170
tricky stuff.

574
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:31.920
Suzanne Grossman: So I do have a question, because I am scared to death withdraw my body's been through enough. I'm so treacherous little body is just getting weak you do you think that I should wait longer than 12 hours or just do it right at the 12 hour mark.

575
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.950
Suzanne Grossman: And then I should be okay.

576
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:49.230
Dawn Abriel: Look, this is what you can do if you're really scared, cut it up cut one of the strips in half and only take four milligrams, see how you do. If you get sicker. You know, you have to wait longer

577
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.220
Suzanne Grossman: OK, I will

578
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.380
Dawn Abriel: Feel a little better.

579
00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.120
Dawn Abriel: But then it only last for four hours. Well, then you know you need that full eight

580
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.410
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, and how long again or is one strips post last 24 hour period, but

581
00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:16.950
Dawn Abriel: 24 hours if you have enough if you're if the medicine binds to all the receptors that you have created because of the high dose of

582
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:17.580
Opioid

583
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.080
Suzanne Grossman: Okay.

584
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.530
Suzanne Grossman: And I'm going to start with the half strip tonight.

585
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.260
Dawn Abriel: That's what I would recommend

586
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.300
Suzanne Grossman: Okay, that's what I needed to know.

587
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.250
Suzanne Grossman: I'm sorry. I'm so tired of being tortured by medication.

588
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.130
Suzanne Grossman: Really I get. Oh.

589
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:45.390
Suzanne Grossman: And my family so scared they're like they were so against opioids and now they're scared that I'm not gonna be able to handle

590
00:53:46.380 --> 00:54:02.490
Suzanne Grossman: The Suboxone and I said I, giving it a shot. No matter what. And I'm sorry, you guys are scared, but this is the game plan with my last and latest specialist because I'm Dr padlock is my last referral.

591
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:14.580
Suzanne Grossman: The, the GIS here at press and UNAM so there's done there's nothing else they can do for me now it's nutrition nutrition nutrition and I die.

592
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:29.910
Suzanne Grossman: So I'm thinking opioid slope. They just general messing with my head. Let's try this pain block monthly which will be a little bit of hell. But I think that the Suboxone is a big step. And I think you

593
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:31.350
Suzanne Grossman: You're trying to

594
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:41.250
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, I think most people like the simplicity. They like the

595
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:58.620
Dawn Abriel: The, the fact that they're not drowsy from the the short acting. They don't have to take it as often. It's just a little nicer medicine. It was created to address end of life pain that's what it was made for

596
