00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

2
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

3
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.150
Hi.

4
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.800
Brittney: Make the video like full size, you know,

5
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think I phones. One side is happy horizontal and other side is unhappy. I don't know which size it is

6
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.970
Brittney: A. That's a good trick.

7
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Alright, so let me open up a note and we can just dive right in here and see

8
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to kind of take a peek at where we left off. But if you have something kind of big going on. You can tell me, and we can start there.

9
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.490
Brittney: There's always something

10
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, um, but, but even though you you know you say that sometimes

11
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Current triggers have a real for me out here. It's easier for me to see because I'm not in it emotionally like you are

12
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see. Oh, that sounds a lot like back here. Let's go to this old place. It might be connected a bridge to this old storyline. So, and it also might

13
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a little bit off your chest.

14
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to

15
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.150
Brittney: My sister's during really bad. I'm extremely worried about her scared. I'm going oh

16
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:11.460
Brittney: My gosh, are yesterday ever face. It's just completely scabs and her hair was like all freaked out. Like, it just doesn't work that my sister all

17
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.690
Brittney: So she's doing man.

18
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.200
Brittney: She's like,

19
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:30.270
Brittney: I don't know. Now she kicks on her cell with opiates, so that makes me think she's still there and opiates. Yeah, it's very odd. She has an autoimmune disease and opiates just screw with her. She has Crohn's disease. So when she's doing them. She just she started

20
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

21
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:47.370
Brittney: But she might be doing other stuff she's on methadone, like a five milligrams and still doing other drugs said she was on Molly or cocaine or whatever. And she's really on

22
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.260
To death.

23
00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:00.180
Brittney: And my mom is too. And so my mom slipped up and she started partying last week and I came home and they were both here fucked up and I lost it on them.

24
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.540
Brittney: Both of them.

25
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:15.330
Brittney: And then me and Adrian. I've been fighting. It's just but silver lining. I found out, They're wrong about my copay it actually went down so we can see each other once a week.

26
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so excited.

27
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what

28
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.800
It just really

29
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.840
Brittney: Ya.

30
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Know and and on top of that. I mean, it's hard to not talk about that I had made a mistake. I'm an old school agenda user

31
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I said, Yes, on a text and it was two weeks out and I really work on this like one week maybe two week I, my eyes are like right here on this one week. It's all right here.

32
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you guys your lives are going up and down and and I'm so sorry I booked someone else. I'm so sorry. That's all my fault.

33
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.610
Brittney: It's okay.

34
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I was so

35
00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.130
Brittney: Small that day.

36
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but I thought, I thought, you know what she could, she could write me off. She could say this is just another person that doesn't put me first. I was so worried you would do that.

37
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.920
Brittney: I think I understood

38
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:25.590
Brittney: That's why I just told you if I needed to take a step back from because I was getting I was getting a little high for you because there's just so much else going on. Yeah, okay.

39
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we got the we got the good news. We can process of that other stuff and see connections without a little later. But the big precedent part is

40
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you've told me your, your sister has really tried to self destruct before and you see her doing it now and and you're scared and now your mom's even less help. I mean, if that were possible.

41
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

42
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.210
Brittney: I'm just gonna die.

43
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.950
Yeah.

44
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, but there's, I just, I haven't seen well okay let's just, we can do a quick scan. Does she hear anyone grandparent cousin auntie. Can she ever hear the wisdom of anybody to shake her out of this or does she have to just get

45
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.900
Wrong.

46
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.710
Brittney: I don't know what it's

47
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.380
Okay.

48
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the past. She's, she's attempted suicide, I believe, right.

49
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.860
Brittney: Yeah yeah

50
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.230
Brittney: And then a couple other like flute. She's the hospital is twice.

51
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your mom doesn't have any ability to help there. She just joined her and that that escape.

52
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.160
Brittney: Yeah, the last week. I mean, she got real guilty on herself. After I blew up on her and

53
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.260
Brittney: She's saying she's gonna stay home and deal with her stuff but

54
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.620
Brittney: I see that she wants to change.

55
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.660
Brittney: Whatever.

56
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.850
Brittney: All the stress. Yeah.

57
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom says she was stay home or your sister.

58
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.990
Brittney: My mom. She's, she's trying to cheer GUYS THAT SHE SCREWED UP.

59
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.910
Brittney: But, you know,

60
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.530
Brittney: Back and forth.

61
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, admit that may not last very long. Unfortunately,

62
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

63
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.900
Brittney: So,

64
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: continues in a kind of kind of predictable way right the up and down a

65
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.670
Lot of down

66
00:06:47.670 --> 00:07:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so the upside is to get to keep seeing each other. That's cool, it's affordable. I know Dr. Aubrey all she must have seen that on the record. There's a calendar that you're going to see me and she I jumped the gun. I thought she would want to know about medication.

67
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think she's going to want to know if your plan is to go to a provider outside of Braveheart which is fine. Some people only see me for the psychotherapy, they found it too pricey, and they have to go elsewhere and

68
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.680
Brittney: Do you have a plan, you know,

69
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:34.980
Brittney: I was planning on suing for at least one more time for now because I haven't looked into finding another provider and now I found my hope is with you or lower house.

70
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want me to invite her right at the tail end. I have a bio psychosocial right after our appointment, but to me to see if she can jump in and you can at least get maybe a month of medication. So you should be willing to do that for you to differentiate for a month.

71
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.420
Brittney: Or know what I have to get to see her today.

72
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, she doesn't, it's kind of, I don't know, I'll be honest with you, um,

73
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have to understand she's your physician to write an order, she needed to kind of coordinate with you.

74
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.130
Brittney: Give it some thought. I wrote

75
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.910
Brittney: I wrote her an email like three days ago I

76
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.830
Brittney: don't check to see, she replied.

77
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.380
Brittney: There you go.

78
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:29.820
Brittney: I have like two strips less though. Yeah, I was planning on trying to get in on the Monday session if I have to. But I need to see if I have enough room on my credit card.

79
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Um,

80
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I mean, I know.

81
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's let's do that medication piece right at the end, I'll just send her a little message, say, hey,

82
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a possibility. You might be able to join us. How about that.

83
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly. Let's just see. Okay.

84
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: May be possible to join at tail end of session, question mark.

85
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what she says she might have another appointment to be out of town. I don't know what's going on. Okay, let's see.

86
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me check a couple other domains.

87
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Work clipping along kind of using the skills you've developed to sort of sort of try to get that distance to check out sort of that reality check skill of yes I

88
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this perceived threat. This might be about me. But then you kind of take time to breathe and really put time in there to see if that initial assumption was spot on.

89
00:09:52.770 --> 00:10:00.840
Brittney: Works in order for new students was found myself shutting down and not being able to like focus on my work.

90
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And because of that, what's going on at home with your sister.

91
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.550
Brittney: Yeah, and we're hiring at work and they have me in Burma, go on to the interviews.

92
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:30.570
Brittney: And we interviewed with this one guy has a life and I have to share an office with this person. So I really like this guy and a lot of tech background is yoga instructor like he's done all kinds of cool stuff. And then we have another interview with my Mormon bosses nephew.

93
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.130
Brittney: Acquire instructor who's

94
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.750
Brittney: He wants to go to school to be like a

95
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:51.000
Brittney: Pa or something like medical and I was just like, so what did you want to switch like actually is the one that I'm like, So why are we hired this guy because apparently is on the they're hiring so

96
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you're going to carry an office with him instead

97
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah Oh fun

98
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.250
Brittney: To have

99
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.290
Brittney: Like a wholesome

100
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, if it was material for a stand up comedy, you're, you're creating some good material there.

101
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:17.640
Brittney: Okay.

102
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk. Let's just talk about

103
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:24.450
Brittney: Your

104
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Story. I'll tell a story.

105
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.980
Brittney: I mean, I'm not trying to sound so does my boy, it's gonna be hard to really

106
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.220
Brittney: Well, you know,

107
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.010
Brittney: He wants to be the grid that's frustrating.

108
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you never know sometimes people. I mean, there's lots of different ways that if we can postpone our initial judgment. We get to be sort of surprised. Sometimes that there is some overlap.

109
00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We all get scared. We all want love. We all want security we look for it in different places. He's looking for it and maybe you know structured religion.

110
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We're looking for it in psychology, philosophy, you know, and sort of right meditation. We're all looking for it, we can find some common, common ground there. If you have to really stretch

111
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.460
Brittney: Yeah yeah

112
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll be funny, you'll be able to kind of giggle with your friends about it, like, Wow, this is what I really wanted to say this is what I said, This is what I was thinking. This is what I said.

113
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.430
Yeah. All right.

114
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, it's but I don't want to miss the part about it's been hard to focus has that actually impacted productivity is it catching your bosses attention is that adding to stress or is it really is just a self perceived

115
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.880
Brittney: Peace. No, I would say.

116
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.430
Brittney: I was I was upset yesterday on my phone that I should

117
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:11.790
Brittney: Remember we've we've always for two days. I'm sure you've noticed you haven't said anything to me about it. I was planning on picking it up. This next week. But I literally just, I just couldn't I just literally I didn't want to be there. I wanted to leave so

118
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.530
Brittney: Several times last week, where did you want to go.

119
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.380
Brittney: Far enough to think and be present.

120
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.500
Brittney: I haven't gone to the gym as last week.

121
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.240
Brittney: Okay.

122
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

123
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:32.550
You don't want to

124
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present. That's a really profound thing, right. I don't want to be sort of present with what's going on. I don't want to be thinking about it and I want to be feeling it, that, that's it.

125
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.860
Yeah.

126
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

127
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sounds like it.

128
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:50.760
Okay.

129
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.650
All right.

130
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do let's do some therapeutic

131
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Intervention here let's let's kind of get into to shifting what you're experiencing right now you got real close to almost reliving some of that.

132
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That emotion.

133
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's together kind of bring our attention.

134
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Back inward and let's actually do some remembering pulling those protective qualities pulling nurturing and pulling the wise figure

135
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll remind you a little bit about him. She's nice breathing.

136
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just find your natural breath and got really nice posture. They're really let that Aaron, let it make its way all the way to the bottom of the long

137
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.410
You really get that down there in the bottom.

138
00:14:48.510 --> 00:15:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And so doing just slowly and gently as a part of this acknowledgement that you have right now and you can choose right now to turn your mind to a different focus and we can turn it to

139
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This sensing quality of the mountains.

140
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Bringing peaceful light and carefree

141
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And

142
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: All the sudden notice a temperature change if you were in the mountains. How might it, feel it, touch the skin. Maybe your lips and your cheeks.

143
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you notice

144
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A sound or the lack of noise.

145
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It might feel peaceful

146
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be unburdened and protected there.

147
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You might then bring your attention to this.

148
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This routine maybe of turning attention to protective quality yes and nurturing that Mother Earth.

149
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Always, in a sense, wanting you to grow and develop

150
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Into this whole person that you are

151
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This authentic self.

152
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing

153
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this awareness of a wise quality coming on when the sun is felt on your face.

154
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of tethering between that imagery, which is in the mind.

155
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And seeing if the body's willing to accept that as a truth that you can feel protective qualities nurturing and wisdom.

156
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: In that imagery. Make sure the body's in congruence with it.

157
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of moving back and forth.

158
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Scanning maybe the chest or

159
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders.

160
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe the hips or

161
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.080
The guy.

162
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just checking in.

163
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this whole person that is you. Is it on same page is there congruency just paying attention.

164
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: See where your mind drifts off.

165
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to how you gently bring yourself back because that's the process, the mind wants to wander and solve and project into the future.

166
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But you come back to the body.

167
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right here sit on your bed, talking to someone that cares about you.

168
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

169
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the only moment you have

170
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If this one.

171
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to how you feel in your body.

172
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being a witness

173
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Gently coming back.

174
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving between the imagery

175
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You share a little bit about what your, your thoughts.

176
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming up for you right now.

177
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.940
Brittney: On in my body, but

178
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:43.590
Brittney: So,

179
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing you do.

180
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Brittany Is you hold back, hold back and hold back.

181
00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have enough privacy right now. Maybe it was only 420 seconds that you didn't hold back. This would be different, where you grow tissue and a pillow and literally didn't hold back.

182
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You always hope that when you didn't. And you're right here. It's not going to last forever. But she really solved and cried and screamed into that pillow, together with me.

183
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we try it.

184
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you always hold back.

185
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to take a hold of you away forever.

186
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason you don't want to feel it is only because you think it's going to take over. It's not going to, you can you can move in and then you'll open your eyes. And you'll see me here you'll see you're not going through this alone, you're not in a row by yourself. I'm right here.

187
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get to I get to contain that sorrow with you.

188
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You always hold back.

189
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you love and cry and and and and if you can shout it out. But you need to tell me if there's so many other room and you can give it words out loud.

190
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: See if letting it out works better than holding back

191
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:35.580
Brittney: Okay.

192
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.260
Fair enough.

193
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: At least you can say what that thought was right before you said, I don't think I can. What was the reason you. Thank you. You're not giving yourself permission to do it.

194
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.340
Brittney: I feel confused about.

195
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.490
Brittney: My emotions and

196
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.260
Brittney: Reactions lately. Okay.

197
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:01.890
Brittney: You want to

198
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.950
Brittney: Tell me about your

199
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.090
Brittney: Medications like

200
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.360
Brittney: Times I feel

201
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.610
Brittney: Like it's not allowing me to fill

202
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.050
Brittney: I mean I'm bouncing back but

203
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.570
Brittney: I guess I don't feel emotionally

204
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.000
Brittney: Mature for as long as, like,

205
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.070
Brittney: I also been feeling the UPS as much

206
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Not crying as much which you do like but also not feeling the joy.

207
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.600
Brittney: Yeah.

208
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.060
Brittney: Yeah okay, what's going on with

209
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This statement here is is pretty common that's in common. When you're sharing here feeling off.

210
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Way better be nice to to find out what it's like to be like

211
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Not so so off might be nice to learn that I haven't heard much

212
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.080
Brittney: Much of those moments I felt it was just, I just feel like this. I felt like I was really good.

213
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:30.630
Brittney: More or less positive and positive trajectory and then like I don't know if it's just holding stress or

214
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.790
Brittney: For mobile stuff.

215
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:38.670
Okay.

216
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

217
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how what you did was you said I have, I have to understand it before I I give myself permission to emote. You don't have to know

218
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: why I'm here.

219
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to do that.

220
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:02.070
Brittney: I think practicing that so much because I don't like being amongst other people

221
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've been doing

222
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But since I met you, this is a this is I wanted to do something different with you and I have given it thought it's the holding back

223
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I do you really is is is the so notice it wasn't know when it's not that I'll collapse that all beat fall into an abyss of despair. Now it's I'm confused. I need to know first why I'm upset. You're not letting me help. You're not letting me do that.

224
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it's having a witness. What if it's getting it all out hearing yourself. Say it. The confusion and let that catharsis happen.

225
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you already have been doing the I'm holding it back, but it's getting to the point where you can't focus at work and you want to get away and you want to sleep. You don't want to feel

226
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just try it. Grab grab your pillow kind of put it at your chest.

227
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it comes up, it comes up. Okay, so let's go back a little bit.

228
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to

229
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid, something will happen to my sister. That's a big one right

230
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:25.890
Yeah.

231
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that thought going through your head just now.

232
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:46.890
Brittney: Second,

233
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it because you start to project in a future.

234
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.420
Okay.

235
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember

236
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:08.880
Brittney: After

237
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.480
Brittney: We do our, you know,

238
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay.

239
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:15.180
We're

240
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.970
Brittney: being brutally honest with her. This week, but what else to do.

241
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.210
Brittney: I mean, I'm not trying to be mean like

242
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.890
Brittney: People do yesterday she looks worried about it.

243
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not mean

244
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's tough love. Okay, that's what love is, she needs it shoot your sisters not around your she is in deep addiction. She

245
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I

246
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Wish I wish she was on pretrial release and a judge can pull her in and get her into custody and force residential treatment.

247
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish we had those arms to reach in and get her.

248
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:21.780
Brittney: She's gonna have to have her other resources. My mom called her method or older, she was still you still are still provide

249
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.600
Brittney: Just want to make money with every other stupid says

250
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's right, yeah.

251
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.530
That's right, for profit.

252
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's disgusting.

253
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.530
I know

254
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any doubt that you called her out on her addictive behavior because you don't love her. It mean it's not that it's you called her out because you love her. That's the truth.

255
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's not if I said something mean no

256
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not the cause of what she's doing what

257
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.030
Brittney: Goes to her, she's

258
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.250
Brittney: built on top of all the

259
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:25.440
Brittney: OK.

260
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.890
OK, I see it.

261
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how old is this guilt is that even older than what you would happen with

262
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.560
Brittney: For

263
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.000
Brittney: Always

264
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.220
Brittney: Be the harsh word fear, you know, basically.

265
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.220
Brittney: You know,

266
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:12.840
Brittney: No, no.

267
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.600
Brittney: I always wish we could be closer and I felt like we're getting close before

268
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.660
Brittney: We build our direction so

269
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.440
Brittney: But she's always kind of resented me for

270
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.380
Brittney: A brutally honest with her.

271
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.130
Brittney: She doesn't let anybody and she doesn't hear anything, even before she was really

272
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.520
Brittney: She must really

273
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.220
Brittney: Have some stuff that she can't, we can't tell her anything

274
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: She's, she's your mother's daughter.

275
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.300
Brittney: meaner version.

276
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.440
Brittney: Though

277
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: She's, she's doing the best she can

278
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.980
She is

279
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.610
Brittney: Just realized it's just like

280
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:41.100
Brittney: Hate to put it all to one event that seems like everything really when my dad died, you know, that's just

281
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.990
Brittney: I didn't know how to deal with it. I can help Paleo if it

282
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.150
Brittney: Comes through dealt with it. That's what she tried to kill herself.

283
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.450
Brittney: And I think that's what my mom stopped really

284
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.050
Brittney: Maybe meeting.

285
00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you stepped in. As Karen.

286
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.190
Brittney: Try, try made my mom wasn't

287
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.930
Brittney: She got a lie, like the year 16 or 17

288
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.650
Brittney: You know, wake it up for success and were

289
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.510
Brittney: Several times to be really of school. You know, so

290
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.950
Brittney: Rapper that she was played for years. Good.

291
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.870
Drinking

292
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.720
Brittney: You know,

293
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we work with that one. Let's do a really isolated piece with, I don't know if you have your, your little items, your things

294
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To have

295
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Things next to your phone tall.

296
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.310
Brittney: Let's go.

297
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: shoulder width apart.

298
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:50.850
I'm thinking

299
00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this guilt because this isn't the first time I've heard it, and I'm not, I'm not suggesting that we're getting to the core because I don't think we are. But this is an important one that does show up quite a bit.

300
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.550
Brittney: Are you see

301
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This one right here.

302
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you go to it dad passed away. I watched my mom, go do her this then I watched Haley. And then I tried to be responsible. I picked up where there was no parent taking care of shit, it just right you stepped up.

303
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you don't have to tell me what it is but pull up maybe that first awareness that it's all on me something in there, right, that one.

304
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. That's okay.

305
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you became the one

306
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sure, is it foods cooked that people get themselves to school that, what do you, what do you think that first responsibility started to come into play.

307
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.670
Brittney: Probably

308
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.820
Brittney: The school

309
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, getting getting to school, keeping house clean

310
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.000
Brittney: Yeah, we do that I was doing a lot of the grocery shopping

311
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just start from there and we might do this a little, a little differently. We're normally I might say,

312
00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do the eye movement, you might actually talk through it as things come up

313
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And not wait till the end of the iteration might make do it a little differently. Let's just see what happens with that because I want to see if I can catch something else that might be going on in there.

314
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want you to do right pull up that maybe it was grocery shopping or maybe the awareness that mom's unavailable. And then I have to step up right in there.

315
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it might even be

316
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotion of

317
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sad or I couldn't get it just right and Haley wasn't making it to school and and the cooking wasn't just right or something, as if to say, I, I didn't do it right.

318
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a tricky little moment. It's like I'm going to take on this developmentally inappropriate role and I'm failing at it, you see it.

319
00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.440
Brittney: Yeah, just think about

320
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.910
Brittney: Like smoking weed with my sister.

321
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's a good one, you probably feel like, well, it's similar to I introduced her to pills.

322
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's. Why don't we use that one. Okay, because we won't. We won't expand out too far because I know there's a whole bunch of sort of branches. But let's do that one because that one. Got you. Did you just feel sad just now.

323
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or was it something else. Sad. Okay, so we got sad. Let's real quick. Let me just check how distressed your let me hear sort of zero to 100 what number you have to think

324
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.690
Brittney: 40. Okay. Okay. Got it.

325
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So that one. I think we can work with that you're still using using your whole brain, it's still online the frontal cortex online.

326
00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was a how how was Haley at the time.

327
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: 14 or

328
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.250
Brittney: I can you remember when she started

329
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.000
Okay.

330
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are maybe about 16 we're thinking

331
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.350
Okay, got it.

332
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe, picture, picture that that piece for a moment and now

333
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can grab what your belief about yourself at that time was. That's it. These are hard to get to in a way I can help you get there.

334
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of free process.

335
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.920
Brittney: My belief about myself.

336
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.150
Yeah.

337
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.430
Brittney: I don't think I did a lot of introspection, I thought that I was

338
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.690
Brittney: Doing pretty good. I mean, besides always just been super hard on myself.

339
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.790
Brittney: To do good.

340
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.410
Brittney: I

341
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.520
Brittney: Think that I think my dad's death really affected me so much. I didn't think that

342
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.130
Brittney: I wasn't aware

343
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, but you did say a lot. I'm not affected by my dad's death.

344
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.380
Brittney: I'm doing

345
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.250
Pretty good.

346
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet

347
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And at that time.

348
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You were stepping up and you were smoking to get through this.

349
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are a couple of pieces right

350
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

351
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:47.130
Brittney: Oh,

352
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.040
Brittney: I thought that

353
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.690
Brittney: Was

354
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.210
Brittney: What I was doing it wasn't like I'm so mad because

355
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.440
Brittney: Whoa, it was

356
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.760
Was

357
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing pretty good. My dad passed away. I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing pretty good doing pretty good right Jim pretty good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Where you going to school.

358
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing the grocery shopping, keeping the house clean. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

359
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that closer

360
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.500
Yeah.

361
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.840
Right now.

362
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You are years later. Now, you know,

363
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to have been believing about yourself. At that time, I know this is hard to get, get to

364
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The ideal will go ridiculously ideal and work our way backwards.

365
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.990
Brittney: Or

366
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I am I found that father has passed away, would there be

367
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm without a father would there be that

368
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.000
Brittney: You okay

369
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: My dad was not good.

370
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.240
Brittney: What beliefs.

371
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. What beliefs, do you have about yourself around that.

372
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:41.820
Brittney: One have a father to walk me down it goes back to not feeling good of my relationship with it.

373
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough because you won't have him there at those sort of pivotal life events.

374
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And had an air.

375
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And. Did I hear you correctly, that I'm angry at him too.

376
00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

377
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:09.690
Okay.

378
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Go, go to something ridiculous. You can even laugh at it and you can make fun of me.

379
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What would the thought be if it was

380
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That as this little person, this, this young girl.

381
00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: was aware that her father had passed away.

382
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And was okay with herself. What might she believed in herself at that time. This ideal positive belief would have been the ideal.

383
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.790
Brittney: Strong resilient.

384
00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepted yeah strong resilient accepted. Is that right,

385
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.610
Brittney: Though like I'm affected like

386
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.240
Brittney: But the ideal.

387
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's funny, I was like, I don't think I can write that far down

388
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.760
Brittney: I

389
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.430
Brittney: If the ago or something. I would leave or something. I would want to believe that

390
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: At least let's at least do what I think I'm

391
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This ideal this like all at least say it whenever you're but come on. This is unrealistic. Let me hear that one.

392
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:52.440
Brittney: That me and my mom and sister were to come out stronger and more

393
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.330
Brittney: You know,

394
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.390
Brittney: Socially acceptable or

395
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:10.440
Brittney: The ideal would be to have my family like stronger than. Yep.

396
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So have come together to have

397
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: greater and stronger, more cohesively over this loss.

398
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

399
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:22.530
Brittney: Yeah.

400
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:24.810
Brittney: I am

401
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.380
Brittney: Deeply you

402
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Lost my father we connected we are coming together as a family.

403
00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just touching base a little bit again with those those figures oftentimes it's nice to

404
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To have actual people want to get away from this imagery that you already have, which I think beautiful just want to check in again.

405
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your, your will, your relationship with your dad. Get him body, a bit of the protective nature than nurturing or the wise.

406
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.410
The wise.

407
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about

408
00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.490
Brittney: Who has always looked up to him, super, super smart.

409
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.140
Brittney: Engineer.

410
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You would hear him like at the dinner table or in conversations with people. You're like, Oh, wow.

411
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.750
Brittney: College graduate, you know, like a

412
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.300
Brittney: Successful

413
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:01.140
Brittney: I don't know, to clarify with my mom when he passed away.

414
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:03.180
Brittney: For years,

415
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.200
Brittney: Stop, stop, or

416
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: They're together or not it the relationship between your, your dad doesn't change, right, that that static

417
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.490
Brittney: Relationship changed a lot because they were together.

418
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.650
Brittney: Like, like you're putting all your first

419
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:39.510
Brittney: stopped coming to our games and stuff because it was a drive across town. He was coaching their soccer games just

420
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:46.560
Brittney: Not taking us on family vacations. He took my two half brothers.

421
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:56.340
Brittney: To the family reunion in North Dakota me in a we were invited you know like a lot of artists on a painting that's right

422
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:57.810
Brittney: Which is

423
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:05.550
Brittney: Because I thought, but later if i would i would really be able to click because of school.

424
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.510
Brittney: I mean, he tried to be loving affection, when we saw him.

425
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.670
Brittney: But at one point he told us.

426
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:22.050
Brittney: Because my mom and stuff over doing a lot of siding.

427
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:38.520
Brittney: And stuff barbers kind of been really mean to my sister. A lot of times we think it's because she has money that's biological kid he adopted as a baby. I think she took it on are failing to say much. Just like my mom. Yeah.

428
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:48.180
Brittney: I mean, when it let her get up for that from the dinner table because she didn't eat her food, since it's been there three hours she should be spending other dads bigger table by herself, you know,

429
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so much poor parents out there, isn't there.

430
00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:01.950
Brittney: That's a shame. And so many people should do some really smart people who are the ones

431
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.500
Brittney: Yes, it's kind of, it's kind of us that

432
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I happen to agree. I think people are gonna have a little you know license of a child.

433
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:21.060
Brittney: I used to have to pass the fuckin test. I mean, you have to pass a test drive a car. But here, here's the human life.

434
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

435
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm with you. I'm, I mean, it'd be a hard thing to construct and get approved, but

436
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.550
Brittney: I'm out of your title.

437
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

438
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

439
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really complicated and I hope you can see that part of, of what I want to do is really keep this reprocessing very isolated because it doesn't take long for it to right

440
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.910
Brittney: Oh yeah, I just tears. You know, it's

441
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, it's okay, it's my job to kind of keep us keep us corral together, that's just fine.

442
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.020
Brittney: So,

443
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's get back in here for a second. I just wanted to see if there was an actual, real or imagined actual person or maybe an image animal or something that we could do.

444
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:12.510
Brittney: A

445
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit in the father, but it doesn't take long before

446
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.270
Brittney: It goes to

447
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost a negative so

448
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.060
Brittney: I don't feel like I could put any people in those categories.

449
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:30.720
Brittney: I did, I did idolize them for being smart work.

450
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's a difference between

451
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: A wise person.

452
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.810
Brittney: We can have knowledge that we

453
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.820
Brittney: Store and

454
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: With him about how to use it and apply it. Right, that's that kind of wisdom and he didn't. He didn't use

455
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.110
Brittney: Wisdom of

456
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Being a parent.

457
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess I get a little worried about using that one, but I did try

458
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check on something though, for some people it's this. So let me just dip in here for a moment.

459
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.650
Brittney: And you

460
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna have to watch

461
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, do it too too much. I don't think just just keep in check any kind of people pleasing for just a moment, but it in check.

462
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.010
Brittney: Check in here.

463
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: With me and see

464
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What you

465
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.780
Clean and

466
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Grow and develop into your potential, do I want that for you.

467
00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:34.230
Brittney: Yes.

468
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm excited. No ambivalence.

469
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just ominous. See, see if if when Scott a potential here for a nurturing figure. Let me get over to protective you haven't got to that over here with me.

470
00:47:52.530 --> 00:48:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you born and grew up, you don't get to see me protecting you much from David conversation from the dog or another client, you don't get to feel it too too much.

471
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I take that role on a lot because I see it as my role to not have anybody tell someone how to live their life or dominating the conversation in a sort of narcissistic way if it doesn't contribute or maybe maybe the doctor might do something. And so you don't get to see me.

472
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Making sure

473
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm taking care of everybody.

474
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. But I want you to see.

475
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That I just described. Something I just described emotional protection, where I i might catch someone violating your boundary emotional

476
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I couldn't do to physical because I'm not really right there. But that would be someone who would talk and maybe be putting their hand on you while they're talking and say that's way too familiar. I might go in and I might sort of stand in the middle.

477
00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of create a little bit of space between the two. Or I might teach you how to stand with your arms.

478
00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of put out here with someone who is doing that because you can talk like this. And that puts a whole arm length away from someone who doesn't have good boundaries to be like, Oh my gosh, I was there this weekend. It was a great time.

479
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And this way, they never get any closer to you than this. So there's that physical boundary thing or taking slowly taking a step back and working your way back

480
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just described a couple of examples of people that catch where you might have someone crossing a boundary physically or emotionally in your memory D. Can you picture someone that was able to do that.

481
00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:56.700
Okay.

482
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I want to do that for you. You're not going to get to see me too many times doing it because you're not in group very often but

483
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:08.460
Brittney: You do.

484
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: A little a little here and there.

485
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a witness of that, then that's good. So, and I'm not, you know, I'm not on the smart level. I have some storage is some information about neuroscience, maybe here and there.

486
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I won't match the the wisdom one, but I think I have a fair shot at nurturing and protective

487
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:32.310
Wise.

488
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, right. But you might you might also picture. What about in sort of that spiritual realm. I mean, the Buddha or someone else that appearing clean. There's no, like, for some people it's a it's a Jesus Christ image. They're not even Christian, but there's just something about that guy.

489
00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, it's like, Wouldn't that be great.

490
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe go in that in that space when it comes to wise just meaning they know how to use their knowledge and their experience.

491
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In a useful way. What do you think of

492
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.970
Brittney: I mean like the closest that comes to mind is my friend D droves. If anyone in my life can

493
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.450
Brittney: I think that they're able to do that, it would be

494
00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:44.760
Brittney: But I can't really humanize it because I feel like he runs a blog and like, yeah, I don't want

495
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Their untrustworthy, right, we're gonna let you

496
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.930
Brittney: Know, yeah.

497
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but what in this imagery and we're going to keep we'll keep we'll go in and we just dipped in again and maybe we'll do it again. Maybe we'll start

498
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: To develop a little bit

499
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you. I think we're able to tolerate disappointment with just memorize the movie process a little bit of what what happened with my double booking right

500
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I let you down. And I think early on in treatment. I said, eventually, at some point it will mean to do it all disappoint you feel

501
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that and

502
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.820
Brittney: What we do with it is going to be important.

503
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.740
And you

504
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Came back again, and you're talking to me again you're risking again even though I'm and I lot

505
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:51.780
I think it's important

506
00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: People do that with you to you get some

507
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Things get to overdo this under do that and we get to still deeply care about you because you're not this indiscretion this misstep this. Whoa, you focused on yourself there. You, you didn't pick this catch that. Did you

508
00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Get that space to when you gave that to me.

509
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To be human. I hope you realize you

510
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Create base, maybe for you to do it, you

511
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to be flawed to you get to make mistakes. You get to have not known how to do something at 16 because it wasn't your job.

512
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're learning now what to do. Listen to how few people you had as a resource.

513
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're being so hard on yourself.

514
00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Many people will say, Grandma, mother, father, like that. Right. Not a lot of people in this program.

515
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people are a lot like what, you're right, they're going, huh, yeah, pretty much everybody sucks but

516
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know those normal people, the ones that don't have this complex trauma stuff.

517
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: They're able to, they had the good enough parenting, you know, they at least 30% of the time they got it together. So what you're going through doesn't surprise me but

518
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But have some compassion for the fact that you're expecting yourself to know things that you were never taught and never modeled in a reliable, consistent way.

519
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean you caught me

520
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Of it, and that has has fed you, thank goodness.

521
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.980
Been surviving comes

522
00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To play with the idea and you can reject it right away, but for a while until we start to cultivate really sort of trusting healthy relationships.

523
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The therapeutic relationship for some people is where we start, we get to play out being angry at me being disappointed in me. How will go into your handle it well she rejects you well she criticizes you

524
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: push you away happen. It happens in here. You can work that out in here safely because I'm my I know my intentions are to I want to, I want to hold on and sometimes I've had to hold your anger and your rotation and impatience, I've

525
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Held after

526
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a lot. My arms stretched really wide, I can hold a lot

527
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: For a while, play with and see if you like it when there's invitations to explore some imagery

528
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.080
Around

529
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.020
Brittney: Protective. See if you can

530
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember how you caught that little bit in group or maybe I did someone in

531
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: She picked up on it that person.

532
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:52.800
didn't even have

533
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That was clean.

534
00:55:59.130 --> 00:55:59.460
Brittney: Want

535
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.430
Brittney: Your audio is cutting up

536
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.210
Brittney: Sorry.

537
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We're back.

538
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.360
Brittney: Yeah, sorry, would you say was like two sentences.

539
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:16.590
No.

540
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think the idea is

541
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have a combination, because I want a real human in there. And while there's a little you can experiment with me and then you can let me go. As soon as you find someone else but just play with it.

542
00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Experiencing meeting with a real human and that will be me for a little while. I don't want to create a dependency, because that's that's counterproductive for a little while when there ain't nobody else. I think we need to do it.

543
00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I trust myself. So I know you can you can rely on me for this so

544
00:56:54.030 --> 00:57:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just when we do this imagery next time just play with Glenn, I can picture this, the quality and then I'll say, okay, and then bring in

545
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: bringing this to your of maybe interacting, how would how would when as a protective person being in the mountains. Now, and with the water and the sunshine and kind of picture of what we

546
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.020
Would be doing quality, what would be going on. You see,

547
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.940
Brittney: The interaction of a person, and I guess it'll be me for a while.

548
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If it starts to morph into something else that's fine too. Okay.

549
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:32.880
Brittney: All right.

550
00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.630
Brittney: I didn't quite get to do

551
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You any of the bilateral stimulation, but

552
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about what you noticed today asked you to to dip in right to some of those feelings and

553
00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:51.840
Brittney: Your fighter.

554
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: sharpened up a little bit of the imagery

555
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.240
Important for you today.

556
00:57:59.490 --> 00:57:59.940
Brittney: I'm sorry.

557
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice it's important that happened to you.

558
00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.680
Brittney: My biggest means is just

559
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.490
Brittney: I guess I have like I close myself off a bit

560
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.840
Brittney: Of know surely like I guess to other people really

561
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:27.450
Brittney: Like it is self sabotage. Should we

562
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:32.340
Brittney: Still so like

563
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.270
Brittney: That's a bit more clear. I haven't

564
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:45.960
Brittney: Figured out how to do it for myself. It's really hard for me to let anybody else take their criticism you

565
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:47.610
Brittney: Know,

566
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're so busy criticizing yourself one more dose of it might just push you over the edge.

567
00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, I know. And in here, Brittany, you get to say that that's what's different. You get to say I already have this running dialogue of this and this and this is what's wrong with me. I don't know that I can tolerate even feedback from you right now. I can, I can hear that.

568
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling for you to say that out loud. Why then, I know. And just what we do.

569
00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Read on how intense that negative

570
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Dialogue is going on inside.

571
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:34.710
Brittney: Your

572
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Own day was interpersonal your healing.

573
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:39.150
Might be

574
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of what the same nice. Okay.

575
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Rolled with stuff we were doing you hung in there for it.

576
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You did.

577
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.310
Brittney: And I think

578
00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I think if we had had time to do this other piece. I think he would have done it. I think we're but I really want you safe. First, so I keep wanting to build the resourcing before we go.

579
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Too much into too much reprocessing I've watched. It's just so much more successful if we can really keep building the resourcing and then we interweave those so it does come from a protective place actually wanting to be ready.

580
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.050
Brittney: And prepared. Okay.

581
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's schedule another appointment.

582
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.280
Brittney: You don't normally do. Sorry.

583
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I have been doing it now for like three, three weeks.

584
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, three and then two and then no and then what but yes I have.

585
01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: As my kids get older, I been carving out some time.

586
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you want to do it again on the 29th, if I

587
01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Have any kid things going on.

588
01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:04.020
Brittney: Yeah, that works.

589
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, everybody.

590
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like this whole next week is is booked at AT THAT YOU SAID THURSDAY. I think you put your head down. It was Thursday. You wanted like I

591
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.030
Brittney: Have to be in the morning.

592
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. I have someone in there right now. But I'll tell you what, if something happens without appointment. I'll reach out to you right away. Do you want to do a like let's hold Saturday. And then if that Thursday opens up you can you get first dibs on that one.

593
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.240
Brittney: That's, yeah that's that's

594
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.910
Brittney: Great right be better to do it on Saturday force me to get out of it.

595
01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you know also affecting your sleep too because it's like, Oh my gosh, I have to get up for this woman tomorrow. I can't stay up till two in the morning, you don't. I mean, then

596
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a chain reaction of I got to take care of this stuff. Now I gotta get myself to bed. Maybe that for some people, that's that is helpful.

597
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So 830

598
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.690
Brittney: On Saturday. Okay. Sounds good.

599
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. And a little bit with the imagery pulling me into it and see how it feels. And I want to hear about it. Oh, it was weird or, oh, I

600
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.710
Brittney: Like to go like a bird even they're not

601
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

602
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes you hear my voice or something like when saying this, or whatever. So it's kind of already organic

603
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Oh good, then that might be a good fit.

604
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we've got a plan. Oh, shoot. Oh, she was, had she had an appointment. Anyway, let me let me hear from her. She says she has an intake your time at nine, which means she's going to be done at 10

605
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So ideally it would be a script for the month I'll ask Kate. You tell me. I'll ask do you need me with her in order to write that for her to look for another provider.

606
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or do you want to go with. I can afford and budget once a month and see if she's amenable I do have people doing that, where they're only meeting once a month.

607
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.260
Brittney: Yeah, I might. I might be able to. It would be better if I could do it after my sporadic

608
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:14.940
Brittney: But

609
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.660
Brittney: If I need to see as we go. I'll figure now.

610
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me

611
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.500
Brittney: I obviously don't want to run out of my mouth.

612
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, like I gotta keep track of things here next Friday is to 28

613
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.420

Gwenevere Abriel: Three you know 231 ideal is meeting to 31 at one o'clock right

615
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.100
Brittney: Yeah, that's Monday. Right.

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.170
Brittney: For the Monday session.

617
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she gets paid on Friday to 28

618
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so let me see. She likes that. So it's like get there and then maybe that month can happen, that kind of thing. Let's see what she says.

619
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:53.700
Brittney: Awesome, thank

Gwenevere Abriel: BIANCA

Bianca Garcia: Hello.

626
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:57.570
Bianca Garcia: Hi. How are you, I thought I wouldn't hear you. When you came on, because I'm on my iPhone but I guess not. But I was I was here at 939 20

627
01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Do you run time I saw it was it was me. Sometimes we humans, we don't wrap up, just like that, you know,

628
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.300
Bianca Garcia: No, no worries. Just wanted to let you know.

629
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on time. I saw you. They have this little this little waiting room so I can see who's coming in.

630
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I just needed to kind of wrap up a couple things. Okay. This is excellent. So Bianca, if you can, unless you're holding your 11 month old.

631
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Just put me somewhere static for a little bit like on a shell.

632
01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to open up a note and we'll get started. Okay.

633
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:40.380
Bianca Garcia: Second, let me get this situated slowly.

634
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:03.600
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

635
01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.430
Bianca Garcia: There we go.

636
01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For today, it's okay for today. But in the future you you would want to be looking at me more like an icon, that kind of thing, but

637
01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

638
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:20.820
Bianca Garcia: Why I just usually hold my phone on me. Yeah.

639
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about it later. Let's just get to it. So,

640
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It just makes me nauseous. I look at people all day wiggling around so it makes me nauseous. Um, so just a little introduction. So at least you know who I am. You already heard, I'm in Florida. I've been practicing for over 20

641
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Years. I'm licensed

642
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Marriage and Family Therapist have my license in New Mexico, about two and a half years old and

643
01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:50.820
What

644
01:06:51.960 --> 01:07:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: largely focused on addiction. Not sure what the entry was, but I worked at felony drug court for 14 years as an AP private practitioner worked in residential and outpatient settings with substance use this really been intrigued by it. I just like work with you guys.

645
01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I mean it was everywhere, even when I was working with families or with couples, it seems like if it wasn't right here in the family unit. It was like right here.

646
01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So just like, well, let me understand it more. Let me work with it more. So it's been a population. I love working with, um, I think I mentioned on the phone.

647
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Zoom that I use the phone and saw I like it for for scheduling appointments or if Oh my gosh, I'm running five minutes late, or you might, you might say to me, I'm here in in virtual clinic. I'm stuck here they're taking forever. You can send me a little, little

648
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Bit back

649
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh yeah, it's kind of helpful but there won't be any psychotherapy through texting.

650
01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Like if you have a big fire or like, ah, then I'll just say, Hey, can we meet together and talk there.

651
01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:03.600
Bianca Garcia: Oh, okay. And I was going to do that too. And then I saw you text me and I said, Okay, let me

652
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Know that worked. Um, alright, so let's dive right in here.

653
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So the primary the front end of this is going to be. It'll be

654
01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The progression of your opioid use. I'm going to hear about other substance use and then will dip into family history and we'll set some goals. Okay.

655
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so this, this is really for my review.

656
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It is part of an accreditation standard that we get this done. We don't need the full long story go in more depth when we're meeting in individual therapy.

657
01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So just sort of following along my questions. All right. Actually it's being transcribed. So some of it will write some of it, you'll hear me say weird things like please transcribe verbatim or Clinton nice lifetimes history of something and then because it's being transcribed.

658
01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you came in here. I think I overheard something, how you came in already using buprenorphine. Was it from another program off the streets kind of walk me through that.

659
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:20.340
Bianca Garcia: Yes, I was on another program. Well, I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and I was in a program there for four years and then I just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

660
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:30.300
Bianca Garcia: A year and a half ago, and I had to find another doctor up here because it was kind of hard going back and forth. Um, so yeah, that's where we were at

661
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.300
Bianca Garcia: This doctor that I was with just recently um I didn't feel like I was getting

662
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:47.280
Bianca Garcia: The care. I needed. So I, I, I felt like I was getting like patient profiles and I was not getting counseling or therapy was just like goes to the doctor, get a prescription leave

663
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:58.950
Bianca Garcia: So I was like, I need to find some results. So we had an agreement where I would just see her every 10 days until I would find a new provider and then this is where I found you guys

664
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let me just go through this a little bit. I have Santa.

665
01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Santa Fe and pay for four years. Um, so that is these last four years.

666
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right okay and

667
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You will receiving basically

668
01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:22.590
Medication

669
01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:32.760
Bianca Garcia: Your, your thing with a little cutting out you recited

670
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You received medicated assisted therapy, but no counseling. Correct.

671
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.100
Bianca Garcia: Here. Yes. Now, correct. Okay.

672
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, just please transcribe that she was receiving ma T services, but no therapeutic services. Okay, so now let's go through. Let's go through some industry just thinking about the opioid use

673
01:10:54.060 --> 01:11:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you first use it like 13 wisdom tooth pulled and kind of walking through a few of the large sort of progressions.

674
01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:10.440
Bianca Garcia: Um, no. I was, I was like in possibly my 20s and

675
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:16.620
Bianca Garcia: That's when it started like going around where everybody was like doing it, I guess, and

676
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.700
Bianca Garcia: Then it

677
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Going what

678
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.480
Bianca Garcia: Oh, the prescription pills.

679
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how are they doing it.

680
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:38.910
Bianca Garcia: It was, it was like people weren't hearing of it. And then, and then they're like, what, what there. And then I don't know like the friends, we'd hang out with, they were doing. They were doing the pills and then I tried it. So it was just like the

681
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning.

682
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.470
Bianca Garcia: Or early and that's when I had tried it and then

683
01:11:47.700 --> 01:12:00.750
Bianca Garcia: And then I, I mean, it takes so quickly. Few a month or two, and you're right away, like you know needed you're dependent on it. So it was a Best thing process. Yeah.

684
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So at its worst, let's see. So you've got a month later, right, then you have on it first recreationally when you first did it in your 20s. How did it make you feel

685
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.480
Bianca Garcia: I'm

686
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.410
Bianca Garcia: Like, I guess, really good. Like, it gives you like and then the thing I liked is that

687
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:43.380
Bianca Garcia: Like I would be so high that nobody noticed LIKE I MY EYES. Want to be red. I wouldn't smell. I wouldn't act weird, you know, like drunk people be all drunk and be weird if I was normal, but inside. I felt like this really good. Hi, I guess. And that's what I like the most about it. Got it.

688
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: No one could tell. Yeah, this high, and no one could tell. Got it.

689
01:12:47.070 --> 01:13:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right always calling you out on it. Alright, so at its worst, let's just take that that time of your life. How what how many oxy were you taking a practice as if I can enter whatever it was, how much was sort of that the worst the highest amount you're taking in any given time.

690
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:09.030
Bianca Garcia: And it was like 100 milligrams, or more of

691
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:18.210
Bianca Garcia: Like 10 a day. So it was like, you know, it could be 10 milligrams or 30 milligrams. So yeah, over 100 milligrams a day.

692
01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.520
Bianca Garcia: Of what about oxy cotton oxycodone, or whatever it is.

693
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you didn't. You didn't care. Just as long as it was an opiate you're happy.

694
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:30.660
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

695
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. And was there ever a time that you started to snort smoke the pill, change the ingestion of it.

696
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:42.360
Bianca Garcia: No, it was orally, the whole time.

697
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting pressured or anything.

698
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.990
No. Okay.

699
01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right and and did it progress to experimenting or long term use of heroin.

700
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:05.850
Bianca Garcia: No, I never did heroin never injected hair when no I always

701
01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:22.590
Bianca Garcia: I would overpay for the prescription pills. I didn't care. Most people would stop paying so much and go to the cheaper version. No, I would pay, I would get those, that's all I wanted was that I did not want the heroin.

702
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Planet tonight's live 10 years of heroin, um, any accidental or intentional use of fentanyl

703
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:47.700
Bianca Garcia: I believe one yes they did sell me like these 30s out we're supposed to be like the real thing, but they weren't. They were the fake fentanyl pills, which people weren't aware of yet. Then, and yeah, I didn't even know

704
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Frankie's I've heard some column faking

705
01:14:51.180 --> 01:15:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what year was that so client inadvertently did take an opiate, believing it to be an Aussie WITH FENTANYL in it one time and when was that

Gwenevere Abriel: I do psychotherapy. I don't tell you how to live your life. I'm not a counselor, giving you advice on what to do. We're going to do whatever it is that you work on if there's something

1151
01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That you've noticed keeps getting in the way. Like these cravings keep popping up within focus there for a lot of people. It's around

1152
01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: developmental trauma that they've experienced when you think about your goal around first will do the substance use, like what's your goal around substance use.

1160
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. I don't. I just wanted to touch on that just so lightly. Don't worry, your goal.

1161
01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:43.560
Bianca Garcia: The big

1162
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: One that's sort of going to steer us while we're working together is I plan on getting off this. I'm assuming you mean the

1163
01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.080
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

1164
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.730

Bianca Garcia: I yes I've tried Suboxone and my tongue swell up

1168
01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Oh.

Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

1170
01:54:22.650 --> 01:54:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well shift gears. This is the one that has to do with all that other stuff my anxiety, you know, kind of around when that comes up is it in social

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Settings. Is it

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Whenever I think about something that happened.

1173
01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now just kind of touching base on the mental health peace something really personal for you. You think this is

1174
01:54:46.770 --> 01:54:49.170
Bianca Garcia: Cool. For me, what would you say it all.

1175
01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:49.650
Around

01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Mental health

1177
01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:08.010
Bianca Garcia: Just get therapy for it. They say that's the best help and right now I'm on the waiting list at Universal counseling right now. It's just a the pain or the

1178
01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.610
Bianca Garcia: Prescription management that's called

1179
01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's get, let's get some clarification. So just now. I told you that I'm a therapist, you're going to be seeing me weekly

1180
01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So tell me, tell me what you'd be getting from you.

1181
01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Who there can't be to

1182
01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:32.370

Gwenevere Abriel: They're all getting it.

1185
01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:45.090
Bianca Garcia: Oh yeah, yeah, actually. Yeah, you're right. I don't know how I set it up. But yeah, definitely work with you and see how that goes for unit. Yeah, definitely.

1186
01:55:45.690 --> 01:55:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so it's not just getting the therapy.

1187
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that you want to get from it. What's your goal to get some therapy. Do you think

1188
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:56.910
Bianca Garcia: Well, learn how to cope

1189
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:09.330
Bianca Garcia: Or manage you know thoughts or feelings or how to just live life without first group options. I guess normal. Yeah.

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm gonna say it back to you and see if you like this is going to, we're going to be revisiting this goal month when we review.

1191
01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: How you're doing so it'll sound like this and we can kind of refine it a little bit. Your goal is to learn to cope and manage feelings and live without prescriptions.

1192
01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:39.060
Bianca Garcia: Yeah you're right on it.

1193
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:41.010

01:56:49.920 --> 01:57:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes right away, will be developing we won't do psychotherapy right away what we'll be doing is really getting some emotional regulation skills right in your toolbox immediately.

1197
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll start to recognize them and group, these people are doing what they're feeling better. They're using them. We just have to learn

1198
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll, we'll continue to develop some trust and rapport and then we'll get into sort of kind of where this all came from and we'll get into that together. Okay. Um, let's schedule another session.

1199
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.360
Bianca Garcia: Oh, one more question. One more. But remember,

1200
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Self esteem. From zero to 1010 being I'm the bomb.

1201

01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:39.060
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I don't know. I mean this this time was fine. I mean, I would like little bit more time to get these kids to Psyche talks and be like, hey, because they just woke up when we were like in a hurry. And I was like,

1212
01:58:39.570 --> 01:58:44.940
Bianca Garcia: And I don't want them to interrupt. So I need to talk to them every time I have to have a meeting and

01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:46.080
Bianca Garcia: Get them so

1214
01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:49.890

1215
01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people are trying to get their kids there either of us and everybody has their own little routine so
