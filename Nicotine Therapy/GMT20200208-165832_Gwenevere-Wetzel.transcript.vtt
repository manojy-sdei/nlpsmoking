00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you mean by he's going to edit it.

24
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.180

25
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's talk about him. He's right here. Let's do it differently.

26
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.640
Well,

27
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:59.700
Cynthia We: Like you said that you know I'm just saying, you do a budget and I didn't do it based on like, you know, you're supposed to save receipts to do the Pat do is figure out kind of how much you were paying in the past. So you have an idea.

28
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Of way richer.

29
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.480
Cynthia We: Well, we didn't we just get because we went off of kind of some old numbers we had and what we kind of figured newly okay

30
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't you, why don't we have

31
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.180
Cynthia We: Seeing if that if this is realistic or not.

32
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, how many items do you have left.

33
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.890

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, to add, how many items do you have left. So it's complete to the

35
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.850
Jury

36
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.760
Cynthia We: I don't know, entertainment, I put entertainment. I'm here without a number because yeah

37
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.430

38
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish that let's finish entertainment. And can we just think about it for just this next month and then thinking there's going to be a reality check after that.

39
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.710
Cynthia We: Oh well.

40
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:09.450
Cynthia We: I think that when we, when we were going over it. I wanted it to be our normal budget. Okay. When Scott's working. So this doesn't matter for now because we won't be able to spend on clothes or things like that.

41
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's work it backwards. Let's not get take too much time on analysis work it backwards. How much did you write for housing okay 1650

42
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.010
Cynthia We: That's for read. Yes.

43

46
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.430
Cynthia We: You can go yeah

47
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.210

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Tommy tuition. One more time.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 zero 29 as in

58
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.090
Cynthia We: One to two none. Oh, sorry.

59
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then, um,

60
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me jump down to this other one which I have secretly secretly ugly, ugly for dance tuition.

61
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let's dance.

62
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.760
200

63
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay yeah 200 and just that count costume.

64
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.600
Cynthia We: Know, so we count that as education tuition that we're doing.

65
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what I did is I just happened to putter around this morning and I pulled some things apart, um,

66
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:58.680
Cynthia We: Yeah, I put something for entertainment arts and wreck. I don't know if you want to dance, or if you want to just lose

67
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.630
Cynthia We: Um,

68
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:11.580
Cynthia We: I'll just add it here like this. Just with dance so costumes. Um, OK. So the Nutcracker. They get charged $40 each

69
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:27.270
Cynthia We: So at and then recycles month when they're charging us for costumes this month. Okay, so, so this so you're doing it as a yearly total

70
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.230
Cynthia We: And then we'll divide it right or

71
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, let's just look at it this month we'll get we'll get there. We can edit it.

72
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.560
Cynthia We: We can code up quicker isn't relevant than for this month.

73
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's move on.

74
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.200
Cynthia We: The costumes.

75
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.930
Cynthia We: Are relevant because they are charging us this month.

76
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.250
Cynthia We: So it will be

77
00:07:44.610 --> 00:08:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: At for this month. Let's put it in there. Let's put it inside. I have this little category for dance intuition. I'm. It has to do with something. I'm assuming you both have this shared value. It's not like you're going to not do it. So it's really non negotiable, am I

78
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it's two at this month.

79
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right, um, it goes for custom

80
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.090
Cynthia We: Know Lolo 70 and Tikkun will be at my god

81
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's good for you to hear it. You know, it's this

82
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.710
Cynthia We: Note about it on the front table. Okay.

83
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's that's that's 150 and is that 200 for dance is that every month.

84
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so that's actually. Am I wrong 350

85
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.580
Cynthia We: It's 350 yes it

86
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.750
Cynthia We: Is

87
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.950
Cynthia We: Just 200 so

88
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The groceries, typically a month I plugged in 800 it was random. I know it's not

89
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

90
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.780
Cynthia We: I heard sounds great 800 is

91
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

92
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.120
Cynthia We: Our goal used to be 600 though.

93
00:08:49.020 --> 00:09:02.160
Cynthia We: Well, well, but then we added 200 because I thought that I would like household items such as laundry detergent and paper towels and all of that crap to fall under groceries.

94
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it is

95
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.320
Cynthia We: Oh, good.

96
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.450
Cynthia We: Okay 1000 it's 1000

97
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to come back to it. If this number doesn't work because this, this little thing I did in Excel does all the math for me. Praise Jesus. OK. And then let's go to sell. How much is sell both of you together every month.

98
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Cell phones. Yes.

99
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.280
250 but I don't think it's that much mobile phones.

100
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly how much those three phones electric and gas was 120 or I'm a

101
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:41.850
Cynthia We: Graphic is 120 gas is 70 because sometimes it's 20 and sometimes it's 101 20

102
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you, you. So we're going to say

103
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A 120 a month is that the number we're going to kind of average

104
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes up and down. Do you want to go with me.

105
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Then we have sewer 110 trash watch cable.

106
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Internet. I'm assuming I don't know what you guys are doing over there. Well,

107
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:13.830
Cynthia We: Yeah, we're just doing stuff. But if you add all the Netflix everything up, it comes to subjects 70 $72 right now. Yeah, okay. But that doesn't include internet

108
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go internet

109
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.420
Cynthia We: To put TV in

110
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.620
Cynthia We: Okay so tonight is seven.

111
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.090
Cynthia We: Okay so internet

112
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Cable 72 and then internet is 90. Did you just say

113
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.140
Cynthia We: Yeah, but that's internet it's phone and internet

114
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: 9393 got it. Okay. And then we have car maintenance repair and tires. This I just plugged in a random number and I lost all that work that we had done. We have done. I know everyone all those tire numbers. I could not find that note saved my life.

115
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What is, um, what are we thinking about something like once a year, I think, changing out the tires or something was

116
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.400
Cynthia We: Reached out to to have two cars changing out once a year.

117
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:14.100
Cynthia We: Plus three oil changes each car. Yeah, that's 50 or 60 a pop. Okay. For some reason I have $100 divided when you brought up about about 1200 dollars a month.

118
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.320
So,

119
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:25.830
Cynthia We: You know the thing about that is, we're not going to get tires for 11 months out of the year. So we're just going to roll the number over

120
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.090
Cynthia We: Yeah budget or like we're just keeping money in an envelope kind of thing.

121
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Kinda like that. Keep it like that. So let's just look at the charts. One more time. I apologize, as if it was 12 months. What will we saying for a set of tires.

122
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.210
Cynthia We: 400 for one more. Okay, so

123
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But yeah, there are about about 100. That's all right.

124
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.020
Cynthia We: I mean, I think they're about 60 something but they charge. Other thing.

125
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so it's 800

126
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:55.590
That's

127
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.760
Cynthia We: Each oil change. I think you guys yeah and so 1100 total

128
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you have for tires and oil.

129
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.610
Yeah 1200 total 1200

130
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so karmic. Now, does that count.

131
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't have an emergency piece in it. Um, but that's not a bad. Let's do

132
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.410
Cynthia We: You normally put an emergency, just in case.

133
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:30.480
Cynthia We: In there, or do you just keep that separate because I want you put emergency pieces and all medical stuff and that's

134
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: already going to be a place for last minute emergency do regular expected things. So there's some predictability of little ok we'll go here. We just said.

135
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So basically hundred dollars right

136
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking away. Okay. Dance tuition. I put 350 I'm just running through that I put se supplies of a random number. So tell me what that would be.

137
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:09.090
Cynthia We: Oh, random $120 a month, maybe you're putting their business office, though.

138
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.630
Cynthia We: I'm just put it under Etsy supplies.

139
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And a pet, we want to put like 75 or how much

140
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:23.280
Cynthia We: Yeah, I put 99 for because I don't think we include a cat litter last time.

141
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.770
Cynthia We: It used to be 75

142
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So how much is the bag of kitty litter.

143
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.190
1399

144
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many times do you do you get that once a month.

145
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:44.400
Cynthia We: Or every week. How often once a month or twice a month. Okay, once a month depending on how many people are coming over.

Cynthia We: Did you put on auto insurance under insurance or none.

161
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Of this word insurance here, but I don't know if this is health. Let me add another category here, I've got, we got to do both. Let me add a little row insert and I'll put car insurance Quantico cuesta for that one.

162
00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.490
Cynthia We: A month. What's the number 130

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 134 and then health insurance.

164
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:19.290
Cynthia We: We don't have to pay for that all the time. We won't be yeah my work covers it, and I'm working enough where we don't have to do any co pays. I mean, we don't have to do any supplemental payments. So we haven't had to pay it all year. And we probably won't have to fit this year.

165
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And things like childcare and camp. So sometimes you

216
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:20.640

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, gifts we have birthdays. We have charity category here and gifts white

218
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:35.880
Cynthia We: Wedding coming that we have to buy gifts for two ways. Um so gifts parties gifts old versions will say like

219
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:46.980
Cynthia We: I don't know the wedding, one has to be kind of a big one. Yeah, but that's like once in a blue moon right except they're still

220
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.710
Cynthia We: Right. So if you want to add to wedding gifts. This year, then miscellaneous birthday parties. I mean,

221
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:07.620
Cynthia We: What is 20 we used to have a gifts and celebrations category that included all birthdays all holidays, things like that. Yeah. What do you do with Christmas is that that's its own entity. Right.

222
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so. So let's, um, let's do this. Let's look at because this is your life. This is

223
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oftentimes there's this disconnect with no this is kind of these are the things that happen. So I really kind of think, including birthdays kids going to other birthday parties is important. Do you kind of go, hey, Austin $25 one shirt.

224
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And just about what

226
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And when you're going to a wedding and you want to get someone a gift you go higher. What do you do. Oh, yeah, yeah.

227
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.300
Cynthia We: So it's like a couple hundred bucks.

228
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.050
Cynthia We: I think so, probably a couple hundred bucks each. So to those

229
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.910

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so 30 it okay if it was three packs.

252
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:22.080
Cynthia We: Yeah, we could say two packs and then I could shoot for two paths, because I think that that is my goal to be smoking, much less

253
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:31.230
Cynthia We: I could actually pay attention and then I could actually smoke all those little pieces out in the garage and in the backyard that I like to smoke cigarettes.

254
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said two and a half times $11 2750 a week. Is that right,

271
00:23:59.460 --> 00:23:59.850
Cynthia We: You know,

272
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:01.500
Cynthia We: Really

273
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, so for example out here.

274
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I got one that they slept them up to take him down to Miami, they go see this and then they should let them to Disney because I've got Disney right here. And so they they send them up there to Orlando and I gotta you know pay for these days in the in the hotel and the bundle, but

275
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.600
Cynthia We: No, you don't have anything like that. I mean, next year is going to Costa Rica trip but that's next year when he was in eighth grade.

276
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:48.960
Cynthia We: But there's might take to a camp in the beginning of the year, they had to pay for, but there was like no 150 I don't remember exactly. Okay, somebody just put so should we keep that separate from our you know vacation.

277
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.520
Cynthia We: RTS. Yeah.

278
00:24:50.700 --> 00:25:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I've got, um, let me just come back to this one more time just what did I just say field trip. I've had miscellaneous, miscellaneous

279
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Uber field trip I plugged into hundred but that might not be true. I don't know, because that's a year like how many wouldn't do more than 200 a year for, like, including weird things. It's good. I expected stuff for a kid and. Okay. All right.

280
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:26.100
Cynthia We: And over when he has taken over which she did quite a bit. Last year it was like $13 time

281
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:32.880
Cynthia We: Well with tip is pretty minimal right yeah but you still have to add it

282
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then a college just asking if you guys are thinking about a fund for those guys.

283
00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:54.780
Cynthia We: Well, I mean, my dad is got a college fund for them that's growing and pretty huge right now, but so that's a blessing. We'd still. You never know. So we still would like to do that but

284
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.930
Cynthia We: I'm kind of see, you put away.

285
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not even go there. All right.

286
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.680
Cynthia We: What do you recommend

287
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't I'm man. I'm a behaviorist. This is I'm I'm coming along here just to make this happen. You don't want my financial advice.

288
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.930
Cynthia We: So you don't have anything for that. And we also don't have a 401k or wrong.

289
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stop right now. This might bring up some. Remember I said we're about to dip into stuff that kind of bring up

290
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Things. So here's what I did. I stood I sent over here and I just plugged in numbers I put in college.

291
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I put in 100 401 K put in 100 raw savings switch it Ross's, you know, you're basically you're paying a tax now on income, he put it in a savings. Then when y'all are old, you pull it out. You don't have to pay taxes.

292
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I plugged in 100 because around numbers.

293
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is so that this whole thing my whole list comes to me ask you something. For I say the number

294
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I plugged in. Whoops.

295
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.390
Cynthia We: We still have a lot on here that you probably don't have

296
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I will then tell me

297
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.870
Cynthia We: Okay. Do you have auto insurance get gas and fuel. Yes, the car. You got that. Oh, no.

298
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I put one night. Oh wait, hold on car maintenance. I

299
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.210
Cynthia We: Separate from me.

300
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me add this and

301
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.500
Cynthia We: You added under transportation and then

302
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Maybe that's how I check it out. A car absolutely fuel what she got there.

303
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.650
Cynthia We: 300 a month. Okay.

304
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.550
Cynthia We: Then we got some office office office supplies, ya know,

305
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that

306
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:42.030
Cynthia We: Is that like printer printer a paper. How big is

307
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That different than kind of FC. How is that different

308
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.470
Cynthia We: At all those corner business expenses, it could own thing.

309
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let me go se slash

310
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Business because it's really about busy.

311
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.700
Yeah.

312
00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.880
Cynthia We: You're right, all three business. Yeah.

313
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's let me change because you have that sort of going on too. Don't you, Scott. It's not just as

314
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.370
Cynthia We: Well, probably soon. Yeah, I do.

315
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

316
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just go.

317
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.880
Cynthia We: Just go business. Let's see. Yeah.

318
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What number. Now I had 120. What do we change in that to

319
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.060
Cynthia We: That was

320
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Easy.

321
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.820
Cynthia We: Now what do you is the nation, a month. Right, I'm guessing, Scott. I have no idea.

322
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.300
Cynthia We: Because sometimes I have to buy supplies.

323
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:36.540
Cynthia We: But you don't. But you don't every month. Right. We don't if I get an order I do all expenses.

324
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so more

325
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the okay on an average, take, take the last three months.

326
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:51.600
Cynthia We: It's it is it's expensive because it's a terrible printer is like $100 a month really

327
00:28:52.860 --> 00:29:00.810
Cynthia We: I'm not sure I'm guessing. Okay. So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry $20 for the black ink every month and then the

328
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:10.140
Cynthia We: Color ink is like $70 but that's only every three months or every that's only when you're printing out a 400 page story that you're right.

329
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:21.300
Cynthia We: Right. No, it's not. It's, it's really. Hmm. There's a big difference when you're printing out a 400 page story when you're not going to be using any color increment printing out a form or big story. Let's just buy a new printer.

330
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so this one seems like an interesting one. So we've got a bank and then you said something else. We said the word printer. Is that what you were talking about was the ink.

331
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, paper anything in there. She

332
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:37.830
Can book.

333
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.830
Cynthia We: A ream of paper, a month. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

334
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I see something

335
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oops I scuzzy

336
00:29:51.780 --> 00:30:01.260
Cynthia We: Then you've got your other stuff. I mean, your supplies and your. That's what I was saying for 124

337
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.550
Cynthia We: Right to just say 120 for the whole shebang.

338
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.390
Cynthia We: But if you haven't added prints or

339
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:25.770
Cynthia We: Somehow, obviously it's not the same as remote and it's not, you're not buying all that stuff every month, you're not buying a new inventory every Monday. Nope. I knew that is true stuff every month. Right.

340
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.050
Cynthia We: And if you are, you're right. No, it just depends.

341
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you can do is just take an average. I mean, if you just say we can't get too bogged down, we have to say.

342
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, over the last three months. What was the average amount, taking the low

343
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.340
Cynthia We: But when I say one

344
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I just wrote down 173

345
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that I think that included. Let me see what I've

346
00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:02.040
Cynthia We: Included the ink that I was talking about in the paper and then the clay which is a big expense.

347
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but that's in the 120

348
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Crap. Okay, so I want undo that. So here we go. I put 120

349
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I put plus 20

350
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Money for the

351
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Black. Black

352
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.080
Cynthia We: Well, maybe I'll just stop it and then it won't be an expense. I'm not stopping

353
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.970
And saying you

354
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.450
Cynthia We: plan on spending more than you. So

355
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.290
Okay, so

356
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.110
T

357
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.680
Plus one, Tony. Okay, I

358
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Want one was 23 plus

359
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 I got 173 again. So for business stuff I've got 173

360
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That gives a little bit

361
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.800
Cynthia We: Let's try that and

362
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, you've got actual then you've got this sort of you've got projected then you've got actual and what's the variants. And you can look at that afterwards. But let's let's get some numbers down doing great. Well, as

363
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.440
Cynthia We: Well, under business is

364
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.990
Cynthia We: Photoshop and InDesign design, not the same thing for it.

365
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not so the 120 doesn't cover the

366
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: subscription. So what's Photoshop fee.

367
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.340
By

368
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:54.420
Cynthia We: 20 a month. So I think it's 15 a month and then the InDesign is 20 a month so 35 a month. That's for designing jewelry and photos for your portal. Yeah, maybe it should go under it should go into business probably I

369
00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So ya know I put business supplies slash we got we got all kinds of stuff in there. We got Photoshop and what was the other program.

371
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And that includes so now I just added it first. I had 173 and I'm adding what 35 okay

372
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: To away just what I have to say.

373
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

374
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

375
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What else do you guys have that you hadn't heard

376
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:32.970
Cynthia We: I don't, I just scribble down. I don't have a number for entertainment arts and

377
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:35.940
Cynthia We: Movies.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry I didn't include that. But like, put that

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it. Let me get in here. We'll put

382
00:33:52.380 --> 00:34:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of fun entertainment already embedded in the internet because I think that included Netflix. Right. I think

383
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:04.350
Cynthia We: Or not. But ya know, Netflix is part of the TV's

384
00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:05.820
Cynthia We: Oh, yes.

385
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, I'll say cables TV Netflix is part of that. Yeah. OK, now let's go to, um, what do you want to do for entertainment. What do you guys typically do just your, your coffee count is

386
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.760
Cynthia We: How often do you know that's a whole separate category has her own separate category.

387
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, maybe I should put it right next to cigarettes isn't

388
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.340
Cynthia We: Wrong thing to okay so

389
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll put coffee.

390
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and let's back up to fun. What do we want to do that. What are you already doing that's getting done and nobody's maybe talking about

391
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:58.470
Cynthia We: Nothing, no we're, we've been living broke from past couple months, but

392
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.960
Cynthia We: So is this word dining out goes the dinners.

393
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.530
Yes.

394
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's definitely entertainment.

395
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.210
Cynthia We: Well, I also have food and dining restaurants, but I don't know.

396
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go entertainment dining out okay because let's face it, we do that for entertainment. Yeah.

397
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:19.860
Cynthia We: You're right.

398
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it is like spa kind of things special massages nail salon type of things too, so

399
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.460
Cynthia We: Why I'm also right

400
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:40.320
Cynthia We: Um, I don't get manicures, but that would be included there and

401
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop right there dining and entertainment. Let's just dining. How many times do you go out Mexican Indian child. What are you guys doing

402
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:58.740
Cynthia We: Well, how many times do we, we like to go out. Well, how many as a whole family. We'd like to go out once a week. Yeah. All four of us. Okay.

403
00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about

404
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.620
Cynthia We: 100 bucks maybe well

405
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know. We'll start with that that let's be realistic where give me a restaurant where you all have gone you all enjoy

406
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:20.610
Cynthia We: Well, when were you know valuable and quick. It's all of garden when we're somewhere else. We go to the fancy Italian place, which would be closer to $200 right

407
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:34.110
Cynthia We: Which send me wants to go to once a week, probably, I do. So I go I could go once a month, and I'd be here. So yeah, I would say, let's say, a mean date nights something different, but I would say

408
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:48.810
Cynthia We: We plan on going for, you know, once a week to a nice dinner decent dinner family night out that, yeah, call it a 100 bucks. And if you want to add a little bit for a little fancier place one out of those four times.

409
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.990
Because, you know, then you stopped for pizzas all the time and

410
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.020
Yes.

411
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.570
Cynthia We: Well that's separate, that's fine.

412
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that needs to be part of the dining out. How do you guys feel about that because I'm looking for pizza. And so I mean it is

413
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

414
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's face it, we could stay home. We could prepare a meal but it's like so nice. The kids love it. Maybe you have a set day. Is it like Friday's pizza night and you don't have to wonder what happened. Yes, something sort of set

415
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.960
Cynthia We: Like during the summer buying stuff to go barbecue at the pool.

416
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.060
Cynthia We: Okay, that's, that's, that's kind of eating out so

417
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to

418
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The grocery let's stick with family, the big dinner. Hold on, let me I'm getting lost. We got family dinner where we all go out to an Italian restaurant. How much is that that's once a month. What is that one.

419
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.260
Cynthia We: Okay.

420
00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And all of garden is 100 and that one that type is once a week. Is that right. Mm hmm. Okay.

421
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.710
Cynthia We: Except not that that we could

422
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.290
Cynthia We: So that would be

423
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, got it.

424
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

425
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that now you both willing to say the week that you do a pizza is that one's taking the place of an evening out at this point is that taking the place of it. No, it's on pizzas pretty cheap, but it's very to you guys.

442
00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How comfortable are you saying how much you think you're going to be bringing in just the stable consistent income coming in from Scott. What do you think it will be a month, I wrote, I wrote seven but I made that up. That's random. What do you think it's going to be

443
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.970
Cynthia We: When I well it's gonna be taking home. Well, at least.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me add that, how much is how much you're paying for medical on a regular basis.

449
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.260
Cynthia We: Oh, well we divided it up the dentist. Dr. And I care and pharmacy, but you want to combine them.

457
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:38.310
Cynthia We: That's what he says that's without any that's our regular payment for the dentist that we're on a plan for every month doesn't include any other visits that doesn't include cavities.

458
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so start getting that number one more time. The dentist.

459
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.780

460
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.630
Cynthia We: I care.

461
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.280
Cynthia We: When

462
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.730

Cynthia We: She's got $30 for I care that can be you and Lola includes me and a little contacts and divided by a year for you. Yeah. Oh, I don't think that's right. It's done. We have pharmacy slash medicine, meaning pharmacy stuff as well as anything, I guess, add bills and

464
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:21.990
Cynthia We: Stuff like that. We have 150 5% Wait what's for 65 divided by 12 because I think I don't have the right. I think that's an old numbering

465
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Force with it so 465 divided by 1238 75

466
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.170
Cynthia We: Okay, so that's our IQ.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay sub

492
00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:38.100
Cynthia We: Was gonna, I don't think you do that every month. I think you do that when you're working, you do it when kids go back to school. You spend a little bit

493
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Clothing clothing so there's a little disconnect here on the clothing so little, little folks little goodies. They grow.

494
00:44:51.960 --> 00:45:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Up. They run in their socks and they get holes new underwear. They, they are kind of stain makers.

495
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we thinking on that. Is there something kind of emotional going on right now. Like I had my head down.

496
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.600
Cynthia We: It used to be 72 for all four of us.

497
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I will tell you right now, I'm looking at a number that leaves room for 100 okay that

498
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:22.770
That's

499
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to freak you out and we'll go back and change it. This number freaks you out.

500
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.020
Cynthia We: What did we did we say anything about entertainment arts and rec

501

502
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, like if you had a racquetball membership or golf or something like that, you know, we would want to plug that in. But right now it's it's at seven.

503
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You have gym membership. What's that we watch

507
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I just put Jim I stuck it under dance here. But yeah, I've got this neat little system, I can just type it in as a number of world.

508
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:07.920
Okay.

509
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:09.780
Cynthia We: That's all right.

510
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get an impression, so that we can adjust things now. Now let me just say the number and then let's back up to things that you're like oh now I want to make a change.

511
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay you ready

514
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't believe that never so I

515
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:50.880
Cynthia We: Basically have to work dead. If I don't take in 100 but don't bring in 120 every year. That's pressure thing that's

516
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So, but remember I plug things in just now without your permission I can take them right back out.

517
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:05.820
Cynthia We: But, but there's also about right though it feels like that's very close to what we actually already, and we were sending everything he made

518
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I was plugging in randomly and there's a psychological thing going on right now, which I want to address. But remember, I plugged in squirreling away college 100 a month for one k 100 on savings 100

519
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And just for miscellaneous was 100 and I

520
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:38.880
Cynthia We: Don't think I have. I don't think I have subscription that parts missing, what was that one more time for 48 subscriptions for all you just a little no no stuff where you don't have to guess an apple kids we have 40 you'd like

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's back. Is it. Yeah.

522
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just do this.

523
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.700
Minus nine two.

524
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:53.310
So,

525
00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Room for variance 2741 so

526
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.170
Garden outdoor

527
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:08.580
Supplies

528
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we talk a little bit about what just happened like you just got Eric right

529
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Overwhelmed

530
00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:20.280
Yeah.

531
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that notion of remember when you were doing the the inventory

532
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding that in in your mind for a second and then also right next to it hold

533
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The. I don't know whether it was comfort. Remember, I'm making stuff up here, I'm having to pull from just fragments of conversations but I'm just thinking right now hold that in your awareness and then hold this notion of

534
00:48:49.830 --> 00:49:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy handle it and take care of it that notion of wanting to not notice how uncomfortable it is right now like just, I don't want to deal with it. I don't want to think about it, it's so much pressure.

535
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, am I getting close. Scott, like it's a lot of pressure on you.

536
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:07.680
Yeah.

537
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:10.080
Yeah.

538
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the reality is, Scott.

539
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been doing it.

540
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And everything is going to be okay.

541
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But this this

542
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncertainty that you bumped into because your particular career. There isn't just the solid salary that goes on. But the reality is you have handled it.

543
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're, you're okay Everything's okay.

544
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's scary. You think, but that means I have to do this. And once we get a, get $1,000 in our pocket. Then we start to think, I got to keep that thousand dollars in my pocket and it messes with our head.

545
00:49:55.230 --> 00:50:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you say this, this stress worrying about the future in this variability is is overwhelming because it's happened just now that just hits you hard. Soon as I said, the number right and send you knew it was going to happen. Right.

546
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: If we say it's going to be okay. It's gonna it's gonna come in. I mean, what are you going to go do. You're going to go look for a different job. No, you're just gonna just like the rest of us.

547
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we don't know if we're going to get hit by a bus today. We really don't. Okay, we just, we can't get up in that that mystery of the unknown in the future we stay right here and we say

548
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my budget. This is what I'm going to do, I'm going to give up. I'm going to go to work. I'm going to get it done. What we're doing today is we're working out.

549
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The moments in between. When you get scared, Scott.

550
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: These feelings come up and you're long distance and you're you're somewhere away and this feeling comes up. This is where the therapy comes in handy is how you

551
00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Manage that welling up of fear and concern and Cindy, right. How will you hold on to yourself and not not doubt that

552
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We have the budget be able. This is the therapy right this is the healing. We say, I can, I can hear your stress. I can hear your concern, everything's going to be okay. And this is where we can negotiate.

553
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we going to say to each other so that we don't do it the way we've always been doing it.

554
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Clearly have enough money.

555
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:26.400
Okay, you do

556
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can see, did you notice Scott when you were doing the survey that some things came up. Did you look at it all.

557
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.030
Cynthia We: At all. You have the survey.

558
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I was so you said that. Yeah, yeah.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:58.920
Cynthia We: Um,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.090
Cynthia We: It seems

564
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.970
Cynthia We: Sort of. It makes sense and

565
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.840
Cynthia We: Yeah, I mean, it makes more sense than not.

566
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:26.160
Cynthia We: You know, I can get little issues about you know money worship and no one likes to take them, stuff like that, and this and that. But, um, and, like how some of the things were worded, but it makes sense. I'm like, I came up like my strongest

567
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.670
Cynthia We: Issue category, meaning

568
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.940
Cynthia We: Vigilance wires further inquiry.

569
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.660
Cynthia We: Vigilance that makes perfect sense.

570
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:52.530
Cynthia We: The lowest money status. I don't have a concern about money status or worries about that. I think that makes sense and the money worship category. A lot of my strong extreme reactions, um,

571
00:52:53.790 --> 00:53:02.760
Cynthia We: It makes sense. I, I guess I have a problem with the money worship, say, I think it's what word worship. Yeah. Maybe he needs mine. Ultimately, I know that description.

572
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I share some summary as far

573
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.790
Cynthia We: He hasn't seen my neither

574
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So that's what I'll do. Let me do a little a, little a little, little summary on the money vigilance. Okay.

575
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's kind of where you had a high point that departed from Cindy and I will tell you there is a lot of overlap. Okay, which could be

576
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Also means that it's not complimentary, which means. Oh, great. You enjoyed this role, I don't have to do it. So you guys might be frank, like at a crossroads meaning neither one of you want to be doing this one particular thing. So I don't know, but so let's look at this

577
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:49.770
Cynthia We: He just said, I'm not vigilant, so it can't be right. I didn't see you know vigilant with that.

578
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: As well. I didn't check the numbers. I will be honest, I didn't cross check him so money vigilance.

579
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The money different type of person there alert watchful unconcerned about their financial welfare and they believe it's important to save and for people to work for their money and not be given financial handouts. If they can't pay cash for something they won't buy it.

580
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:17.820
Cynthia We: And then

581
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.940
Cynthia We: Sound like me at all. So why did I score so high.

582
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:31.710
Cynthia We: We don't completely. Honestly, no, I get a score really high and you start to answer how you think you should be no I didn't. I was very aware

583
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take it in just these are brand new concepts and i think i think they might be useful. So try it on never remember not nobody is an absolute so you try it on.

584
00:54:45.120 --> 00:55:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You keep what's worth keeping. And you just blow the rest away. Okay, just take on what the portion that's true for you. It's just a discussion that maybe you've never had before. And so it's it's it's just a place to them, Depart from I don't get hung up on him. Okay, so

585
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We covered the cash part if you're so the other thing you want. Let's say if you can't pay cash for something you may not buy it, you're less likely likely to buy on credit

586
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So as a result of money vigilant person have higher income and higher net worth. They also bought have a tendency to be anxious and secretive about their financial status with people outside of those closest to them.

587
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're less likely to lie to their spouse about spending behaviors money vigilance appears to be a protective factor in the money vigilant.

588
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: In that the money vigilant are significantly less likely to spend compulsively gamble excessively enable others financially and ignore their finances.

589
00:55:50.700 --> 00:56:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: While such an approach encourages saving and frugality excessive worry Enos, or anxiety could keep someone from enjoying the benefits and sense of security that money can provide

590
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I, I'm wondering, Scott, what's coming up for you right now. I think I'm imagining a lot. What's coming up for you.

591
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.160
Cynthia We: Oh, well, what you read that. That sounds like me, doesn't it.

592
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so let's keep going. So I'm not going to read anything about status that was just like, not a thing.

593
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But this money worship, there's this share amount of overlap with you to write if that was of it. There's, there's a there was a high high for both. So let me just read a little bit on now is that okay

594
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So weird. It's a weird word right you don't think you worship it but whatever it is, the term someone came up with it. So at the core

595
00:56:48.300 --> 00:57:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Money worship source are convinced this is this one might hit home for you too. Okay. As I looked at the some of the the scores that you guys wrote, and I want to go into detail with them if we, with our whole two minutes we have

596
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So at their core money worshippers are convinced that the key to happiness.

597
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And the solution to all their problems is having more money.

598
00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed in one of the notes that you because you guys haven't looked at him. I can show you what you guys scored with is pretty high overlap with you too.

599
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this belief that it will bring happiness at the same time they believe that one can never have enough money.

600
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And they will never really be able to afford the things they want in life, the tension between believing that more money and the things

601
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Will make one happier in the sense that one will never have enough money, Kim resulting chronic overspending in an attempt to buy happiness.

602
00:57:52.320 --> 00:58:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Money. We're worshippers are more likely to have lower income lower net worth, and to be trapped in a cycle of revolving credit card debt.

603
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Money worshippers are also more likely to spend impulsively hoard possessions put work ahead of their family relationships, try to ignore or forget about their financial situation give money to others, even though they can't afford it and be financially.

604
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Dependent on others. That's a hard one for me to look at that was hard.

605
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy what's coming up for you.

606
00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:32.700
Cynthia We: Well, that sounds more like me than the other one.

607
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And

608
00:58:39.870 --> 00:59:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I've read about the fact that the statistical analysis of when the belief is that happiness will be driven and is the driving force right that the money is the driving force, it isn't actually the result. So that might really slap you in the face. It doesn't. It doesn't.

609
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you end up coming to me and you say, you know what, we took some time and we reflected back on on when because I've been with your minutes Andy Right. And there was income coming in.

610
00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it a happy.

611
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Was everything. Okay. Is it right

612
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.050
Cynthia We: I know that money yeah I know that money doesn't

613
00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:30.390
Cynthia We: Make you happy in that you can watch it. Yeah, I know that money doesn't isn't the sole

614
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:36.810
Cynthia We: Reason that people are happy. But I think that it makes us worry less

615
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.250
Cynthia We: And makes us fight last. Well, no, it doesn't make us

616
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been with this. I've been reading

617
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This reality check. And so this is stuff that's very complicated because it can be

618
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Power, it can be

619
00:59:55.410 --> 01:00:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, what about if it's freedom to use substances. I don't want the free will. I say, I want the freedom, but what if I have it. What will I do

620
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand this is complicated. I think being really gentle and compassionate about it is the way to go. This is powerful stuff.

621
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me tell you a couple things that I signed on to this. Did you know that both of you said you feel strongly about this and Scott, maybe you don't know those things would get better if I had more money, both of you said, I strongly agree.

622
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you you both believe that remember what I just covered, though.

623
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going. Another one important on on a high score more money will make you happier.

624
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Great you agreed. And in fact, that one's actually spot on both of you.

625
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Spot on. Cindy, it is wrong to ask others how much money they have. And I wondered if it was okay to talk about it in here. So the

626
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Difference in here to talk about

627
01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah but but it has to do with this possible shame piece right it's

628
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that means if I don't have it, then I'm what right if I could you know it's it's a changing things we got to see how it affects the self concept. And did you know, Cindy that Scott wrote more money will make you happier.

629
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you, but

630
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard to be poor and happy.

631
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:53.280
Cynthia We: Well, said that, yes, we

632
01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Agree. Go ahead, Scott.

633
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.250
Cynthia We: Which one was that that you just read more money will make you happier.

634
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me get to it. Yeah. Next six

635
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: She writes

636
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so interesting, like put agree.

637
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:12.570
Cynthia We: Not strongly agree but agreed.

638
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, sir.

639
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, sir. Both of you did, yeah.

640
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:21.870
Cynthia We: I mean my belief is is more in line with the money buys freedom.

641
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:26.970
Cynthia We: That one that's freedom, more than happiness freedom.

642
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:28.980
And and if

643
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You put in fact you put strongly agree, what do you think your wife, but

644
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.300
For freedom.

645
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I would assume close to the same she did.

646
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:53.730
Cynthia We: She know we've had that conversation. Many times we both don't think that advise you, if you can't buy happiness. We both know that there's a lot of unhappy millionaires out there and there's happy homeless people out there. But generally speaking,

647
01:02:54.150 --> 01:03:00.120
Cynthia We: In my opinion, it buys a less stressful life doesn't guarantee it.

648
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's

649
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:14.910
Cynthia We: Walk and talk without being on edge and stressed out and anxious all the time if I if I had a decent bank account. I feel my personality would be different. Uh huh. Yeah.

650
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree, it

651
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.750
Cynthia We: Doesn't mean we wouldn't argue doesn't mean no other issue, but

652
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like we're heading in that direction that at least doing this is moving in the correct direction, of course. Okay, so there's also some departures. Are you interested in where there's some recent departures kind of significant significant ones. I thought, let's look at 28

653
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You should always look for the best deal before buying something, even if it takes more time really strongly. Well, you knew that was coming Sunday, right. Mm hmm.

654
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I remember hearing you that it's it's

655
01:03:54.630 --> 01:04:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm driving a particular place like that extra effort piece in there and there was this discussion about, well, then he might take over this role, but can he do that role. Once he's working so it's there. It's there Kevin forgotten that that was a sticky point. Okay.

656
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe being able to say the nuance of of the price point of what that differences and the impact that it may have on quality of life time spent with kids being able to prepare the dinner, there might actually be a value.

657
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's a little bit more intangible to grab that we could sit down and we can pinpoint but

658
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, Cindy for you. It's you disagree a little right you have you have your, your, sort of register a little different than than he does. So let me look at another one that's interesting here.

659
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This was kind of a departure 35

660
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see 35. What did you do, you said agree a little

661
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay, let's see 3535 it is okay to keep secrets from your

662
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Partner around money.

663
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:09.420
Cynthia We: Yeah.

664
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And Scott, you said strongly disagree strongly disagree.

665
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this at the heart of what's going on right there.

666
01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.620
Cynthia We: The thing. It's a big trust issue.

667
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.610
Yeah.

668
01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's

669
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.020
Cynthia We: You know, very damaging trust issue.

670
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:29.670
Um,

671
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:41.940
Cynthia We: I don't know about keeping i don't think secrets is the right way to say that. But I don't think that Scott needs to know every time I spent $24 on lip gloss.

672
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:47.460
Cynthia We: You know, like I feel like there are some things that are personal and

673
01:05:48.720 --> 01:06:04.350
Cynthia We: I might. I might have it. I have a different value that I placed different value on this than he does. And I know that, and I don't want to upset him like so. So he just it's it falls under the realm of none of his business. I think

674
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.000
Cynthia We: For manicures he freaked

675
01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.210
Cynthia We: Out if I went and spent money on manicure. Notice it was in the budget.

676
01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So just generic so wait

677
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:16.620
Cynthia We: The nuts. Just don't have Mad Money, we don't have Mad Money category.

678
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: 20 $700 sitting here with no place to go right now.

679
01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:24.120
Cynthia We: Well, well.

680
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:27.480
Cynthia We: Well,

681
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. But look at what's going on. This is the stuff right now that you'll end up repeating the same things.

682
01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The tension will show up. You're going to say, I don't want to have to answer to, to where I just spent that something inside of you happens, Cindy. Something happens like I'm not going to

683
01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it's personal. And I don't know if that's a piece of the shame piece, like, then I have to hear you don't deserve lip gloss. You don't deserve a manicure to treat

684
01:06:52.080 --> 01:07:00.810
Cynthia We: Because we're not working. So you shouldn't like that's all it's all in my own head. It's not necessarily what you're saying, but I'm

685
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where the disconnect happens so it can change, like, on one hand we're saying we're going to, we're going to stick to a budget, but other things need to be going on to around around the communication and a change in

686
01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The meaning that you make when feelings come up the meaning that each of you make when you hear something that thing's

687
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta do it differently. We've got to change the filter. And that's the work that's that couples therapy piece right I've gotta gotta shift that

688
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the end goal is what, why are you guys bothering to to do this. Why are we meeting here today. What's really the destiny, the destination. Rather, what are we doing

689
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.620
Cynthia We: To make our life more peaceful

690
01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:52.830
Because I think we would like to stay together.

691
01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.750
Cynthia We: To be more on the same page with everything. Same page. Well, that's a general thing, like you said. But yeah, so

692
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me stop there with the same page. Same page. Now, you, you, I assume you accept that your belief systems and you can see it in here. They there is no possible way you didn't grow up in the same household

693
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just impossible to have the same value system even in the same family. There's going to be people in their life.

694
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to be off even even siblings, etc. So

695
01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you accept that there is a page that it's this generous sort of gift where you say this is an important thing for Cindy that she had this discretionary piece where she doesn't have this fusion this invasion this inquiry into for whatever reasons and you just sort of gently say

696
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come to her thing. And I want to show her loving kindness and I won't, I won't go in that. Right. That's a boundary thing. Let's call it that, and the other way around. Cindy is

697
01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To generously be looking at him and be saying he's worried the pressure is on him 12,000 9000 even seven even five is up.

698
01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot of pressure. And so you do that for him to new gently sort of say, Man, I get that pressure and that must be hard and you don't turn it into anything else you lovingly acknowledge that this person has this pressure this this thing, the same way if you have your thing.

699
01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense. Okay.

700
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How about you saw is that kind of seemed like we could work on doing those also

701
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:43.950
Cynthia We: Go. Oh, yeah.

702
01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:46.530
Cynthia We: Yeah.

703
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get I hear it. I hear the trust thing I hear it.

704
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I do

705
01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:59.190
Cynthia We: It's, um, I have a

706
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.270
Cynthia We: I don't feel great when

707
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:16.320
Cynthia We: When my concern for budget or what spent or my surprise, it's something that's spent that I didn't know about. And it's not just a

708
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:26.430
Cynthia We: As easy and smaller private pops up a lot when I'm surprised with things and sometimes in the strangest moments of

709
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:32.760
Cynthia We: Being broke crazy things pop up and things like that in the past but i just i have

710
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:47.580
Cynthia We: I understand, having some of your own things that you would do that I may not think are necessarily whatever's but I guess I don't like that every inquiry. I make

711
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:54.330
Cynthia We: Is categorized as an invasion of privacy or I'm being controlling

712
01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.030
Cynthia We: It sounds like it when you say, oh, I don't think he has to know that I bought lip gloss.

713
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.520
Cynthia We: And I really don't.

714
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:07.710
Cynthia We: But I am we're doing a budget and

715
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:16.110
Cynthia We: It's since I have everything on the table, kind of thing is cool if you want. If you have an accurate budget right it's math.

716
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:26.370
Cynthia We: Um, if you just glob of a group and say, hey, this is your personal discretionary spending. It's 100 bucks blind. Well, then maybe talk about something like that.

717
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of you would have it, but there's something also about, you know, remember I was talking about last time. Is this the time for, you know, organic homemade pasta or is it a time to kind of pull in a little bit. It's changed, obviously. But, um, but this this idea of

718
01:11:47.370 --> 01:12:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I haven't heard from from either one of you that there is an ism like a shopping addiction kind of thing going on here. I'm not hearing this someone's a gambler. I'm not hearing the big issue that could just do real like who can really

719
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.590
Cynthia We: Like that. I think that

720
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:13.740
Cynthia We: We all know that I have gone on retail therapy binges

721
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.210
Cynthia We: So, so

722
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.090
Cynthia We: I am a diamond member at ultra

723
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.940
Cynthia We: This year for the first time ever.

724
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:27.180
Cynthia We: Which is very exciting because I get a whole bunch of benefits, but it's also

725
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.680
Cynthia We: Awful that I spent so much money also that I'm a diamond.

726
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.970
Cynthia We: Well, you know, if everything's fine and dandy.

727
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.450
Cynthia We: Well, it was fine and dandy for the last year. That's why I'm

728
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.660
Cynthia We: Not if you don't have anything saved it wasn't

729
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So how come I don't have that on this this list. The what he just said is that on here helping me

730
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:54.840
Cynthia We: We don't have enough but we didn't give him. We didn't talk about that category.

731
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about it.

732
01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.590
Cynthia We: I didn't know if you were trying to say shampoo and stuff falls under home supply

733
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.480
Cynthia We: I didn't say

734
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot. I'm going to put a

735
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We call this self.

736
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:16.950
Cynthia We: Care mad care people care or health and beauty. Okay, it's not care.

737
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now for you. I'm insert I think each of you need to have some sort of discretionary

738
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.090
Cynthia We: Yes. Because Scott should get massages. Then he could use that money.

739
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you know okay so

740
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got Scott

741
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:37.230
Cynthia We: He doesn't believe like

742
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.650
Cynthia We: He has the money to do these things self care thing first thing off my list when I'm

743
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.730
Cynthia We: That kind of thing. But we're not talking about when we're

744
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.040
Cynthia We: Talking about regularly.

745
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have how much. So let's just

746
01:13:56.370 --> 01:14:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure this out. Remember, we have right now 2700 that doesn't have a place to go. So what do you want to do.

747
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: For city discretion Scott discretion.

748
01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And Cindy. This is the crux of it. Let me just throw this out here.

749
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no I deserve. There's none of it. It's just this. It's, I made a commitment. I'm going to spend this that includes sitting with the discomfort.

750
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Of not being able to go and do more. It's a commitment to doing it not, I deserve. It's just, it's just that might be really uncomfortable, but that I think is what might be going on right now is

751
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the piece you stick with it. You honor that he's right. We just said he's kind of that visualizing part. He's looking. He's anxious acknowledging it and respecting it

752
01:14:55.470 --> 01:15:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not enjoying that anxiety, you're not enjoying not being able to go have these sort of maybe luxury self care whatever pamper things. Also, if you are uncomfortable. It's not like one of you is just to

753
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it's going to be uncomfortable for both of you here and there. Okay, so let's be honest and talk about what you can do, Cindy. It's both a stretch and

754
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to experience himself growth and same with you, Scott. I mean, self care. I mean, I guess, you know, maybe I'm used to preach in it to my clients, it is important that we have some fun and we treat our bodies nicely.

755
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That we enjoy notice. Remember when you were reading when I was telling you that they don't get to enjoy the benefit of the money.

756
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Geez, did you hear any of that. Yeah.

757
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That along the way this this

758
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Standard of living isn't enjoy

759
01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You are a talented man who gets to be in his field and is a really good provider for his family. You get to enjoy it. I want you to enjoy it.

760
01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you.

761
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:14.880
Cynthia We: I don't know. I'm trying to balance out whether I would enjoy

762
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:25.950
Cynthia We: I mean, I know if she's perfect life, I'd have be able to enjoy things at times for hobbies, which I don't do or don't have. I don't have that personal time but

763
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:38.820
Cynthia We: I'm trying to figure out if but what's worth more to me having a bigger savings account and the security and the stability of the future and walking around competent with that. Or I'm having a massage every month.

764
01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And that is definitely your choice that is not Cindy's, you don't have to. Neither one of you have to agree on. This is it. This is this money makes me feel good. I don't want to hear your crap.

765
01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This one makes me feel good. I don't want to hear your crap, right, we get to do that and it's beautiful. You guys are different, and it is where this nice compatibility comes in.

766
01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so she brings to this ability to be a reminder of being in the moment and enjoying sort of these things that life has to offer being present.

767
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And he gets to bring this concept of security to this relationship, Cindy. That is probably pretty convenient. So the home isn't lost and everything. We get to him for this tuition is beautiful. This compatibility. It's not ugly. It's good.

768
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's it. When you own that. And that's your truth. And for a while for you. It's, I want to have $10,000 sitting in savings and and then I then I'll start plugging in a hobbies. Okay.

769
01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. Thanks. Let's get there.

770
01:17:50.850 --> 01:18:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do, how much do you want for you just, this is your discretion extra squirreling I call it extra saving extra, you know, what do you want to do indulge in what you want. What is it,

771
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.500
Cynthia We: What you're asking me what I want to do.

772
01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: How much do you want, save that you would give yourself. Notice how you said, I don't have any personal time and I don't do my hobbies that might give yourself permission to start to do them.

773
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:33.240
Cynthia We: I don't, I would assume somewhere between 1500 bucks a month. Okay, got it. What, what, just

774
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Know for

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:38.160
Cynthia We: What is that

777
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Scott are you worried that that number is too high and

778
01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:45.240
Cynthia We: Low. That's my. No, I mean that

779
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:47.580
Cynthia We: You know,

780
01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:52.830
Cynthia We: I'm thinking there's gonna be a lot of adjustments, um,

781
01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's okay, we just said this 27 floating around, that's just fine, but

782
01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:00.960
Cynthia We: But I

783
01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What

784
01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:05.310
Cynthia We: I need to tell you that I want to say more than 27

785
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.610

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is this is who we are. What are we going to try and pretend this isn't who we are. This is what

Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just tell you what what just happened with our number. Okay, um,

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I've got 1200 I've got $1,200

818
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And now this right now. It's at Member there's little bits going college 401K. Those were, you know, you can set those up and blah, blah, blah, blah, which might add to your sense of security Scott also because you can't grab them back.

819
01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right now there's 1200 dollars and Mike, you guys are with me on that one. That is still not allocated Cindy, I can

820
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.930
I can

821
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.510
Cynthia We: I can make that smaller

822
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:02.250
Cynthia We: What do you mean, I mean, I don't have to have 100 a week. Oh, when he's not working.

823
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well on there's 1200 available right now.

824
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:08.100
Cynthia We: But that's not enough to say when you don't work sometimes

825
01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys like this budget so far. Does it seem realistic where you indulge in some

826
01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.440
Cynthia We: Very realistic but it's not what what you

827
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, you want saving anything

828
01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:26.220
Cynthia We: I felt

829
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to feel good, it's going to feel good. You're going to see it go up, you're going to see it go up. So let's do one more piece, you guys are doing great. You're so brave.

830
01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk about the 1200 dollars, Cindy. You guys face each other face each other, Cindy. I want you to tell him the truth about this 1200 dollars. I want to keep it. I want to just stick it in an envelope. Once you tell him what you want to do with this extra 1200 dollars.

831
01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now allocated.

832
01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:04.350
Cynthia We: Tell them in savings that we do not cut a separate account far away.

833
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So Scott, let's use the mirroring skill share with her. What you just heard if I hear you correctly, you want this 1200 dollars to go into savings that we can't touch that it's in a

834
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In a savings that you know you'll be penalized if you take it up to some

835
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:29.850
Cynthia We: Yes, well, you didn't say that you I didn't say that, because I think it should be our emergency fund first. So when work is not happening. And then

836
01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.000
Cynthia We: Why did we put it in that kind of okay so you said that you thought we were

837
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to get I'm going to write it be neat. Yeah, I'm an emergency fund. Sorry, Scott. I do think something needs to be in there.

838
01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get into how much cash should be just floating around for sitting in a in a checking you want 500 sitting there. You want 1000. What do you think for just floating I've wondered

839
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens to you around 500 Scotty you getting panicked what's happening.

840
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.500
Cynthia We: Well, I think we're at a money.

841
01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have the 1200 allocated so I can pull from there. Well,

842
01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.120
Okay.

843
01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:18.690
Cynthia We: So we're talking about putting whatever's left into a place we can't touch. Is that what you're saying, no, I'm trying to, I'm not saying, well, I have some in the checking account.

844
01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.760
Cynthia We: That you can touch.

845
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you what I've done, because I'm over here, doing things and you know if you can hold what you guys know what I'm doing here. So what I just did is I added another spot and I just said this is the stuff. It just sits floating in the

846
01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting in the checking hands off watch

847
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.820
Cynthia We: Well, I don't think that's possible.

848
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, watch hands off.

849
01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Because in an envelope whatever is cash Cindy's going to do this, whatever she's in charge of it. Let's just go with me on this. And then at the end of the month.

850
01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a conversation. What do you do with that as a rollover if it's actually 600 volt. Let's grab that we have an agreement, an extra 100 is going to be sent over over here.

851
01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense. So you always want to keep 500 in the checking. Are we on the same page. Yes.

852
01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. It doesn't drop below that if an emergency happens. This is how it might go if it's not on your list of emergency like going into urgent care then for every hundred dollars you wait a day and you talk to each other.

853
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And what happens when I say that that $500

854
01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. If it's not emergent and they're really, you know, it's not some sale that's ending and you can really sort of get behind.

855
01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to think about whether this is an impulse buy for every hundred dollars. Let's wait a day and really see if this is something that we want to spend

856
01:26:50.490 --> 01:27:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If you guys say that's kind of weird kind of random, but let's do it. That might increase once you say we're going to do this thing. Now, the pressure and the insults and all of that on one another kind of goes around

857
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: 500 stays there. Something cool happens. Ooh, there's this neat play. Oh my gosh, there's someone we both love that's coming into town.

858
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys are going to talk about it. Right. It's going to be a $250 ticket fee or something. Well, what do you guys thinking you're going to take at least a couple days to talk about it, think about it and share your values around it.

859
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well as I'm saying that is an idea. What do you guys think and

860
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:41.070
Cynthia We: I think it's a great idea. I think Scott probably believes that I won't do. Oh yeah, I think it's a good idea if it's stuck to

861
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to know right now on to change the number two 700

862
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Was 1200 up just changed it. Now I got $700 floating around.

863
01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so I'm Cindy.

864
01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn towards your husband and you were about to tell him you were about to tell her. Okay, so you you're okay with this 700 central part anymore. Going to savings that we can't get our hands on. Is that, is that okay, Cindy that you

865
01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.980
Cynthia We: Know it I'm okay with that 700 going to savings that we can't cut

866
01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: In addition, now

867
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: He had 1500 that he gets to lock up in a CD for six months, three months, whatever he wants to do. That's his business.

868
01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you can't touch those because they're

869
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:27.690
Yeah.

870
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In addition, so we're going to change his number Sabrina changed 1500 to

871
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: 2200

872
01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.070
Every month

873
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to put away. Is that okay

874
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:49.530
Cynthia We: So that's my discretionary money, saying, yeah.

875
01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that feel better.

876
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.290
Cynthia We: Of course,

877
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.600
Cynthia We: I mean, yeah.

878
01:28:59.220 --> 01:28:59.490
Okay.

879
01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy, look at him and tell him, will you be able to do

880
01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That

881
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave yourself 400 later. Are you going to say how could you it's not fares are going to be out there.

882
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's not for him and he's going to put it in savings.

883
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that, right, I mean,

884
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

885
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he needs it.

886
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, tolerance, okay for security. It's not the same as yours. You have ability just sort of maybe compartmentalize easier. You can see something in the moment you can be really present with it right here. He doesn't have that same thing

887
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You agree.

888
01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:43.110
Cynthia We: With that

889
01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:45.390
Cynthia We: I feel like

890
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:54.060
Cynthia We: It'd be upset that I'm not feeling the same way that I don't want to save my discretionary money. No.

891
01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's check that out. All right. Let's find out. So ask them a direct question I'm right here look at each other.

892
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at each other, asked asking your question.

893
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:06.000
Cynthia We: Do you believe that I

894
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.870
Cynthia We: should save my money. Let's save my money to my discretionary money goes up to you.

895
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:18.360
Will you have an opinion about me. If I go

896
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:25.890
Cynthia We: A bad word. Yeah, we'd be mad if I don't say that.

897
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.080
Cynthia We: No.

898
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:31.980
Cynthia We: Woody what

899
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.060
Cynthia We: Do you believe that I can stay in that amount of money.

900
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:45.960
Cynthia We: $400 of just whatever a month. When am I just not a week. It's a month. Yeah. Do you think you should easily be to stay in that

901
01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:51.450
Cynthia We: I think it could be less. But if you know, whatever. Um,

902
01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:59.940
Cynthia We: I think it could be less stupid. I want to succeed. Now I can see me so that I do not

903
01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Write me just so key.

904
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep in mind, Scott, you were doing zero you're about to do 2200 a month.

905
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have 26

906
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.920
But you're going to have a chunk of change here in a minute. Right.

907
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Money hundred times 12 $26,000

908
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And we can look at this again after month, we can say what what worked, what didn't work, you may end up having more money. I don't know.

909
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But you already are not not doing anything. And now you've been allowing all of this arguing to exist where now reboot do it differently. We're in here trying to uncover the dynamics that are going on here but $26,000

910
01:31:54.270 --> 01:32:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That would get you to two months of squishy buffer. After one year, we give you a little bit of breathing room.

911
01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And you can continue to build

912
01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're doing other monies. Okay. It's not like $400 is just look what Cindy is going to be holding money for coffee cigarettes. She's going to be holding money for gift. She's going to be holding money for

913
01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh this Photoshop InDesign supplies. It's not like Cindy's only spending 400 on all of the kids know there's money already for clothing. This is about Cindy Cindy's THIS THIS WOMAN WHO WANTS so sparkle thing that just enjoys

914
01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Being

915
01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants to go to. Oh.

916
01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask you something. Scott, do you feel proud of the fact that you've created a lifestyle that gives her a chance to do that.

917
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:02.880
Cynthia We: Well yeah i wish i always wish I could do more. I always wish she could do more.

918
01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:08.100
Cynthia We: I just in the mentality of been in the mentality. It's been so rough

919
01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:11.700
Cynthia We: Even when I'm working in and not saving enough that

920
01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:26.400
Cynthia We: And then when we're not working and stuff that I were just, I'm like, we should be down in the trenches, you should be sacrificing we should be probably and I wish it wasn't like that, but that's how I feel. It has been so

921
01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:27.930
Cynthia We: I'm

922
01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.200

Cynthia We: Yes, I would like to

925
01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know whether we really believe each other.

926
01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.950
Cynthia We: I totally believe what he's saying. Yeah.

927
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell him that you want some black and say, You know what, Scott. Let me see if I get this. You look right out of a mirror him. Here I am.

928
01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how to do that.

929
01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:00.930
Cynthia We: Yeah, so, um,

930
01:34:04.050 --> 01:34:06.180
Cynthia We: What I heard you say is that you

931
01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:17.850
Cynthia We: sort of feel proud that you've created this life for us, but I don't actually I don't believe that. I don't believe it, but I don't believe that you believe that your

932
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, deep breath.

933
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:20.640
Cynthia We: Proud, I don't

Cynthia We: That we have this house every have these things and the kids are comfortable and and we have all all this stuff. Like I feel like you've really really kicked ass and

936
01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:48.720
Cynthia We: provided all of this stuff for your family on your own. I have not contributed. Um, and

937
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:50.940
Cynthia We: I'm so proud of you.

938
01:34:54.330 --> 01:34:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You are you letting that in Scott

939
01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:08.250
Cynthia We: Yeah, a little bit i i'm whether it's right or wrong. I'm automatically thinking of things that have been said that haven't been along those lines.

940
01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.680
Cynthia We: Complaints about how we live complaints about. We don't have

941
01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:15.720
Cynthia We: That has happened.

942
01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, I know.

943
01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.290
Cynthia We: Many feel like crap, this time.

944
01:35:21.150 --> 01:35:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Good one, because I'm how the dynamics between you two right

945
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:32.670
Cynthia We: He often says that, oh, most women get to do this. Most women get to do that.

946
01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Cindy hold space for him. You can do it. You're doing great, you just shared something really

947
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:52.500
Cynthia We: Makes me feel crappy that I'm not getting what she really wants and she wants more. And Jen. Because yes, I understand. I'm asking you to get down in the trenches sometime, but

948
01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me let me, let me say something, it could be. And I want to slow down, because if we go this fast. There'll be nothing productive. It'll feel like what you guys are always doing so.

949
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back, look at each other. I've Cindy, I want you to say it concisely again what you're grateful for and we're just going to slow this down so it has an impact.

950
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And Scott, you're going to mirror and mirror it just remembering it. Let me see if I get this straight, you're grateful to me for making possible as home and and and this lifestyle and

951
01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.350
Cynthia We: I, I am

952
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:34.620
grateful that you

953
01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:36.600
Cynthia We: Have

954
01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:45.960
Cynthia We: Provided this home this House and that we can send our kids to private school and the kids all the stuff I'm

955
01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.490
Cynthia We: Proud of you. And I'm grateful for it.

956
01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Somewhere that back just so she knows you heard her not a different story line and you're

957
01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:04.830
Cynthia We: Grateful that that I've been able to provide to this house, the house and then we can we do that the kids get to do what they want to do and

958
01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That tuition.

959
01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:13.080
Cynthia We: And then the private school can can happen.

960
01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.770
Cynthia We: Great, and you're out.

961
01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There and I get that right.

962
01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.130
Is there more

963
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:27.720
Cynthia We: More

964
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:34.260
Cynthia We: I do

965
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.530
Cynthia We: Wish

966
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.350
Cynthia We: That you could see

967
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:44.430
Cynthia We: That how much you get enough

968
01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:49.260
Cynthia We: That you would feel proud of yourself.

969
01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.270
Cynthia We: Writing

970
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.090
One.

971
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.980
Cynthia We: Thing you wish that I could see

972
01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:03.810
How much

973
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:06.750
Cynthia We: Longer

974
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.090
Cynthia We: Wish I could feel my school you are really like I

975
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so you didn't quite do it. Scott, you look at, like she was trying to tell you something. And you scratched and you're like, we're out something's going on. It's hard to hear that well.

976
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I want you to feel that look right at him. I want you to

977
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:41.430
Cynthia We: Do to feel that proud of yourself and and

978
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:47.370
Cynthia We: I want you to see all you you've given us instead of seeing the negatives to see

979
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:49.770
Cynthia We: How much we have

980
01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.650
Cynthia We: And how successful you are

981
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:56.820
Cynthia We: Let me see.

982
01:38:58.110 --> 01:38:58.830
How proud you are

983
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:04.080
Cynthia We: What's your plan need to feel that, oh man, so

984
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're going to hold space for him, Cindy. So Scott

985
01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever is coming up right now, whatever's going on we're going to flip it. She's going to mirror you it's not a regular argument, kind of thing. So what's coming up for you and to share with her.

986
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on, just kind of thoughts and feelings, just in small chunks, because she's going to need to Maryland deal

987
01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:32.430
Cynthia We: Oh,

988
01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:36.660
Cynthia We: About that. Yeah. How do you feel about what I

989
01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait a minute, anything. It's the basics that are going on.

990
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:42.870
Yeah.

991
01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm some of the big ones. I mean, let's take this time and share with her one of your big concerns or whatever.

992
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to be just response to what you said.

993
01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:01.530
Cynthia We: Why do you believe

994
01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:11.730
Cynthia We: Like I said,

995
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:21.720
Cynthia We: It feels like something that you said in therapy what normally said

996
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That back

997
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.580
Cynthia We: I know we're gonna have to go that feels like something I would say in therapy, not something that I wouldn't want

998
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.650
Cynthia We: To get that thing.

999
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:34.110
Cynthia We: That doesn't mean it's not true.

1000
01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:36.960
Cynthia We: Well, I guess.

1001
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:40.350
Cynthia We: Is it nitpicky we say I want

1002
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.360
Cynthia We: To be nice.

1003
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:46.530
Cynthia We: If you realize that

1004
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.030
Cynthia We: For sure that

1005
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:53.760
gratefulness, I guess.

1006
01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.340
Cynthia We: I'm

1007
01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Not let me help you. Come here. We're going to what I call gossip. So you're not going to talk for a second.

1008
01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'd like you to do is this other structure which is I want you to do the I feel, I feel less than hurt worthless, whatever your truth as you plug that in. I feel

1009
01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Ashamed guilty, whatever it is you plug it not emotion word when I hear you say, well, other women have this and other people are doing, be specific on something you heard

1010
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, last week, last month, last year, whatever it is, it really represents this

1011
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This this disconnect that's happening, you have one in your head.

1012
01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.040
Cynthia We: Oh,

1013
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:41.550
Cynthia We: Generally, I'm

1014
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Benefits specific because you have one earlier.

1015
01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.670
Cynthia We: Yeah, that's, um,

1016
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz I don't know how you feel, either. I'd be curious to have that out loud and see

1017
01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to guess.

1018
01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:05.700
Cynthia We: When, when you expressed to me that you don't have what other women have or

1019
01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.560
Cynthia We: Um, or what you

1020
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:14.550
Cynthia We: Believe you should have in regards to

1021
01:42:18.210 --> 01:42:19.830
Cynthia We: Well, I mean,

1022
01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You flipped it around. So we've got the the because part, but we don't have as the front end. So between you and I. What's the emotion that you experience when you hear well I don't have the stuff that other women have well

1023
01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:36.360
Cynthia We: It's

1024
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:42.600
Cynthia We: It's it's frustration and a little bit of anger.

1025
01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:51.240
Cynthia We: But underneath it. It's. It makes me feel bad. It makes you feel like less of a provider.

1026
01:42:55.650 --> 01:43:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get more specific. You're almost there. If you're less of a provider, right, because right we got frustration and anger. That's how we protect the underbelly stuff that you're about to tell me what it is, if I

1027
01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling not like a provider and you are working really hard and sacrificing in your life. What's the emotion under their

1028
01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:23.520
Cynthia We: Sadness.

1029
01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. Now we've got the structure

1030
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to say this to her now. I feel sad.

1031
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When I hear you say that you you don't have the things that other women have

1032
01:43:42.090 --> 01:43:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now it's going to be your own thing, obviously, but just look at her. This is a hard thing to say.

1033
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:56.490
Cynthia We: Well, when you express that you don't have the other things that more things or things that you feel you deserve that you don't have it makes me feel sad.

1034
01:43:58.410 --> 01:43:58.740
On

1035
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it one more time at this to see if you can actually look at her. I've been noticing.

1036
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.340
Cynthia We: It also makes me feel

1037
01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.620
Cynthia We: Something I don't want to feel it makes me feel that

1038
01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:16.770
I don't

1039
01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:23.940
Cynthia We: Know it makes me feel about her and I don't like it. And I don't want it.

1040
01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:28.860
Cynthia We: You know, I feel something, some sometimes we say that it's selfish.

1041
01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but we thought to get those words out to understand because she may already have those about herself at times, right, because earlier. She was you were probably alluding to. Do you think I'm selfish when I spend my $400 it was already there. What can we talk about it.

1042
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:45.720
Cynthia We: Huh.

1043
01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1044
01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a name it. We've got to stay. These

1045
01:44:53.610 --> 01:45:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. Scott, because you're sacrificing right. That makes sense, that has real logic. Let's get there, but we're let's get through this one first. You're almost there. I feel

1046
01:45:08.190 --> 01:45:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: When we go with that one.

1047
01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if, if the interpretation is she's being selfish. Watch. Let's walk it back. Let's do the same structure. Again, Scott between you and I, we're going to work this out.

1048
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see her being we're not going to put it in question being selfish Varun interpreted it right it's that's what you're the meaning you see her being selfish. How do you feel

1049
01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know. The first one is going to be anger, but there's more under that

1050
01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:45.720
Cynthia We: I'm frustrated. I'm

1051
01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Bigger than frustrated

1052
01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:20.700
Cynthia We: Well, I don't know, because I, I don't want to feel she's selfish and turn into a big mess because then I feel at this little feeling like always, is my wife being selfish and that's a sad feeling to or and we're not uncommon ground with these things. So it's a I'm giving up i'm i'm

1053
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:23.430
Cynthia We: Helpless

1054
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting somewhere. Okay.

1055
01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.020
Cynthia We: Like it. Yeah.

1056
01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:31.650
Cynthia We: I don't know.

1057
01:46:33.150 --> 01:46:34.920
Cynthia We: Just throw my arms in the air and then

1058
01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's try this one. You and I are just going to gossip then we'll then we'll look her in the eye.

1059
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel helpless. When I see you saying things that I interpreted as a selfish.

1060
01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel helpless. When I see some things you do or say and

1061
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel helpless. That, I think, I think it really getting somewhere with that.

1062
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see how you do. If you actually look at her. It's bypassed the whole I shouldn't feel that way about my wife just bypass that one. Okay.

1063
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:21.780
Cynthia We: Yeah, well,

1064
01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:26.310
Cynthia We: When we get into this, or when you say these certain things.

1065
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:28.260
It's

1066
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:30.960
Cynthia We: Ultimately feel helpless.

1067
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.150
Cynthia We: I feel like there's no

1068
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:37.650
Cynthia We: I'm worried that there's no real solution. And I have to live with that.

1069
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I gotta live whatever's in front of me.

1070
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:45.210
Know,

1071
01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:49.920
Cynthia We: resigned to resign resigned my life.

1072
01:47:56.490 --> 01:48:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it this Scott I feel helpless. When I hear you say you don't have these things that other women have because I'm providing money, but it seems like you're spending it in ways I don't understand is that are we getting somewhere with that one.

1073
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:14.640
Cynthia We: Yeah.

1074
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we

1075
01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: go nice and quiet go inside really reflect on what I just did. But you need to make it your truth.

1076
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:27.780
Cynthia We: Well, what you just said was, um,

1077
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.150
Cynthia We: About understanding how she spends right

1078
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring true to that feel like there was some truth in that for you.

1079
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:42.390
Cynthia We: Well, yeah, it seems like a different thing, we're talking about. Or maybe not. Um,

1080
01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:51.840
Cynthia We: I don't know when you say that I think the spending habits. I don't understand when we're in a certain situation.

1081
01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that the behavior that is selfish.

1082
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:57.660
Cynthia We: Yeah.

1083
01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting somewhere. So go inside, close your eyes for just a second, make it your own.

1084
01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And the structure really helps. I gotta tell you, so try it on. Just, I know it feels artificial perhaps I feel helpless. When I see money being spent here it and I interpret it is selfish and you're complaining, you don't have enough, but I see you spending money and it looks selfish.

1085
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.800
feel helpless.

1086
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's a lot. Just try and make it nice and concise, but she's gonna have to

1087
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:50.550
Cynthia We: Understand when

1088
01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.020
You

1089
01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.440
Cynthia We: Wait, or

1090
01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:01.380
You

1091
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:07.980
Cynthia We: Have a hard time expressing how I just

1092
01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:10.470
Cynthia We: I feel like I'm

1093
01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:14.880
Cynthia We: I'm always on the side of the argument like I'm always on the side of

1094
01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.300
Cynthia We: The issue of

1095
01:50:20.130 --> 01:50:20.490
Cynthia We: I'm

1096
01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:21.930
Confused.

1097
01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, where the money.

1098
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:27.210
Cynthia We: Yeah, and I

1099
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:28.590
feel helpless.

1100
01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.690
Cynthia We: I feel there's a lot of

1101
01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.480
Cynthia We: Hurtful spending in there.

1102
01:50:36.450 --> 01:50:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh hurtful like she's trying to hurt you.

1103
01:50:38.970 --> 01:50:43.320
Cynthia We: Well, I think there's been revenge spending issues.

1104
01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.680
Cynthia We: Like revenge against revenge, but

1105
01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.660
Cynthia We: When she perceives me as controlling when she perceives me is

1106
01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:03.030
Cynthia We: badgering about everything she will go and do twice as much and it feels like rebellion.

1107
01:51:04.710 --> 01:51:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're almost there. We I think we can get there. I think we can get to that. So Scott. One more time. I know it's asking a lot. It may seem repetitive.

1108
01:51:13.170 --> 01:51:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But your wife hasn't contained and held gently and carefully what you're talking about. And I think it's important that you guys do that for each other.

1109
01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So depressed.

1110
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel, and you could list out a few of those emotion words because it's a complicated one, because I've got some here okay plus

1111
01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When I hear you do this or I see you do that nice and tight, nice and short so she can mirror back to you.

1112
01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, look at her, because this is this is where we really get to feel the truth. And what we're saying. And how hard it is that we are feeling it. When we look into each other's eyes. It's hard.

1113
01:51:56.190 --> 01:51:57.660
I feel helpless. When you do

1114
01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So hard. I know I told you.

1115
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.210
What

1116
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:15.690
Cynthia We: Was things. And when you spend money on things that are

1117
01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:21.690
Cynthia We: That I perceived as that.

1118
01:52:24.150 --> 01:52:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You're selfish.

1119
01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Or frivolous. What's the word

1120
01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:33.420
Cynthia We: Necessary. Okay.

1121
01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:35.760
Cynthia We: When we're going to

1122
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.030
Cynthia We: More necessary place or when we make commitments to each other.

1123
01:52:43.170 --> 01:52:46.020
Cynthia We: Or when we've talked about things and and

1124
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:50.640
Cynthia We: And agreed on things. It's very frustrating.

1125
01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.710
Cynthia We: And that is ultimately your health is feeling

1126
01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:05.730
Cynthia We: Because I can't say anything or doing the right because if I want to talk to you about it.

1127
01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright that was long

1128
01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is harder to mirror back long ones like that. So I can either

1129
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask to say it again, more concisely, or you and I can gossip Cindy and I can help you say

1130
01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.200
Cynthia We: The real feeling the base feeling helpless. I'm living in helplessness financial

1131
01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: When I see you spending on things that are unnecessary and they go against an agreement. I thought we had period when it so

1132
01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:46.740
Cynthia We: I feel completely

1133
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:56.040
Cynthia We: spending money on things that we in ways that we agreed not to and you're doing

1134
01:53:58.590 --> 01:53:59.070
When you spend

1135
01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:00.540
Money.

1136
01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay.

1137
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So frivolous. It has to do with, I don't want to deviate too far.

1138
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, is what I said. Getting it Scott did that get

1139
01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That example because then that got it. I feel completely helpless. When you spend money on things that I believe are unnecessary and that are in opposite of what I thought we agreed on.

1140
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that get it. Scott, yes. Okay then.

1141
01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep breath Sunday. You're doing, you're doing a beautiful thing holding this and listen to me and mirror doesn't sit there and

1142
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It just

1143
01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.230
Cynthia We: I know

1144
01:54:49.770 --> 01:54:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: He bought this girl.

1145
01:54:52.680 --> 01:55:05.160
Cynthia We: Huh, you feel helpless completely helpless completely helpless. When you see me spending money on things that you believe are unnecessary.

1146
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:20.580
Cynthia We: And that you believe go against any agreement we have for spending and what we started this conversation with was that you feel helpless. When I say I don't have things other women.

1147
01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:22.680
Yes. Did I get that.

1148
01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.070
Cynthia We: And I get that get that right. Yeah.

1149
01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there more. Is there more

1150
01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:32.760
Oh,

1151
01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there is. Then

1152
01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:35.610
Oh,

1153
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:39.360
Cynthia We: No, you got it.

1154
01:55:41.010 --> 01:55:41.310
Cynthia We: Okay.

1155
01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you believe that she understands

1156
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The degree of distress.

1157
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:55.110
Cynthia We: Know,

1158
01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That concept of complete helplessness, is that the part you don't think she really rocks.

1159
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:06.360
Cynthia We: Yeah, I don't think

1160
01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.790
Cynthia We: I don't think she grasp how sad it makes me

1161
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:17.880
Cynthia We: How stressful. The helplessness is

1162
01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. We're that accident.

1163
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:30.390
Cynthia We: You don't think I get how helpless. You feel and how stressed out. It makes you. Did I get that right.

1164
01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:33.960
Cynthia We: How

1165
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:38.010
Cynthia We: How that level of helplessness.

1166
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:43.740
Cynthia We: How stressful. That makes my life.

1167
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:54.990
Cynthia We: You don't feel that I understand how that level of helplessness. How stressful that make sure like I get that, no.

1168
01:56:59.700 --> 01:56:59.970
No.

1169
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.060
Cynthia We: Yes, it's more

1170
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.440
Cynthia We: What I'm going to kill him in a second. Can I just pause and think about that real quick.

1171
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:29.340
Cynthia We: Shower now.

1172
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes.

1173
01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:33.180
Cynthia We: And we have to save a minute.

1174
01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:36.510
Cynthia We: I don't want

1175
01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:38.640
Cynthia We: Well then.

1176
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys

1177
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:42.270
Know,

1178
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.950
Cynthia We: Which means he doesn't want to go to India.

1179
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a couple of things are happening. We're way, way, way, way over, I'm and

1180
01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm liking what you guys are doing. I'm liking that you guys are talking, honestly, you're getting to those like

1181
01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Words like I see you a selfish. Well, maybe I am selfish isn't really okay to be selfish and what's the degree of selfishness and really having a quality of life, like where is that line. This is good stuff.

1182
01:58:20.610 --> 01:58:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Think about it. Because what you're risking, right now, Scott is that that Cindy shame blows up.

1183
01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Righteousness and indignation could be here and it could just be just this huge thing, but I'm not seeing you do that right now, Cindy. I'm seeing you sit there and I hope, what's going through your head is

1184
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You are a gift. The ability to be able to enjoy pretty shiny things and enjoy it as a gift, your husband. Can't do that right now, but he is sacrificing a lot

1185
01:58:54.990 --> 01:59:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys can you actually have the space in there to be able to really, really have a beautiful moment and I, you're so close. Okay, there can't be self-reproach

1186
01:59:07.230 --> 01:59:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are just, you have a different need a different capability, a different just a different way of meeting any minute. In the day or, you know, your mind goes over here. It's not bad either one of you are bad when you shake up all all of this stuff.

1187
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to come down to, how did we negotiate this together. Did we do it with loving kindness. Did I appreciate what's unique about you.

1188
01:59:32.850 --> 01:59:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How did we do this as a family, am I proud of what we did, am I proud of my part. Did I hold on to myself, and you really hold the space for another

1189
01:59:42.810 --> 01:59:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you do this, you know, I think you're very close to being able to to get somewhere really meaningful and start to get into whether it's behavior requests or something like that.

1190
01:59:55.980 --> 02:00:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But for example, Sydney you held some big stuff for him today. What are you gonna do with this. What are you gonna do with it.

1191
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.640
Cynthia We: Um, well.

1192
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I didn't flip it right. I didn't, I didn't get a chance for him to hold what's going on for you.

1193
02:00:15.810 --> 02:00:19.770
Cynthia We: I'm not gonna say shitty things. I don't mean anymore when I'm

1194
02:00:21.090 --> 02:00:22.050
Cynthia We: Feeling defensive

1195
02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:39.180
Cynthia We: Which I think is what of this conversation started off as shit that I've said in response to you, trying to control what I said or try it not believing what I spend money is important and I get defensive

1196
02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:42.900
Cynthia We: And I say things I say whatever I can.

1197
02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:56.880
Cynthia We: Make it go away. Right. But to understand that you feel those things like really deeply record. It really hurts you is don't feel that I don't care how many fucking shoes. I have

1198
02:00:57.990 --> 02:01:01.320
Cynthia We: It doesn't matter to me and you know that about me. I think

1199
02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:06.180
Cynthia We: So I thought you did.

1200
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. Well, I wish I was there because I think what I would be asking you guys to be doing is is adding a piece. And I don't know how much, how much just

1201
02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just basic contact you guys have. Is there any way that you guys could just hold each other's hands right now. Would you be willing to do that.

1202
02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And look at each other.

1203
02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And sit with it nice and quiet. So I'll do some talking. So just look at each other. It's hard because intimacy their stuff. We're going to me get each other.

1204
02:01:56.730 --> 02:01:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with your strength.

1205
02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your truth. Each of you with your own I spoke my truth. I know who I am. I know how I feel.

1206
02:02:10.410 --> 02:02:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not contingent on what someone else was I know who I am. Be with that. This is my troops. I made meaning out of something I overreact I under-reacting I

1207
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever the truth. It happened okay okay and

1208
02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sitting here in each other's lives caring enough to listen and to not judge

1209
02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's big. It's the judgment.

1210
02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That ultimately we're going to be abandoned that eventually. It's just, I'm not going to be good enough.

1211
02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Each of you are okay.

1212
02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, to share your truth.

1213
02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when we were vindictive

1214
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I was over, controlling. Well, I was vindictive I retaliated well I was passive aggressive. So what

1215
02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still lovable be with that.

1216
02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Different I'm special I'm unique I'm good enough.

1217
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm different. I'm special and unique and you guys have that to share

1218
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:57.030
Cynthia We: True. I am here. You're playing video games in the background. Yeah yeah and and it's making me mad with your voting all this, it totally

1219
02:03:58.650 --> 02:03:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1220
02:04:00.150 --> 02:04:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, listen. Um, but it's meaningful why it has meaning, you know, so there's other there's other competing priorities happening, I get it, I get it. So what do you guys want to do next. I think you guys accomplished a lot of

1221
02:04:15.210 --> 02:04:15.810
Cynthia We: Exhausted.

1222
02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it does. It takes my gosh, and you work so hard at that feeling stuff, man. You worked hard at it didn't work hard.

1223
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.210
Cynthia We: Good.

1224
02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's so much easier for us to just go as I'm angry, but it doesn't get to the heart of really why we're getting angry why we're using that anger to protect what's really going on our worst nightmare. I'm

1225
02:04:40.410 --> 02:04:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what I do to try and throw solution at this I cancel that I can't, I can't make this woman at the end. I can't do it. I can't do it. I mean, right. And there's this next stuff going on for you, Cindy. And I think we can get somewhere. I do.

1226
02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to see you again. But you guys decide. Let me know.

1227
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if my little list is going to be useful for you or you feel like you've already got your list worked out.

1228
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:11.580
Cynthia We: Are you going to send us a copy of that. Yeah, that'd be great. It would be very strong pair.

1229
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:18.120
