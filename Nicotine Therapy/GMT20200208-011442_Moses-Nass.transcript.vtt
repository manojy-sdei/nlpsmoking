00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.110
Moses Nasser: Okay, let me ask you this question. Do you ever hear voices that aren't there.

331
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.440
All the time.

332
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.370
Moses Nasser: Like an audible voice I

333
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:26.610
Hear

334
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:36.450
David Horn: I hear a female voice saying winning 24 seven i mean it's it's weird, like I out here for a while they'll stop.

335
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.770
David Horn: Like

336
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:46.950
David Horn: It's weird. I've heard. I've heard of woman's voice a lot throughout my life call my name and nobody either or nobody say my name or anything.

337
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.410
Moses Nasser: It doesn't sound familiar. It's like somebody that you know

338
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:54.510
David Horn: Yeah.

339
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.250
Moses Nasser: Who is it

340
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:05.460
David Horn: I want to say it's one moment, sometimes. But then again, it sounds like an ex girlfriend that I had grown up.

341
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.390
Moses Nasser: And does she ever tell you to do things.

342
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:12.600
David Horn: No.

343
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.080
Moses Nasser: Does she ever tell you anything or is it just saying your name.

344
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.050
David Horn: She says, My name.

345
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.320
Moses Nasser: Is it happening right now.

346
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.450
Moses Nasser: Do you ever feel like, are there any other voices, like you're here.

347
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.680
David Horn: No, not really.

348
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.890
Moses Nasser: Do you ever feel like people are watching you or people are after you

349
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.550
David Horn: 24 seven every day.

350
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.140
Moses Nasser: Tell me about it.

351
00:24:53.310 --> 00:25:02.760
David Horn: There used to be nights that I will go out recycle live down there underneath the bridge and just feel like they're people following me.

352
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.510
David Horn: hiding in the bushes and following me and watching what I do.

353
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.760
David Horn: I'll have the same cars pass by me or just weird.

354
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.140
Moses Nasser: I must have been scary but

355
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.970
David Horn: The, the thing, the thing with the people following me like I actually hear something or hear something behind me walking

356
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.840
David Horn: And then when I turn around with fasting, what will be there.

357
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.710
David Horn: Like you pits is not even human it's all, it's kind of spirit or something.

358
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.000
And

359
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.130
Moses Nasser: I see.

360
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.520
Moses Nasser: That must be really hard.

361
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.370
Moses Nasser: And the art to do with it.

362
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.020
David Horn: Trips me out a lot.

363
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.790
David Horn: I told her friends I

364
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.320
David Horn: Told the

365
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:13.920
David Horn: Doctor anyone this, but when I was little GROWN UP IN MY MOM'S HOME. I'll have my own room in there in the dark and hear, hear things

366
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.140
David Horn: See some some dark shadow in the corner sitting there lingering watching

367
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:26.070
David Horn: And they told me that I told him that I could have closed doors on my doors because I'll hear something inside the closet tapping on my door.

368
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.560
David Horn: Knocking on it, you know.

369
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:29.820
Wow.

370
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.960
Moses Nasser: Well,

371
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.320
Moses Nasser: Has anyone ever giving you medicine to try to help with that stuff.

372
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:54.990
Moses Nasser: Know,

373
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.380
David Horn: Like I said, I've been told anyone that

374
00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.760
David Horn: Yeah, you

375
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.440
David Horn: Know, but

376
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:09.450
Moses Nasser: Well, thank you for telling me that. Thank you for sharing it, because I know that must be really, really hard to share that with somebody you know cuz

377
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:18.000
Moses Nasser: You're probably like when I'm wondering whether someone going to think about me or something like that. So it takes a lot of courage to do that.

378
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.210
Moses Nasser: So thank you for sharing it. Okay.

379
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.810
David Horn: You're welcome. Thank you.

380
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:35.430
Moses Nasser: Of course, man. I'm just, I just wanna yeah I mean my heart goes out to you and I know that you're suffering a lot with this. I, I would love to be able to help you, you know,

381
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:49.590
Moses Nasser: Well, yeah, there's this medicine, um, there's this medicine. It's called Seroquel and what it does is it just like calms down your brain a little bit

382
00:27:49.980 --> 00:28:00.450
Moses Nasser: So that sometimes it can calm down the voices can stop and maybe stop feeling like people are after you, you know. And the other thing is a side effect is that it makes you, it helps you sleep.

383
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.070
Moses Nasser: And that might be

384
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.400
Moses Nasser: Good for you. It seems like you haven't slept since you were a kid.

385
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.860
Moses Nasser: I feel like you've been awake.

386
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.750
Moses Nasser: Feeling like

387
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.010
Moses Nasser: awake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right.

388
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.550
Moses Nasser: All right. Are you open to trying something like that.

389
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.620
Moses Nasser: Trying like some medicine.

390
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.720
David Horn: I just, I was honestly going to talk to my case with her about that, honestly, because

391
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.670
David Horn: Really good. Yeah.

392
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.990
David Horn: Calm down the line, because my mind hurts.

393
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.670
Moses Nasser: Your mind. Yeah, I don't blame you bring

394
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.650
Moses Nasser: Okay.

395
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.760
Moses Nasser: Well,

396
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.940
Moses Nasser: I think that this is kind of like a I think this was perfect timing for all of us, and

397
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.960
Moses Nasser: I think that that medicine might really help you a lot if we, if we think we should try it.

398
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:43.620
Moses Nasser: Yeah, I

399
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.630
Moses Nasser: Think we should try it.

400
00:29:49.350 --> 00:30:04.410
Moses Nasser: Let's try it out. And then, and then, you know, I want to make sure that it's working for you and I want to see if you know I want to make sure you're not having any side effects and I want to make sure it's helping you. So I want to keep close close contact with you, you know,

401
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.910
Moses Nasser: So it's not one keep checking on you, until the medicine is working.

402
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.480
Moses Nasser: Okay.

403
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.180
Moses Nasser: So, um,

404
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.740
Moses Nasser: So let's start with

405
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.370
Moses Nasser: Let's start with 100 milligrams and night.

406
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.650
Moses Nasser: Let's do that for the next three, four days.

407
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:53.010
Moses Nasser: And then I'll see you again on today's Friday. So, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So let's see how you sleep tonight Saturday night Sunday night, and then I'll see you again on Monday.

408
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.990
Moses Nasser: And

409
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.840
Moses Nasser: So on Monday. I want to see you by yourself. Michael quick, I'm not gonna see you in group.

410
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.850
Moses Nasser: Good. So I'll see you at

411
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.400
Moses Nasser: Want to see you at one o'clock.

412
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.220
David Horn: Do we just accept

413
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.560
David Horn: The call the same way.

414
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:41.670
Moses Nasser: Yeah, but it's, uh, yeah, actually, it will be the same way. So go to the bright heart health, the homepage and law and clock check in over there.

415
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:48.030
Moses Nasser: And then once you check in, you go over to my zoom room, and I'm going to tell them I'm having a one on one with him at one o'clock.

416
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.510
Moses Nasser: So is he out of his Suboxone

417
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.580
David Horn: Yes, and if you call it in all the pick it up for him.

418
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.330
Moses Nasser: Okay, let me make sure that I have his arm.

419
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.220
Moses Nasser: The correct pharmacy computer. Okay.

420
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.040
David Horn: Yeah, they confirmed it earlier, you should have Walgreens it on

421
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.950
Moses Nasser: McHenry 1100 or something. I can

422
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:44.100
Moses Nasser: Say I have that. So I'm going to send him in. So I don't know about the cravings are really high school a 10 out of 10

423
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.790
Moses Nasser: I don't like to change me he's

424
00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:55.800
David Horn: He's acting a lot better than he was. All right, hold on, hold on, wait a month on the Dr.

425
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:04.650
David Horn: Greene free guided meditation. I'm sorry I'm not doing a lot better than you did last week when we send it to the Suboxone

426
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.620
David Horn: So I know he's still struggling, but he is really doing well. I think he's probably fighting it.

427
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:17.880
David Horn: Emotionally, more than anything else. And there's not a whole lot to do here. So we are trying to find some type of other activities to

428
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:25.560
David Horn: You know, keep them occupied. So I'm working pretty closely with them. He comes in every day I check in with them all day long.

429
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:38.250
David Horn: And so we're working on that. The best we can and encouraging him to go out and mental health assessment. Some continue therapy, whatever you all can, you know, consider and I have been

430
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:52.140
David Horn: Trying to bring up the idea of rehab or going to some kind of treatment program but you know that's it's going to have to be up to him, you know, of course I want it, but he has to want it to.

431
00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:01.980
Moses Nasser: Yeah, well, this is definitely you know the bright heart health is a rehab program. I mean, it's not inpatient obviously so it's it's limited.

432
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.720
Moses Nasser: You know something in patient or a residential program would be great.

433
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:12.420
Moses Nasser: You know, I think residential program would be great, you know, if he could do that but you know I can do what I can for him.

434
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:24.510
Moses Nasser: Trust him up. So besides the circle. I just don't know if I should increases Suboxone right now. Or if we can

435
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.640
Moses Nasser: Kind of see how he how he does with the circle on board first.

436
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.260
Moses Nasser: You know,

437
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:39.780
Moses Nasser: What do you think, do you think we should increase your Suboxone because it's already a good dose, you know, 60 milligrams is not a low dose.

438
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.680
Moses Nasser: But you are using a lot of the no

439
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.100
David Horn: No, I don't think we should increase it yet.

440
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.890
David Horn: Circle works too.

441
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.330
Moses Nasser: Okay.

442
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.220
Moses Nasser: That's what I find right now as you're sleeping.

443
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.740
Moses Nasser: That's, that's what we'll do, then that's

444
00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:05.940
Moses Nasser: That's what we'll do. So we're sorry Seroquel. I'm going to give you Suboxone. I'm going to give you enough for today two pills today.

445
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:17.700
Moses Nasser: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, that's for. So I'll give you 10 pills and then I'll see you on Monday. And then when I see you on Monday. I'll give you another refill for the Suboxone because we do that every week. The Suboxone

446
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.390
Moses Nasser: Okay, okay.

447
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:35.460
Moses Nasser: And then we're going to see how you've been sleeping and and how things are going and see if we need to make an adjustment to the Seroquel maybe we can we can always go up or down on the Seroquel. So we have a lot of room to play.

448
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:50.580
Moses Nasser: Now, I do have to tell you that there is a possible side effects. Couple of side effects with the circle that I have to let you know about them before I give you the medicine. Okay, so one of the side effects, is that it can cause weight gain.

449
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.460
David Horn: Yeah.

450
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:06.720
Moses Nasser: The other side effect is that it can cause like some people get like muscle movements, you know, and the move their mouth like this, you know, and so if that happens, then we would just definitely stop the medicine.

451
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:23.160
Moses Nasser: Okay, I'm given your situation. I think that if we look at the risk or the side effects of taking the medicine versus the benefit how you're going to feel if you take it. I think the benefits outweigh the risks.

452
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:24.300
David Horn: Yeah.

453
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.520
Moses Nasser: But you're the one that has to make that decision.

454
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.020
Moses Nasser: You agree. You agree with that. Yeah.

455
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.280
Moses Nasser: Yeah, so you want to start it. You want to start the Seroquel then

456
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:49.470
Moses Nasser: Okay, I'll go ahead and send those two medicines to the pharmacy and I'll see you guys on on Monday at one o'clock. Let me send her a message to add add him to the schedule right now.

457
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.320
Moses Nasser: David horn.

458
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.410
Moses Nasser: ONE ON ONE WITH ME 1pm

459
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.880
Moses Nasser: Monday patient is aware

460
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:18.000
Moses Nasser: Okay, you guys have any final questions for me. Oh, one more thing. This Suboxone you can't combine it with, you know, if you add heroin to it or Xanax or alcohol or anything. You know, you can overdose and die.

461
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.680
Moses Nasser: Okay, okay.

462
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.650
Moses Nasser: All right, you guys have any other questions for me.

463
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:35.670
David Horn: Now I'll just make sure that these here at one o'clock, and I'll get the medications form and just let us know. We need to do and will support that.

464
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.520
Moses Nasser: Sounds good. Okay.

465
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.400
Moses Nasser: You have your wife. Do you have a Bible.

466
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:43.770
David Horn: No.

467
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:45.720
Find one

468
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.560
David Horn: Drink and get him on the Salvation Army. So we've

469
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.430
David Horn: Got Bible that

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.840
David Horn: No prizes. So

471
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:59.130
Moses Nasser: Let's crack open the Psalms, read the Psalms. They're very comforting and if you get real brave. You can crack open Joshua

472
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.050
Moses Nasser: Joshua goes out and just all the peoples man Joshua's crazy has conquered

473
