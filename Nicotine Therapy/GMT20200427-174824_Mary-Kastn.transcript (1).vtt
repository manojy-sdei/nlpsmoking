14
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.870
AnnMarie Terranova: I'm doing it from home, which makes it at least a little better. So

15
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.590
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so you don't have all the non verbal stuff going on.

16
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.310
AnnMarie Terranova: It's

20
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.980
AnnMarie Terranova: It's too long of a story, but I actually, the people that are

21
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.070
AnnMarie Terranova: Technically on the company that we started the investors.

22
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.180
AnnMarie Terranova: I've never actually physically worked with them, just the weirdest part of it all. It was just

23
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.870
The

24
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.060
AnnMarie Terranova: Someone who's my age, actually, and

25
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.040
AnnMarie Terranova: Greatest just get no silver spoon in his mouth.

26
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.180
AnnMarie Terranova: Them had

27
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.740
AnnMarie Terranova: Never been told, No one so willing to kind of lost the battle of

28
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.810
AnnMarie Terranova: Giving my job to his best friend's wife at a much higher paying salary.

29
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.140
AnnMarie Terranova: Than that mine is

30
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.530
AnnMarie Terranova: On the bus. Yeah. So, so now

31
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.720
AnnMarie Terranova: So yeah, it was

32
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.700
AnnMarie Terranova: It was just non stop.

33
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.820
AnnMarie Terranova: It was awful but

34
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.640
AnnMarie Terranova: Let's see, it's not that

35
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.650
AnnMarie Terranova: I am the only employee that has to

36
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.250
AnnMarie Terranova: We received an SBA loan.

37
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.630
AnnMarie Terranova: For the company which honestly makes me

38
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:17.460
AnnMarie Terranova: A little unhappy only because we were still working and turning a profit. And so those SBA, most of the small businesses. I think ship on to somebody else, but

39
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:27.060
AnnMarie Terranova: We were told to keep our payroll up. And so my boss that a mixture. You know, you turn in your own time, because I know you burn you.

40
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.970
AnnMarie Terranova: Sorry there.

41
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.740
Mary Kastner: That's okay.

42
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.820
Okay.

43
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.930
AnnMarie Terranova: Do we really push it and then take to get invoices in and

44
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:51.030
AnnMarie Terranova: We have insurance office. So stuff like that going on now. So I said, Okay, you know, if they told us to keep our payroll up and I said, okay, he won't return my over time. You can save. Yeah, so

45
00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:12.810
AnnMarie Terranova: I'm the only employee at it's like 30 and they all have, I mean 20 plus to like 35 hours of overtime and I think I had like 12 when mine was feeling was like questions or even. I mean, I had to have an account for every minute that those are time

46
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.510
AnnMarie Terranova: We're done.

47
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.310
AnnMarie Terranova: So,

48
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.660
AnnMarie Terranova: It's just, I'm for some reason the exception of with him. I don't know why.

49
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.400
Mary Kastner: So I've started kind of

50
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:44.160
AnnMarie Terranova: brushing up on my resume and kind of looking around, but don't want to post it publicly because if they work to see that if those investors that's ownership or see that the media. We look to replace so

51
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.880
AnnMarie Terranova: So that's I think I'm pretty

52
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.420
AnnMarie Terranova: This isn't the

53
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.270
AnnMarie Terranova: Adventure that we all kind of thought that we were getting into when when it started.

54
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.280
AnnMarie Terranova: And

55
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.310
AnnMarie Terranova: I'm

56
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.130
AnnMarie Terranova: Definitely realizing that and I made shorter

57
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.390
AnnMarie Terranova: This you know I should be looking for longevity.

58
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.200
AnnMarie Terranova: Some company that wants to invest as much money as it within them and

59
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:36.030
AnnMarie Terranova: And I'm fortunate enough to have a family that has allowed me to, you know, come back and stay with them, you know, once my husband and I split up because cyclically

60
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.060
AnnMarie Terranova: Before as the saloon right now to be on

AnnMarie Terranova: I would get a call, but

68
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.600
Mary Kastner: Let me see what happened to that and I thought I had requested that, but maybe I

69
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.370
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so

70
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.090

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.700

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.350
AnnMarie Terranova: Up just

221
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.940
AnnMarie Terranova: 252 grams a day right now.

222
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.600
AnnMarie Terranova: And I tried to make

223
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.030
Mary Kastner: You take our

224
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:45.780
AnnMarie Terranova: Total of 10

225
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.520
You're taking

226
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.580
Mary Kastner: Okay, I gotta change this.

227
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.270
Mary Kastner: It's the tablet.

228
00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.390
Know why I have that in there differently. Okay.

229
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.440
Mary Kastner: Cabot okay

230
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.900
Mary Kastner: It's two milligram

231
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.950
Mary Kastner: You take it five times a day.

232
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.220
AnnMarie Terranova: Yeah, so to challenge our friends.

233
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:45.150
Mary Kastner: Okay, for some reason, we had an eight milligram in here and then you took two tabs of the of the two milligrams

234
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.820
AnnMarie Terranova: That would work to

235
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.500
AnnMarie Terranova: What that makes it easier on sleep so I just not matter to me which way it's like

236
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.850
Mary Kastner: Okay, two tabs.

237
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.880
Mary Kastner: In addition to an eight.

238
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.160
Mary Kastner: That doesn't make sense in your you're taking me

239
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.160
Mary Kastner: Is it playing buprenorphine or is it been

240
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.600
Mary Kastner: buprenorphine no locks on

241
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.550
Mary Kastner: His plane. Women are

242
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:30.090
Mary Kastner: Okay, that's, that's what I'm getting confused at okay so

243
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.860
Mary Kastner: It's a tablet. I've had a film in here.

244
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.990
Mary Kastner: And what time of day are you taking them.

245
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.800
AnnMarie Terranova: I honestly I tried to space them out. Usually it's like one and a half in the morning and then

246
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:59.790
AnnMarie Terranova: Probably to another late afternoon and then before right before bed one

247
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.440
Mary Kastner: Okay, so do you prefer getting the two milligrams in

248
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.590
AnnMarie Terranova: Instead of a nice enough

249
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.920
To

250
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:15.810
AnnMarie Terranova: Well, it doesn't matter. It honestly doesn't. So whichever way is easiest or whatever ways

251
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.080
Mary Kastner: That it won't be able to space them out.

252
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.300
AnnMarie Terranova: That's true.

253
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:30.450
AnnMarie Terranova: It doesn't matter. I can split it into it. It honestly whatever is

254
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.890
AnnMarie Terranova: Easier. I mean, I guess it's kind of nice to see some now.

255
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.770
Mary Kastner: It is nice to space them out.

256
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.490
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Okay, then I'm not gonna do this.

257
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.200
Mary Kastner: So it's a

258
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:56.280
Mary Kastner: milligram and you're taking five of them a day and I'm just gonna say five over the course of the day.

259
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.690
Yes.

260
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.150
AnnMarie Terranova: Let you

261
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.500
Where you want

262
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.220
Mary Kastner: No, no locks on just a milligram

263
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.270
Yeah.

264
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.980
Mary Kastner: One sibling Glee.

265
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.590
Mary Kastner: Five times a day.

266
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.320
Mary Kastner: Okay, so

267
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.770
Mary Kastner: I need to give you quite a few of them in 150 to make a month.

268
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.930
AnnMarie Terranova: I know that's the only like

269
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.820
AnnMarie Terranova: I guess downside to that is

270
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.540
AnnMarie Terranova: You know, that's a, it's a lot to

271
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.460
AnnMarie Terranova: Try and make sure I'm on the right, count, stuff like that.

272
00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.530
AnnMarie Terranova: So,

273
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.050
Mary Kastner: Okay, how do you count to make sure you don't take too many

274
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.720
AnnMarie Terranova: I'm usually pretty on that I should use the

275
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.700
AnnMarie Terranova: Weekly dispenser thing that I have. That's like every single day.

276
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.290
AnnMarie Terranova: So,

277
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.820
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Cuz that would be

278
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.570
AnnMarie Terranova: Just to get too many yet normally I'm under which is good because I

279
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:39.090
AnnMarie Terranova: I I freaked out about that, like being out at the last minute, but no, I'm gonna, I have one of those weekly

280
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.890
AnnMarie Terranova: Or daily ones. So I'm going to use that, but I'm

281
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.880
AnnMarie Terranova: Right on count. Now, so that's good, that's good.

282
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.480
Mary Kastner: Okey dokey. It's in for you.

284
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.890

Galaxy A50: I actually had a mask on, because I was moving it rocks and it's really easily inhalable

322
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.030
Mary Kastner: Oh, uh huh, uh huh.

323
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.410
Mary Kastner: So, how you doing,

324
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:52.440
Galaxy A50: My well not very well to be honest but okay with the weather being so hot. I'm getting a lot more like stir crazy than before.

325
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.340
Mary Kastner: You're not seeing clients. Yet are you

326
00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:05.670
Galaxy A50: Know, not really, but I do spend time here because there's air conditioning and, like, for example, this. Can you see my display.

327
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.990
Mary Kastner: Oh, no.

328
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.160
Galaxy A50: Today, yeah, I'm gonna put a little hooks and him.

329
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:29.250
Galaxy A50: Like hang little things to refute it's just at home. There's too many people, although we do get along. It's too hot and there's too many people and I you can't, it's just the same people driving me crazy. I don't know how freakin Congress to do it.

330
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:30.720
Galaxy A50: But

331
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:36.150
Galaxy A50: My ex husband doubt that he sees that the end is near.

332
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.190
Galaxy A50: He is doing everything possible to screw with me.

333
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.540
Galaxy A50: So he sent Hayden to the dumb, for example.

334
00:25:50.640 --> 00:26:03.420
Galaxy A50: In the middle of a pandemic, because the dump is the best place for a child to be and he won't let him. So there's in these things are just simply done to annoy me. There's no other reason behind it.

335
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:11.910
Galaxy A50: There's so there's school at home now. Actually, let me sit down. So school at home.

336
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:24.780
Galaxy A50: A child gets his assignment for the week. And he has to communicate with all his teachers at least once, so he could say, Hey, I'm doing okay. It could be in text. It could be an

337
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:30.780
Galaxy A50: Email, just because I was the first one to remind my kid to do this. He won't let him do it.

338
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.090
Galaxy A50: In a.so weird that he actually started telling him over the phone like as I'm talking to my son.

339
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:44.940
Galaxy A50: He interrupts and basically tells my son. Oh, you don't. You don't have to do it. Can you believe this.

340
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:54.990
Galaxy A50: But then, last Saturday. Two days ago. He's old Hayden doesn't want to talk to you. And he's almost 12 I can't make him, so I was like

341
00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:03.150
Galaxy A50: You can't you're an adult, you can handle an almost 12 year old. What are the, what are the chances. You're the better, more responsible parent

342
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:14.670
Galaxy A50: Right. Isn't that ridiculous. So he was just because my kids said where's dinner. Basically, and dinner wasn't ready until right the time that I was supposed to call which

343
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:30.900
Galaxy A50: The father should have notified me and rescheduled and there's nothing I can do. Because there's no courts and nobody's going to care because it sounds like such a piddly us problem right so then my son was like, well, of course, I'm going to eat well

344
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:50.430
Galaxy A50: So he just texted me. I'll talk to you later, not really thinking well his dad just not gonna let him talk to me later. Just because to be a dick. So it took an hour and an involvement of the p deputy sheriff, just to get time from six o'clock, my time to eight o'clock, my time.

345
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.600
Galaxy A50: Isn't that exhausting.

346
00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.890
Mary Kastner: Is exhausting.

347
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:18.030
Galaxy A50: And then the last communication, he had with me the Father. He's like, You know what, I'm done talking about it. I'm right. You're wrong. Deal with it. That's his whole life is trying to prove something to me. I don't know if he doesn't understand that. I don't care about him.

348
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:30.270
Galaxy A50: I want I don't know why. So at that point, I was like, Oh, is this a pissing contest. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. Yes, Marvin. You're right. You're always right.

349
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.330
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that's the only way you can deal with them.

350
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:45.600
Mary Kastner: It seems like in not get into it, you know, just don't avoid the conflict and just try to talk to your son.

351
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:56.700
Galaxy A50: Well, that's the thing that it's almost impossible because when you when you give him a chance to win if anything it it's like

352
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:18.840
Galaxy A50: When I shut him down, he turns extremely nasty when I give into him. He feels very like very much like, you know, I, I'm the man and then still, it makes them want to do more stuff because he's you know he's on top of the world. I cannot get this guy to I cannot get rid of.

353
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.770
Mary Kastner: And it's so early.

354
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.310
Mary Kastner: You're not gonna be able to when you're

355
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.860
Mary Kastner: Old, are you sleeping at night.

356
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.440
Mary Kastner: With a dress.

357
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:41.400
Galaxy A50: Yeah I am, I am, my sleep is fine. There was only like one night that I couldn't sleep right now was just because

358
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:52.110
Galaxy A50: We have wild animals and they kept turning like by running in they kept turning our signals on and off. It was just weird.

359
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.050
Mary Kastner: So woody Woody. Oh, you mean your, your electricity or

360
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:10.530
Galaxy A50: Yeah, and the little like if everything goes like like interrogation lifestyle and then you hear like slick something starts recording and she's like, and then you just like, Okay, what is it,

361
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:18.120
Galaxy A50: And then of course, you look at you look out just to make sure. And you see a huge Coyote And then I'm like, oh,

362
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.040
Mary Kastner: No, not pretty. If you got a dog or cat. Yeah.

363
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:34.140
Galaxy A50: That's the thing. I think they smell the dog and the cat. But the owners take them in at night, but the dog and the cat Yogi's keep looking.

364
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:35.700
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

365
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.760
Mary Kastner: Marion, yeah. Make sure they're in. Yeah.

366
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.420
Mary Kastner: Well how's your mood today. As far as his

367
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:48.480
Galaxy A50: Depression today is good Saturday was really bad. Oh, I don't suffer from depression.

368
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.720
Mary Kastner: I'm not depressed. What, okay. How about anxiety.

369
00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:03.360
Galaxy A50: Anxiety today's pretty good actually. Yesterday was, of course, like I was playing out all the things that I could say in my head to my ex husband.

370
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:11.820
Galaxy A50: But i i can't i. It's like I have to get it out of my system right so then I just

371
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.210
Mary Kastner: Kind of

372
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:25.620
Galaxy A50: Play it out in my head to get that as like the scenario. But then as much as it helps me get it out of my system, it still rises like my you know insights form of the course. So, yesterday was pretty shitty

373
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:37.710
Galaxy A50: And then I don't know what happened but the roommates that I have. They had a very strange fight at the end of the night and they never fight and it just kind of, I felt really like I didn't belong there.

374
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.570
Galaxy A50: So the song and the better. We're supposed to

375
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:56.490
Galaxy A50: We're supposed to get our courts are supposed to open the 26 and we're supposed to get the first of available hearings, just because everything shut down right before it was our turn.

376
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.690
Galaxy A50: But it just never ends.

377
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.640
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

378
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.930
Galaxy A50: Because now the financial has to go through that.

379
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.860
The next night.

380
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.460
Galaxy A50: It's just one damn thing after another.

381
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.160
Mary Kastner: So do you have

382
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:24.270
Mary Kastner: obsessive thinking about all this that you, you know, thoughts, you just can't get out of your head that are

383
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.000
Mary Kastner: You know, sort of on treating you know your thoughts.

384
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:42.450
Galaxy A50: I, the thing that I keep thinking about that. It is kind of that I am like mulling over and over in my head is the time that I'm wasting building a teenager, because my kid is not

385
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:57.150
Galaxy A50: As much as he's not a bad kid at all. He's just starting that company confrontational, whatever. And like on Saturday. I really like we focused on being a gentleman.

386
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.790
Galaxy A50: But it's so hard, because I'm wasting precious time and I'm not

387
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:08.130
Galaxy A50: The same kind of little citizen that I would have had he been with me the whole time.

388
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:21.300
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that's definitely situationally stressful with your living situation with your interactions with your ex, and definitely those those thoughts.

389
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.520
Galaxy A50: Yeah, I think the

390
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.630
Mary Kastner: Positive thing you can do is just one day at a time, you know,

391
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:31.080
Mary Kastner: Yeah, any set any side effects from the Latina

392
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:41.640
Galaxy A50: Know, but something else happened. You remember how I ended up using my kids break I completely overreacted to a police officer who wouldn't. Yeah.

393
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.840
Mary Kastner: Uh huh. Yeah.

394
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.400
Galaxy A50: And it started because we were up in the air and I started bleeding really bad.

395
00:33:47.520 --> 00:34:03.750
Galaxy A50: Huh, so I'm pretty sure I had another episode like that on Saturday I was losing so much blood like I never my blood pressure never went down and I never felt dizzy or anything. I was getting very thirsty.

396
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:11.520
Galaxy A50: I lost a ridiculous amount of blood. If I, if I could safely go to the ER.

397
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.830
Galaxy A50: I would have I just because it was the second time it happened.

398
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:23.010
Galaxy A50: I kind of, at first I was like what the hell and then I'm like,

399
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:31.650
Galaxy A50: It's probably because I i guess i. It's called a hammer hammer a generic sister. Something I

400
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:41.160
Galaxy A50: went blank literally because I share a bathroom with somebody, so I can just be there the whole time I was in my room scanning over a trash can and just bleeding, though.

401
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.020
Galaxy A50: It was

402
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.670
Galaxy A50: I swear on my kids.

403
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:55.680
Galaxy A50: So, and it's this is why I know it's not necessarily a period because then I bled a little bit yesterday and nothing today.

404
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:06.570
Mary Kastner: Today. So did your behavior change because you when you had the police X incident, you're, you know, you were sort of Maliki yeah

405
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:21.420
Galaxy A50: Because it. Well, yes, this time because it's already happened before I was more aware. Plus, I wasn't in a public frickin place, you know, with a small child I was at least in my house and

406
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.150
Galaxy A50: At that time it was in the middle of the night and there was nobody around. Which is why I asked my son to go get help.

407
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.620
Galaxy A50: This way, at least if I painted or something, somebody would take care

408
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.230
Mary Kastner: Yeah, okay.

409
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:35.580
Galaxy A50: I

410
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.910
Mary Kastner: Didn't you plan on following up with a GYN when you

411
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.470
Galaxy A50: Can for sure.

412
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.870
Mary Kastner: Things are opened up. Okay. Okay.

413
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:53.580
Galaxy A50: It's just I got, I did, though. Speaking of depression I did get a little sad because I figured it's probably my one good ovary, giving him.

414
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.430
Galaxy A50: And I really did one for

415
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:09.420
Galaxy A50: Whatever my friend said that she will. She's very supportive. My well she's not really my friend. Well, she is my friend. She's also my sponsor.

416
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.680
Galaxy A50: And she said she'll try and find me cheap eggs.

417
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.080
Galaxy A50: Like a donor.

418
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.820
Galaxy A50: And just watch

419
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:29.910
Galaxy A50: One speech, tell me that my ovaries. Just don't produce any more, is what I'm going to meet Mr. Right. And

420
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:31.680
Galaxy A50: Is it

421
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.830
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I know, I know.

422
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.120
Mary Kastner: Well can you freeze an egg.

423
00:36:40.200 --> 00:37:01.170
Galaxy A50: Well, I should have thought about it earlier. Because right now, no matter what is not going to be good quality a plus i don't really have the money to do that. I was working toward it. At one point, and they they only got dare tell you this, that I already went through this before.

424
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.480
Mary Kastner: I thought so. Yeah, yeah.

425
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:11.400
Galaxy A50: You only got four, which is why I was thinking, and yes, and then we just kind of stopped because

426
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.350
Galaxy A50: There was nobody to fertilize them. But at that time.

427
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.450
Galaxy A50: But they also said that for as a ridiculously small amount, like

428
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:29.190
Galaxy A50: Let the actress train wreck lady. They had 35 taken out of her and only one was good quality.

429
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.610
Galaxy A50: And she's waiting on younger than me.

430
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.620
Mary Kastner: Or that's only one you can discuss when you get your GYN and point oh

431
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.080
Mary Kastner: Yeah yeah I don't

432
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:40.950
Galaxy A50: Do it.

433
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.760
Mary Kastner: Again, one

434
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.520
Mary Kastner: On the one hand, you're doing better. No, depression, except

435
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.860
Mary Kastner: With this one incident.

436
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:57.840
Mary Kastner: It more anxiety. How you doing with taking the I'll present them and then the to de

437
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.540
Galaxy A50: o le to this fine. I don't know if it's live to door, what I've been drinking a lot of water.

438
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.760
Mary Kastner: I'm thinking it's probably the

439
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.130
Galaxy A50: temperature change. I've been thirsty.

440
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.440
Mary Kastner: Yeah, but not excessively how much water a day do you think

441
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:24.630
Galaxy A50: Not that much. I'm not a big water drinker, period. So it's just usually I remind myself to drink water, but lately I've been creeping

442
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.250
Mary Kastner: Okay, so, um,

443
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.520
Mary Kastner: Any. Do you need any medication.

444
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:46.140
Galaxy A50: No, I'm good. I'm, I'm, I'm just what I do need, but I think I need to talk to Dr. Jamison about see my habit is to pull the mask over is

445
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:54.240
Galaxy A50: I, I, I need to pee in the cup moral my lawyer said that I need to do more drug testing.

446
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.150
Galaxy A50: And that's about it. So I'll

447
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.770
Mary Kastner: Talk to Jason about it.

448
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.890
Galaxy A50: I, I don't know, I feel like

449
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.690
Galaxy A50: What do you think, I don't know. I'm in a very strange mood since since the whole bleeding.

450
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.840
Mary Kastner: Have you been making benzodiazepines.

Mary Kastner: Well, why are you seeing Dr. Jamison

455
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:42.870
Galaxy A50: Oh, because of finding an order after hearing came out and my attorney needs another letter for from her because she's kind of like the MD in charge of me because last time she wrote a letter, and that's it. But I thought ben jones isn't that like anti anxiety.

456
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.340
Mary Kastner: Yes.

457
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:54.000
Galaxy A50: Like Xanax, I've never taken those I think like that. That's why I originally was smoking marijuana is because it's marijuana

458
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.490
Galaxy A50: Is just in and out. What is she testing you.

Mary Kastner: She just wants more. The lawyer just wants more proof of that.

468
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:30.270
Galaxy A50: Yeah, exactly, especially with the pandemic that I could, but I'm not doing it just because it takes. I mean, not just because I just want to stay even right now.

469
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.840
Galaxy A50: Not to have you been drinking alcohol.

470
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.130
Mary Kastner: No.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:41.220
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okay, so no substances, no marijuana no alcohol.

Galaxy A50: No, I have been smoking a lot of cigarettes.

473
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.140

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.660
Galaxy A50: Lately, probably a pack every conveys

475
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.610
Mary Kastner: Okay.

476
00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:01.500
Mary Kastner: So is that a that's probably a diagnosis. We needs to put on there for us. And it continues.

477
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:12.960
Mary Kastner: In no alcohol. You said, so if this, you know, gets to the point where you want to try some nicotine replacement. We can certainly do that.

478
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.490
Galaxy A50: I

479
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.520
Galaxy A50: I hate smoking. So yeah, pretty soon.

480
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.590
Mary Kastner: Uh huh. We give you

481
00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.100

482
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:26.850
Mary Kastner: Yeah, we can give you the patch. We can give you the gum. Have you ever tried Wellbutrin

483
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.520
Galaxy A50: Yeah. So the thing about it is

484
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:41.400
Galaxy A50: I can I, for whatever reason, I cigarettes. I've stopped and started before and I stopped with no consequences.

485
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.390
Galaxy A50: So I'm keeping that once everything comes down. I'll just stop ago

486
00:41:45.660 --> 00:42:00.540
Mary Kastner: Well, you just let Dr. Jamison, or I know if you want anything for that. And you don't need a tutor and you're not really having any side effects your sleep is good. Um, I would say extreme you know situational anxiety.

487
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:06.990
Mary Kastner: Still is an issue and, you know, continuing group because you use group very well.

488
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:08.550
Galaxy A50: Yeah.

489
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:14.700
Galaxy A50: I feel like you're better than then the other one, to be honest. Yeah, I find it very beneficial.

490
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:24.480
Mary Kastner: And you know, you can come to both. You can choose one. It's up to you, but let us know what your plan is both of us Jameson myself.

491
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:45.450
Mary Kastner: And, you know, I'm sorry that you're having to go through all this. It's a, it's incredibly stressful. In addition to, you know, environmentally what we're all going through, you have, you know, you kind of have an enormous stressors. But what I have found is the should have could is don't work.

492
00:42:46.560 --> 00:43:02.310
Mary Kastner: And you know, you just have to keep changing your positive you're thinking to positive thoughts because pretty soon you know they become behaviors. If it's negative, and then your behaviors, you know, can change your personality so

493
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:13.680
Mary Kastner: You know, work on day at a time. Gratitude positive thoughts and keep letting us know checking in, in group and

494
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:19.920
Mary Kastner: You know Let me know when you need another refill, or if you decide that you need something in addition to that,

495
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:36.930
Galaxy A50: Sure. Could I ask a question. This is just, I must have too much time on my hands is there. Is this a disorder of some kind, where a person is not exactly as mature as they should be, for their age, or is it just an external factors.

496
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.240
Mary Kastner: What do you, what do you mean yes mature.

497
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:51.570
Galaxy A50: I feel that my personal maturity is delayed like i i'm not a 42 year old mature woman, that's for sure.

498
00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.100
Galaxy A50: You froze.

499
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.180
Mary Kastner: I don't think so.

500
00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:58.950
I don't agree with you there.

501
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.290
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

502
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.380
Mary Kastner: You there. Yeah, I think.

503
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:12.060
Mary Kastner: You know what you're suffering from my dear is a, you know, probably some personality issues because of the horrendous, you know,

504
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.800
Mary Kastner: Growing up that you described with your parenting.

505
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.560
Mary Kastner: But also a bipolar.

506
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:27.630
Mary Kastner: Can you just kind of go up and down with your mood and that is a bipolar disorder to to to disorder. Okay.

507
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.530
Galaxy A50: I would have to talk to you more about the first thing you said, but you probably have another

508
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.480
Mary Kastner: Well, the personality.

509
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.930
Mary Kastner: Can be a diagnoses.

510
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:55.530
Mary Kastner: That the only way to treat that is, you know, really good long term therapy and, you know, I think you have insight into how your parenting has affected you and you have an ego.

511
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:08.130
Mary Kastner: That's developed pretty strongly around that. So, you know, that's a strength. So again, what I like to have you do is focus on those strengths

512
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.470
Galaxy A50: Okay, I'll Oh no. Yeah.

513
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.150

514
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:24.090
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I think you're right on there are some personality issues, but you came out of a fire as far as relationships with your parents.

515
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.500
Mary Kastner: Right. And you were survivor, of course, you're gonna have scarring for now.

516
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.410
Galaxy A50: Okay, okay.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:27.450
Mary Kastner: So, um, we have that recording and, you know, sometimes I'll kind of talk to the air. It's because I'm talking to this transcriptionist in front of you to kind of clarify that I got the facts right

545
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.320
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, and

546
00:47:50.880 --> 00:48:01.050
Galaxy Note10+: I'm a little nervous that I might, you know, break because I haven't been taken it. I was wondering if I could get a prescription of my Prozac called in at some point.

547
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.140

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:27.480
Galaxy Note10+: Um,

559
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.500
Galaxy Note10+: That's pretty much it. I just

560
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:38.550
Galaxy Note10+: I am you've probably seen the notes that I had an event, a few weeks ago.

561
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:52.650
Galaxy Note10+: I was maybe I should start from the beginning. I work construction for many years. My God was a general contractor. When I was 21 I blew my back out really bad and

562
00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:19.860
Galaxy Note10+: And you know I was around 2000 and I've been on hardcore pain meds. Ever since, you know, I mean, like, really high doses of stuff. I mean like 120 10 milligram methadone tabs, a month, along with 120 30 milligram oxycodone tabs along with 60 value, you know, so I was

563
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.250
Galaxy Note10+: At a high dose for very long.

564
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:30.090
Galaxy Note10+: And then, you know, we all know the roadmap and where it goes. After that, you know, when

565
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.630
Galaxy Note10+: Things are getting too pricey on the street, you know,

566
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.390
Galaxy Note10+: You move to that heavier stuff. And that's kind of what happened.

567
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:41.100
Galaxy Note10+: So,

568
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:43.950
Galaxy Note10+: I went on Suboxone

569
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.740
Mary Kastner: When did you move to heavier stuff.

570
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.160
Mary Kastner: And you get into heroin is that was

571
00:49:50.940 --> 00:50:07.290
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, like the last, the last two years. Yeah, not super heavy but dabbling, you know, while I still have my pills, you know, if I was out of my pills. Maybe I dabble with that for a couple of days until I could get what I needed you know

572
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.590
Galaxy Note10+: Did you ever sleep.

573
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:11.910
Galaxy Note10+: Yo, yeah.

574
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.220
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, that's all.

575
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.220
Mary Kastner: And where would you use it in your body.

576
00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.340
Galaxy Note10+: My hands are my arms.

577
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.290
Mary Kastner: Okay, can I see them.

578
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.670
Mary Kastner: Oh, that's your arms.

579
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:30.180
Okay.

580
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.030
Galaxy Note10+: So, okay, but you know they're not

581
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.340
Mary Kastner: So you have some

582
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:37.740
Galaxy Note10+: Some

583
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.490
Mary Kastner: Can you hold it out right there.

584
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.210
Mary Kastner: Can you hold out your arm in front of the camera, so I can see it.

585
00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:59.400
Mary Kastner: Okay and so above your anecdotal FOSS on the left there was a little mark. How about it on the right.

586
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.870
Galaxy Note10+: There right there.

587
00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:01.710
Mary Kastner: Yeah, they're

588
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.490
Mary Kastner: Okay, some tracks old. Yeah, sorry.

589
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:08.550
Galaxy Note10+: Two weeks, two weeks ago I

590
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:10.860
Galaxy Note10+: I i

591
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:18.360
Galaxy Note10+: I made a serious judgment and error and I bounced the Suboxone for for a while.

592
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.840
Galaxy Note10+: When went through that withdrawal and then

593
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:31.020
Galaxy Note10+: Had a lot of trouble sleeping, about a month after that. And so I took a I took a few clonazepam and

594
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:48.750
Galaxy Note10+: It was kind of like someone hold an arrow back on a boat and just let it go. I was like a heat seeking missile. After that, and you know I I went in and I used and and I overdosed. You know,

595
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.880
Galaxy Note10+: woke up in the hospital.

596
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:52.860
Galaxy Note10+: And

597
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.360
Mary Kastner: When was that

598
00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.150
Galaxy Note10+: Was like a couple weeks ago.

Galaxy Note10+: I'm okay. I'm just taking like you know 800 milligrams of Tylenol or whatever but

650
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.930
Galaxy Note10+: I think I'm confident, if

651
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:19.080

653
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:30.840

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.490
Galaxy Note10+: It was

659
00:55:50.670 --> 00:56:02.520
Galaxy Note10+: It was spotty because I had a doctor given me all those meds. So when I would run out, or if I couldn't get what I needed. Then I would go to something else that would do the trick for cheaper, you know,

660
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:06.390
Mary Kastner: So now you don't have a doctor, giving you these minutes

661

676
00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:14.100
Galaxy Note10+: It's good for what it does, but it's hard to get off for that stuff. I mean, just as hard as the other stuff maybe harder. I mean, I was sick for a long time for like solid OxyContin withdrawals for of seven days and then a fever for three or four days. I mean, it was pretty ugly.

705
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:32.190
Galaxy Note10+: Hmm.

706
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.900

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:54.000
Mary Kastner: I'm recommending you stay on the Suboxone

714
00:59:55.050 --> 01:00:03.330
Galaxy Note10+: But I've already done the withdrawal. I can't, I'm not gonna put myself through that again. And I was really slow and doped up on that stuff. It made me high

715
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:09.750

753
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:14.310
Galaxy Note10+: And I was accused of like abusing my kids, somehow, and they brought up charges on me and

758
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.870
Mary Kastner: Uh huh. So you still have these intrusive thoughts that come into your head about that.

759
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.820
Galaxy Note10+: Well, what I can always tell when my PTSD turn

760
01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:10.770

Galaxy Note10+: Yes.

767
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.750
Galaxy Note10+: TSP hasn't turned up. I mean, since I've been

768
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:31.710
Galaxy Note10+: A couple weeks I've

769
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:41.910
Galaxy Note10+: Just been riding a bike every day riding my bike 14 to 20 miles and then coming home and sleeping and I mean it's made my

770
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.210
Galaxy Note10+: My, my mental feel much better.

771
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.730
Mary Kastner: Yeah, thank you sleep too much.

772
01:04:50.190 --> 01:05:00.090
Galaxy Note10+: No I don't sleep too much ice I last night I slept all night because I did the 20 mile ride. What other wise if I don't exercise until I sleep.

773
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:12.900
Galaxy Note10+: Then I'm up all night until like six in the morning, and I'll sleep from, like, six to 1030 or 11 and that messes me all up, you know, it gets my schedule all backwards and that's pretty

774
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.490
Mary Kastner: Has anybody ever told you that that they thought you might have a little mania.

775
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.380
Galaxy Note10+: You know, no. Nobody's

776
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.270
Galaxy Note10+: You know, I've seen a lot of

777
01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.340
Galaxy Note10+: counselors and Frank's but

778
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:33.870
Galaxy Note10+: I've never, I've only gotten the PTSD and the the opioid disorder thing, you know, but

779
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.090
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, I don't ever

780
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.690

Galaxy Note10+: No, no I I kicked back. You know what I mean.

782
01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:45.900
Galaxy Note10+: I kicked

783
01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.870
Mary Kastner: Back and you think that Prozac helps you

784
01:05:50.220 --> 01:06:02.850
Galaxy Note10+: It helps me to not be as aggressive. You know I can. I think I can get maybe kind of manic when I get angry and I continue to talk about whatever's you know going on the argument or whatever.

785
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.350
Galaxy Note10+: But

786
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:07.980
Mary Kastner: What do you mean, what, how do you get when you get aggressive

787
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:23.070
Galaxy Note10+: I'm probably i guess i get loud and and uncomfortable to talk to you. I get, you know, it's like a switch goes off or something that's probably as manic as I get when I'm angry, you know,

788
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.890
Mary Kastner: Are you able to see your daughters now.

The next week for, you know, family court so they haven't going court back to back to back, they were they were playing a mind game with me what they wanted to do was make me break and give the kids back

796
01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.290
Galaxy Note10+: They were pretty smart about what they did.

797
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:16.140
Galaxy Note10+: And I can see that now but but before you know I was so scared. You know, I was afraid I was gonna go prison for the rest of my life, you know, for something I didn't do it if it fucked me up pretty good, you know, really.

798
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.840

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:55.140
Mary Kastner: Do you feel like

1204
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:58.380
Mary Kastner: You could be suicidal again.

1205
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:03.720
Galaxy Note10+: I mean you know that's hypothetical. I mean, what does that do

1206
01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:05.250
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1207
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:11.400
Galaxy Note10+: I can't gauge what's gonna happen in the future, you know, that's why I'm trying to do this.

1208
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:12.330
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1209
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:18.540
Galaxy Note10+: Ever if I was gonna do that. I would have

1210
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.910
Galaxy Note10+: Done that in 2011

1211
01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:25.620
Mary Kastner: So suicide risk assessment is a

1212
01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:32.130
Mary Kastner: Moderate because you're male, and you did have some ideation right after the relapse.

1213
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:38.760
Mary Kastner: Do you have a suicide risk suicide hotline telephone number.

1214
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:44.820
Mary Kastner: Jason

1215
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:52.710
Mary Kastner: We've had difficulty, along with our connection, we should probably be put in the note.

1216
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:55.380
Mary Kastner: Jason

1217
01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.780
Mary Kastner: Hello, so a 30 minute intake is taking me an hour.

1218
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:06.720
Mary Kastner: So I'm just gonna, if I can get him back. I would

1219
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:10.050
Mary Kastner: Continue with the plan that I had

1220
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.600
Mary Kastner: Jason

1221
01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.400
Mary Kastner: Jason. Yes. Do you have the suicide crisis hotline telephone number.

1222
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.470
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah.

1223
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.800
Mary Kastner: Is it in your phone is in handy.

1224
01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.570
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah yeah 911 no

1225
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:37.320
Mary Kastner: No, I want you to write it down. I'm going to give it to you.

1226
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.870
Galaxy Note10+: Oh no, it's fine. If I was going to do that. I wouldn't call anyone so just. All right.

1227
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:48.690
Galaxy Note10+: Hey, how

1228
01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.840
Galaxy Note10+: Do you have your plan.

1229
01:40:53.610 --> 01:40:55.350
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, that's fun. Take it off.

1230
01:40:59.340 --> 01:40:59.760
Mary Kastner: Um,

1231
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:02.940
Mary Kastner: You've done something you're not happy about.

1232
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.400
Mary Kastner: So I want you to write it down again. Okay.

1233
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:27.840
Mary Kastner: Okay, it's one 802 738 to five, five

1234
01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:30.750
Galaxy Note10+: You know,

1235
01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.890
Galaxy Note10+: I'm not gonna call it, but okay. Thank you.

1236
01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:36.780
Mary Kastner: Um,

1237
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:52.350
Mary Kastner: Anyway, to share with you my thoughts. Uh, I think that you have a bipolar two disorder. It's hard to, it's hard to tell because probably as many times as you have

1238
01:41:53.490 --> 01:42:01.230
Mary Kastner: As many years as you've been using opioids. It's going to take them many years to get you cleared enough so we know what your baseline is

1239
01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:01.650
Galaxy Note10+: You see,

1240
01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.140
Mary Kastner: So it's hard to tell.

1241
01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:21.960
Mary Kastner: I also think there's a possibility of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which we could help you with some medication with both of these things. I think you have PTSD and I think you have an opioid use disorder in new very new remission.

1242
01:42:23.190 --> 01:42:37.380
Mary Kastner: Um, so I have no problem with giving you the processing for the night. Mears I would not want to restart the Prozac unless we had a mood stabilizer on board.

1243
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:57.630
Mary Kastner: Is my goal is to get you sleeping routinely every night a minimum of six hours on interrupted and to keep you, you know, in a fear mood, like you are today, but to lower any kind of risk taking behaviors that you might have that could lead to injury self injury.

1244
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.580
Galaxy Note10+: Right. Um,

1245
01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:14.730
Mary Kastner: And of course keep you comfortable because pain is going to cause you to want to use again. So we want to have a goal would be to maintain your abstinence and to maintain your comfort.

1246
01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.380
Mary Kastner: So,

1247
01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.910
Mary Kastner: I would recommend something like lithium.

1248
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:37.170
Mary Kastner: Who, it's a normal mineral in the body. People that are not bipolar to their full bipolar, they can take up to 1500 2000 3000 milligrams, what I would recommend is 300

1249
01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:43.710
Mary Kastner: And you just see if it helps with some of those objectives of getting you to sleep.

1250
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.340
Mary Kastner: Retaining keeping your mood stable.

1251
01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.590
Mary Kastner: And not not having any kind of irritability or

1252
01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:59.730
Mary Kastner: You know, there are other things we can use, but it is the best antidepressant out there, it

1253
01:44:00.210 --> 01:44:02.220
Mary Kastner: may not even need the Prozac.

1254
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:14.250
Mary Kastner: Prozac. It's going to be in your system for about six weeks. So you're not going to feel any withdrawal from it for a while, but then you may, you know you met me your mood may drop and I don't

1255
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.480
Mary Kastner: Think it's wise to give you an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer on board.

1256
01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:23.130
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, so what would the mood stabilizer beat the lithium.

1257
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:25.350
Mary Kastner: Lithium. Yeah, very low dose.

1258
01:44:25.770 --> 01:44:30.120
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, I'm talking like really, I'm very anti drug right now.

1259
01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:36.930
Mary Kastner: Because, oh, you are. This is a mineral in the body, it's, it's on the periodic table. We all have lithium in our system.

1260
01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:38.430
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1261
01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.110
Mary Kastner: So that's my idea.

1262
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:43.620
Mary Kastner: Another idea. There are other

1263
01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.690
Mary Kastner: mood stabilizers, we can use but

1264
01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.330
Mary Kastner: This is the natural one

1265
01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:55.080
Galaxy Note10+: Lithium just scares the crap out of me because I've known people that have taken it and they were really nuts, you know,

1266
01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:03.180
Galaxy Note10+: Well, that's why. That's why I said bipolar too and I didn't say 1500 milligrams, or, you know,

1267
01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:08.640
Galaxy Note10+: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll

1268
01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.310
Galaxy Note10+: Take your advice and and do whatever you say you know

1269
01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:31.650
Mary Kastner: Then if you're on lithium. One of the things that we do with the labs, is we make sure that your kidney functions. I'm fine. In that your thyroid, which is a routine lab anyway because we want to check that for depression.

1270
01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:40.140
Mary Kastner: The VM is a salt. So it is excluded by the kidneys. So we have to make sure your kidneys functioning well

1271
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:52.530
Mary Kastner: If you like it, and you think it might be helping a little bit or if it's not doing anything. We may have to increase it. And in that case, we need to get lithium level in your blood. We need to get a blood test for that.

1272
01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:55.830
Mary Kastner: If you sweat a lot

1273
01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:06.900
Mary Kastner: And you don't hydrate like on these long bike rides, or you're out doing some kind of work where you're sweating a lot. You have to stay hydrated.

1274
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:09.720
Mary Kastner: Because again,

1275
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:12.690
Mary Kastner: If you're dehydrated, guess what happens to the lithium.

1276
01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:15.660
Galaxy Note10+: swept out

1277
01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:17.550
Mary Kastner: Yeah, goes up.

1278
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:19.020
Galaxy Note10+: It goes up.

1279
01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.630
Mary Kastner: And then you wind up with toxicity.

1280
01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:24.120
Galaxy Note10+: No, that's not good.

1281
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:27.960
Mary Kastner: And that can affect you in many ways, including

1282
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:31.590
Mary Kastner: The big sinus diarrhea.

1283
01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:43.080
Mary Kastner: And nausea. So, but it can do other things too. So you always have to stay hydrated on lithium and there's no way you can take things like an inset

1284
01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:52.740
Mary Kastner: With Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory. So the Tylenol would be better, which is what

1285
01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:53.730
Galaxy Note10+: I don't, I

1286
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.380
Galaxy Note10+: Don't take Advil or ibuprofen really because it makes my ears bring more

1287
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:03.510
Mary Kastner: Yeah, and that's another good thing you can't take that with lithium. OK.

1288
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:15.960
Mary Kastner: Ok ok so the order the processing in the lithium. I want to see you in two weeks and then we'll determine. Well, actually, I'd like to see you in a week after you start the lithium.

1289
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:25.560
Mary Kastner: And then we'll determine whether or not we need to stay there or go up in the dose. I want to look at your labs and review them with you. So you'll go to get your labs before that.

1290
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:26.490
Week appointment.

1291
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.080
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1292
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:37.320
Mary Kastner: Okay. Okay, any other questions, you know, eventually we may want to start you on something for the attention deficit.

1293
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.040
Mary Kastner: So you can focus a little bit more. That's up to you.

1294
01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.000
Mary Kastner: But I

1295
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:48.690
Mary Kastner: Don't want to do that or the Prozac with out giving you a mood stabilizer. First, I think it's dangerous.

1296
01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:58.410
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, what about mean not taking the Prozac anymore. What's going on with that you said Dan my body, a long time.

1297
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:04.110
Mary Kastner: Six weeks. Yeah, we'll know how your mood is you may not even need it. The lithium made do what you need.

1298
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.320
Galaxy Note10+: Okay, yeah, I'll give it a shot.

1299
01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:19.260
Mary Kastner: And like I said, if you don't like this. There are certainly other medications that we could try

1300
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:21.870
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1301
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:27.510
Mary Kastner: I always start with this because it's as old as the is we started using it in 1950s.

1302
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:30.450
Mary Kastner: So we have a lot of data.

1303
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:33.300
Mary Kastner: About how well it works.

1304
01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:34.980
Mary Kastner: You want to

1305
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:39.840
Mary Kastner: If this makes you nauseated. You need to let me know I'm

1306
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:44.340
Mary Kastner: take it with food.

1307
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:48.660
Mary Kastner: So I'm going to give you 150 milligrams

1308
01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:54.060
Mary Kastner: In your take one for a couple days and then you'll go to two

1309
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.950
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1310
01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:21.210
Mary Kastner: Now the process and we can start at one. But again, if it's not helping you within nightmares. You can go up to as long as you're

1311
01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:29.400
Mary Kastner: monitoring your blood pressure in your course.

1312
01:50:31.650 --> 01:50:32.130
Galaxy Note10+: All right.

1313
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:35.370
Mary Kastner: And I could usually people take it a bit time

1314
01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.740
Mary Kastner: And the same with the lithium.

1315
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:39.270
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1316
01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:14.040
Mary Kastner: Okay, any

1317
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:20.010
Mary Kastner: Any kind of hint that you're going to relapse.

1318
01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.500
Mary Kastner: And hint.

1319
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.420
Galaxy Note10+: You, God will

1320
01:51:25.590 --> 01:51:30.510
Mary Kastner: You Paul and we will get you into a medication.

1321
01:51:31.890 --> 01:51:32.400
Mary Kastner: Treatment

1322
01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:35.640
Remember,

1323
01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:43.650
Mary Kastner: What I said this is a chronic relapsing disease that is life threatening.

1324
01:51:45.210 --> 01:51:46.560
Galaxy Note10+: Yeah, that's true.

1325
01:51:49.530 --> 01:51:49.830
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1326
01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:54.480
Mary Kastner: Well, for Pete's sake. They didn't put in any of your lab orders. Oh.

1327
01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:55.950
Mary Kastner: makes me mad.

1328
01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:21.660
Mary Kastner: Why don't you wait till you've gotten to to have the lithium.

1329
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:26.700
Mary Kastner: Before you get your labs done

1330
01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:39.450
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1331
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:41.340
Galaxy Note10+: Okay.

1332
01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.160
Mary Kastner: So you can take one lithium.

1333
01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:50.790
Mary Kastner: A day for two days. And you're going to go to two for two days and then get your labs done

1334
01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.960
Galaxy Note10+: All right. Okay. And it'll be on the bottle to

1335
01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:58.350
Mary Kastner: The labs will not be on the bottle. No.

1336
01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.010
Galaxy Note10+: No, I mean the

1337
01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:01.710
Mary Kastner: The directions. Right.

1338
01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:04.350
Mary Kastner: Yeah. Okay, any questions for me.

1339
01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:12.030
Galaxy Note10+: No process in just take one at bedtime. When I take the lithium.

1340
01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:16.590
Mary Kastner: Yeah, if it's doing nothing, which you probably won't do meaning with the nightmares.

1341
01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:18.390
Mary Kastner: Then you can go to

1342
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.760
Mary Kastner: Lunch.

1343
01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:22.800
Mary Kastner: On into your pulse and blood pressure.

1344
01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:26.670
Mary Kastner: Okay, make an appointment with me in one week.

1345
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:29.970
Galaxy Note10+: Okay. And how do I achieve that the

1346
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:31.620
Mary Kastner: Appointment call back into

1347
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:37.500
Mary Kastner: To the front desk and tell them to send your lab orders and make an appointment with me in a week.
