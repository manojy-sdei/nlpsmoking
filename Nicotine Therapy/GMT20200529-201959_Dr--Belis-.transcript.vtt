00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Any no plans.

98
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.410
No.

99
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Alright, so in terms of medication.

100
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.740
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you

101
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you open to trying the Suboxone again.

102
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.940
Yeah.

103
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, I think that maybe

104
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: If we get you to get on the right dose, you'll probably

105
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feel okay

106
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.840
LG Phoenix Plus: I mean, the point is to get on enough of the medication to feel

107
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.320
LG Phoenix Plus: Like

108
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: You don't have withdrawal and you don't have cravings.

109
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.220
Yeah.

110
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.440
LG Phoenix Plus: About when it stops.

111
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.900
LG Phoenix Plus: Working and taking it for such amount of time and it stops working. What do they do that, what do you do when it stops working.

112
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:28.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it shouldn't stop working. There's people should not develop a tolerance to Suboxone unlike the other opioids. This one you don't really develop a tolerance. So my guess is that you weren't on high enough of a dose to begin with.

113
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.370
Maybe

114
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or or it was working, but you got distracted with other

115
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, maybe your environment change you had temptations. I don't know, but

116
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: A medication usually

117
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:51.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: If it works, it just continues to work it shouldn't change in its potency, you know. Yeah.

118
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.510
Yeah.

119
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.280
I was

120
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Sorry.

121
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.440
LG Phoenix Plus: It was a dosage. I don't know.

122
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:07.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it could be that the dose. Wasn't high enough so how much money are you spending on the heroin or how, how would you quantify it. Do you know in grams, how much you're using

123
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.750
LG Phoenix Plus: Shoot three to four grams a day.

124
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.800
Okay.

125
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

126
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so I would say

127
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um,

128
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:31.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think we should try giving you the eight milligram films, but instead of it looks like they were trying to give it to twice a day. I'm going to try to increase it to three times a day.

129
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.160
LG Phoenix Plus: Okay.

130
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:40.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: And see if that holds you over better see if you know okay yeah I feel comfortable. I don't have cravings. I'm not thinking about heroin.

131
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm okay.

132
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:50.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah and you know you've done this before. So you know that in order to take your first dose, you need to be in withdrawal.

133
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, so you just have to wait a little bit

134
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:03.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And feel like, you know, feel some physical symptoms. The sweating. The you know teary eyes, whatever stomach cramping.

135
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, goosebumps, whatever it is that you feel when you're sick.

136
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:16.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then once you have two or three of those signs like physical signs, then you know you're ready to take it.

137
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you'll you'll take it under your tongue, you let it melt under your tongue.

138
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that it gets into your system yeah and and it should kick in within like 10 minutes

139
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: So let's try that. Let's try one film three times a day. All right.

140
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that'll that'll be good.

141
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:59.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: The only concern I have is your Ambien Ambien is a sedative and do you take that every day because with Suboxone, it can be kind of dangerous well with any opioids. So you're using heroin. I suppose you've been okay so far, how often, how often do you take it.

142
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.280
LG Phoenix Plus: When I need it.

143
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, occasional yeah okay okay just just

144
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: What else, what else any, do you have any questions or concerns about like the medication or how to take it.

145
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:24.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: No. Okay. And do you think you can meet up with us once a week.

146
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.110
Yeah.

147
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

148
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.050

286
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Doing treatment for hep C or

287
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.310

288
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:39.150
LG Phoenix Plus: He started one we had triple meds and it was too long. So maybe six months, the six month mark has just happened so receive. How many

289
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:51.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah, they have some really good treatments nowadays that like over 90% of people respond well and get rid of get rid of that virus for good.

290
00:20:52.650 --> 00:21:09.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which is really cool. I think if you can get, get into the treatment that's good for you because you know it may make you feel tired, it may cause these kind of vague symptoms and then over time it can cause cancer and things. So we don't want you don't want that.

291

Dr. Belis Aladag: So if you can get the treatment, get back into that idea. Once you know, of course, we want you to be sober, first and foremost, but after that, I think the next step is like trying to get you to the hep C treatments.
