00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:39.630
Jessica Adams: My dad would snap whatever mood or whatever he thinks that he's doing it.

105
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.760
Jessica Adams: Because it's not healthy. Like, I mean,

106
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.580

111
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:27.420
Richelle Direny: But you, but then it's but but this is not unfamiliar territory, because you know your dad has kind of been somewhat wishy washy in kind of what he does. Like one minute. He's with you in another minute. He's not so it's kind of always been a roller coaster ride with you and you're not

112
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.080
Jessica Adams: Right, but I'd be that that still can ever be changed. Maybe that's not even what by Bob, would it

113
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.640
Jessica Adams: You know, so I

114
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:49.650
Jessica Adams: I don't know, like I I filled out you know power of attorney words, as I've been. I haven't done anything wasn't yet.

115
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:59.760
Jessica Adams: Maybe I'm not saying that that's going to happen to me because I you know I don't feel that there is, but I don't want

116
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:07.080
Jessica Adams: My dad and my business. You know, I want my sort of a, this is a tribute

117
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:14.460
Jessica Adams: You know, say I just feel that that that should only be fair. You know what I mean.

118
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.650
Jessica Adams: Uh huh. And

119
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:25.950
Jessica Adams: Are they happy with it probably right. Or they don't accept it. They're gonna have to eventually it's my choice.

120
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.090
Jessica Adams: But I

121
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.120
Richelle Direny: So things have gotten better overall with you and your son, the relationship

122
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.490

123
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.740
Jessica Adams: Girlfriend that

124
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.410
Jessica Adams: The charges were pressed on

125
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.150
Jessica Adams: The tour de said that if I didn't go that they were dropped them.

126
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.370
Jessica Adams: So,

127
00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:01.620
Jessica Adams: I really didn't want the charges pressed to begin with. I never press. That's where I tried you know to explain to buy some

128
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.980
Jessica Adams: And he, I don't think he believed me at first.

129
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.470
Jessica Adams: Until be in him with both with down to talk to the lady and

130
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:25.920
Jessica Adams: They told me they were like, yeah, she didn't she didn't know. So, you know, the state packed up because there were supposed injuries. So

131
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.800
Jessica Adams: Bottom line is, is I didn't go to the

132
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.950
Jessica Adams: Court Hearing

133
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.790

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.130
Richelle Direny: I didn't. You didn't go to the Court.

135
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.950
Jessica Adams: Yeah, I mean I didn't want to see my son, unhappy, you know, in a lead and that would have just made him more miserable.

136
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:51.990
Jessica Adams: So,

137
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.430
Jessica Adams: I just kind of like left it at that. You know what I mean.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:27.570
Jessica Adams: I feel about the whole thing. Yes. Why, you know, just to get some stuff off my chest.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.000
Jessica Adams: Is, you know, for him as well to

215
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:49.440
Jessica Adams: I mean I'm not saying like right away you know it's it's gonna take time. Because, you know, I want to make sure I say everything that I want to say.

216
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:50.610
Mm hmm.

217
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.300
Jessica Adams: To aim, so that way. I'm not holding back no regrets or anything like that.

218
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.590
Jessica Adams: I just don't understand you. Like I said about the

219
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:25.650
Jessica Adams: You know, why is he, you know, on the brother pick everything. Why is he giving everything to my brother. You know what I mean, like, that was ever that was ever. My dad before

220
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.740
Jessica Adams: You know, and he's already signed the house over to my brother. If anything happens to lead.

221
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.580
Jessica Adams: It is just

222
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.510
Jessica Adams: You know, and it's not about it. He is that it's about

223
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:55.680
Jessica Adams: He treats. My brother like he's this guy or he's up here of this high mounted in he treats me away, sister, like, We're nothing

224
00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.040
Jessica Adams: You know, so I just it, it kind of makes us wonder

225
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.440
Richelle Direny: Um, I know that. Not that I know um

226
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.090
Richelle Direny: How is the relationship with your sister and your father.

227
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.630
Jessica Adams: They don't go, they don't talk at all.

228
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.500
Jessica Adams: Because my sister has been

229
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:31.290
Jessica Adams: molested her children and

230
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.520
Jessica Adams: That's this is what my sister was telling everybody but um

231
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.150
Jessica Adams: If that was a case you he would have already been to jail because this was like

232
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.090
Jessica Adams: A couple years ago.

233
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.080
Mm hmm.

234
00:24:52.980 --> 00:25:15.480
Jessica Adams: One of our other family members children got the same thing done yet, though, there's a case opened up on that in the she could lose her kids at any given time, you know, so we don't know what to believe about my sister.

235
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.800
Richelle Direny: Um, so you don't really

236
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.330
Richelle Direny: Sure, if

237
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.150
Jessica Adams: You

238
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.010
Jessica Adams: Talk to her, but I don't

239
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.760
Jessica Adams: I don't believe everything that

240
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.110
Jessica Adams: She's

241
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:35.970
Not

242
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:43.530
Jessica Adams: Because I need it you know she's got addictive personalities as well.

243
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.780
Jessica Adams: So I really don't go down and stay with them.

244
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:56.040
Jessica Adams: Like issue was to me out public is go to dinner or something. That's fine.

245
00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.950
Jessica Adams: But I really don't hang out with her.

246
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.700
Jessica Adams: I mean I'll watch her kids for her. She's got a work, but I'm gone right after that.

247
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.540
Jessica Adams: I don't want any extra

248
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.230
Jessica Adams: added stress and what I need.

249
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.420
Richelle Direny: That's fair name.

250
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.130
Richelle Direny: Um,

251
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.700
Richelle Direny: You said you did sure that you have a family history of mental illness. Right.

252
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:28.140
Yeah.

253
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.070
Jessica Adams: Yeah yeah

254
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:43.470
Richelle Direny: But it sounds like there is some degree on your part. And I think we've discussed this in the past, but there's some degree of codependency maybe with your dad like you and your dad.

255
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.540
Richelle Direny: It's like you're some degree of acceptance from him and

256
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:56.100
Richelle Direny: His awareness of that codependency maybe there's a codependency on both your parts.

257
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.570
Right.

258
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.400
Jessica Adams: It. Yeah, I mean it.

259
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.820
Jessica Adams: Like I just

260
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.300
Jessica Adams: Don't know what to think about the whole situation with my brother. I got

261
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.820
Jessica Adams: My six up worrying my you don't believe me.

262
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:33.690
Jessica Adams: Why, he didn't let everybody pick everything and he just let my brother do it you know

263
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.090
Jessica Adams: I just, it's

264
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.410
Jessica Adams: I don't think it was really fair, honestly.

265
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.710
Jessica Adams: But

266
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.210
Jessica Adams: So,

267
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.710
I mean, I mean,

268
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.770
Jessica Adams: The word accepted but

269
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.580
Jessica Adams: And I'm just gonna let my son.

270
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.870
Jessica Adams: Take care of myself.

271
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:22.710
Richelle Direny: You said that you said that you just, um, I think part of it is, it's that human. I think you and I spoke about this before. There's a sense of belonging that you know you feel like you don't

272
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:39.510
Richelle Direny: Necessarily long and you're looking for that either from your father or for through your Son. And each time you know you don't feel those those expectations are being met by any one of your family members it you know

273
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:40.890
Jessica Adams: Where I

274
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.280
Richelle Direny: See me so it feel discouraging and you feel like

275
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:57.030
Richelle Direny: On right so you try to seek that attention by any means, you don't necessarily and I think especially when it comes on to your dad because he talks about having a pretty close relationship with your mom.

276
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.270
Richelle Direny: And being that your mom is no longer around you seek it from your dad. But then your dad.

277
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.810
Richelle Direny: You know, whatever the relationship is between

278
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:16.110
Richelle Direny: Him and your brother, maybe there is some degree of codependency there. And so you're kind of fighting for that.

279
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:27.540
Richelle Direny: Attention from your dad's was kind of like your you and your brother is fighting for that attention, but somehow based on what you're seeing your, your brother gets it more often more from your dad.

280
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.140
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

281
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.580
Richelle Direny: So it's like a region in terms of what's going on between you, your sister and your brother and your dad.

282
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:41.790
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

283
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.240
Jessica Adams: Yeah, pretty much.

284
00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.790
Jessica Adams: Um, you know, just like my, my sister, you know,

285
00:29:52.140 --> 00:30:11.130
Jessica Adams: She tried to message. My dad something though, I think it was happy birthday or something. And he was like, yeah, don't message me don't work okay by any blocker. You know, so that's the type of responses. My sister. Can you know

286
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.030
Jessica Adams: So,

287
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.070
Jessica Adams: He's, he's pretty frustrated and bad at my sister.

288
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:28.290
Jessica Adams: Because he thinks that the time that my sister had spent with my mom.

289
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:52.620
Jessica Adams: When she had moved. He got away from her husband that my dad, could my dad thinks that he could have been at home with my mom is sort of my sister being having my mom down there at her house, but it. I mean, my mom was the one that chose to pay for the deposit and stuff that my dad.

290
00:30:53.790 --> 00:31:07.200
Jessica Adams: You know I'm in chose to go down there and stay with my sister and my dad. Oh, wow. That is so you know it's not really invasive response, either.

291
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:22.470
Jessica Adams: So I just kind of look at it like you know maybe things will change and get better. And if they don't, they don't. But in the end I have to remember that I am

292
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:36.810
Jessica Adams: Struggling with my own issues right now and I mean I can't get myself in the middle of my brother and my sisters

293
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.800
Jessica Adams: You know, they have to fight their, you know,

294
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:42.930
Jessica Adams: Own

295
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.420
Jessica Adams: Own issues.

296
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.650
Jessica Adams: I just

297
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.370
Jessica Adams: Don't know.

298
00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:05.910
Jessica Adams: I don't. My mom wouldn't want to see that the lifeless in the way that it's falling apart. I mean, in my event just passed away two

299
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:13.800
Jessica Adams: So, but, you know, it's just a very sad, you know,

300
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.250
Jessica Adams: Situation right now and

301
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.380
Jessica Adams: I just, you know, I would do anything to bring my love back

302
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:38.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And what then okay but for a moment in your, your mind and in everything, because I know in Italy when we were meeting you talks about

303
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:48.360
Richelle Direny: You know, your mom is no longer suffering and even though you've missed her physically but you know that she's no longer suffering. But the question is,

304
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:48.780
Jessica Adams: When you

305
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.740
That

306
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.710
Richelle Direny: You know, you will do anything to bring her back now.

307
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:03.090
Richelle Direny: I want you to kind of express like in your thoughts in your mind. Like, what does that mean for you right now.

308
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:15.570
Richelle Direny: Is it she'll just come kind of fulfill that sense of belonging that you desire from your family that you're not getting like what is that to bring her back is to fulfill what need for you right now.

309
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.550
Jessica Adams: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that's what it is.

310
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:37.110
Jessica Adams: Like it would, you know, I mean, I don't feel like our families complete it all, you know, and it is we're missing a big huge piece of it, but the part that we're missing is

311
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.560
Jessica Adams: The part that out everybody together.

312
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.120
Richelle Direny: With you regarding your mom.

313
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.920
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

314
00:33:50.790 --> 00:34:04.680
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I mean it is a big part that is missing. Um, but, again, going back to what we talked about it. I think it's, you know, working through your own grief and loss and in

315
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.750
Richelle Direny: After your mom passed away. You never did to have grief counseling. Did you

316
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:12.720
Jessica Adams: Know,

317
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:21.660
Jessica Adams: Yeah, they offer it up here at the hospital, though, and I just live right up the road from the hospital.

318
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.750
Richelle Direny: Okay so ever. You ever thought about going to one of the sessions.

319
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.740
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

320
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:36.270
Richelle Direny: I mean, I would encourage you to go to one of the session

321
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.790
Richelle Direny: The grief counseling, because I think it will just kind of help you

322
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:47.640
Richelle Direny: You know, even as you're getting ready because if your dad is seeing like towards the summer.

323
00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.970
Richelle Direny: He wants to do a little memorial for

324
00:34:53.070 --> 00:35:05.970
Richelle Direny: That will help you leading up to that moment just kind of process those feelings that you still have, you know, that sense of loss and like you said it was kind of she was like the glue that held the family together but grant

325
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:27.060
Richelle Direny: Was the, the blue based on what you shared there is some distortion invented glue where there were things that was happening within that family that was breaking the family apart. And so through that it started relationship. I mean, it's still function.

326
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:27.750
Right.

327
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:35.220
Richelle Direny: Talks about still having some degree of resentment towards your mom, even as it's related to your brother and

328
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:38.970
Richelle Direny: So,

329
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.260
Jessica Adams: It is like right

330
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:48.180
Richelle Direny: You know, it's kind of like trying to pick all of that apart because it was it was a distorted relationship based on what you share

331
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.300
Jessica Adams: Right.

332
00:35:51.750 --> 00:36:00.570
Richelle Direny: But then you're still saying that morning. It's still function. So the question is, how long has this been a relationship been distorted and

333
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:18.240
Richelle Direny: At what point did some part of you came into acceptance of what was going on in the family, even though you knew it was wrong, you still just came to acceptance and just somewhat started depending on her emotionally

334
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.690
Jessica Adams: Right.

335
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.380
Jessica Adams: I mean, I could tell if the end that you know she wasn't doing good, and saw it. I mean,

336
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.190
Jessica Adams: I tried to accept it, but I couldn't eat down because I do that that was

337
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.680
It.

338
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.490
Jessica Adams: No, no, I just

339
00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:05.100
Jessica Adams: You know, I wake up to go to color every morning. She's up there I go to tell her. Good night. She's out there you know what me and my dad barely is

340
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:25.860
Jessica Adams: I texted, or his birthday. Happy birthday, I call it that way. That birthday, and he's like, oh, okay. I think I call you back, and he never probably that that might

341
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:33.270
Richelle Direny: So you have certain expectations for each member of your family.

342
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:35.790
Jessica Adams: Right.

343
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.810
Richelle Direny: You're in an expectation sometimes can

344
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.020
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of put us in

345
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.670
Richelle Direny: This

346
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.090
Richelle Direny: Emotional downward spiral because we expect

347
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.730
Jessica Adams: Our way respond to us a certain way.

348
00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:09.570
Richelle Direny: We expect them to meet particular needs or we expected them to even know that you don't emotionally and destroy emotionally. I'm not in a good place. Mentally another place and you want them to meet that need. And that's kind of what you're doing with your dad.

349
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.670
Richelle Direny: While he has his

350
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:20.550
Richelle Direny: Own things going on, emotionally and mentally you expect him to meet those needs for you, but he's in a different place.

351
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:31.050
Richelle Direny: So, and I think that the having a session with him. I think will be beneficial because then you could hear what he's thinking and feeling

352
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.500
Jessica Adams: Right.

353
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.140
Jessica Adams: Okay.

354
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.410
Richelle Direny: Because when you when you, when we have these expectations that we create in our minds.

355
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.120
Richelle Direny: Um, you also put time limit on them.

356
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:50.760
Jessica Adams: Right.

357
00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:54.720
Jessica Adams: Right, yeah.

358
00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:08.610
Richelle Direny: And so, okay, I expect my dad to understand that you know I would. I want to be more involved in his life. I want to be involved in everything that's going on.

359
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:21.420
Richelle Direny: And I'm going to give him X amount of time and when he doesn't meet those needs needs that he didn't know or those expectations that he didn't know he had to meet or what he had to do then for you.

360
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:21.780
Jessica Adams: Your

361
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:26.040
Richelle Direny: Family and mentally destruct because he didn't meet these

362
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.000
Richelle Direny: Expectations are these requirements that you need.

363
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.510
Jessica Adams: Them to work.

364
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.250
Right.

365
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.660
Jessica Adams: Right, yeah.

366
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.550
Jessica Adams: I mean I guess I understand their

367
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:49.080
Richelle Direny: Look for more from your dad. I mean, I think that there's some degree of it that you seek out from your son, but I think

368
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:52.920
Richelle Direny: I think you know more

369
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:53.760
Jessica Adams: Right.

370
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.320
Richelle Direny: Out of it on your dad and your son because you fear losing the relationship with your son.

371
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.810
Jessica Adams: Right. Oh yeah, definitely.

372
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:13.170
Jessica Adams: I mean, I mean, we get along better now than we have ever before.

373
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.200
Jessica Adams: And you want it. You know, I hope team.

374
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.310
Jessica Adams: I mean, you know, yeah, I don't want anything jeopardizing that

375
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:34.080
Richelle Direny: So you feel more comfortable, kind of going head to head with your dad you feel more comfortable because

376
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:43.410
Richelle Direny: You feel like you know what he's obligated to some degree. So you don't feel like you're going to ruin it or you're going to jeopardize you just I think because of

377
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:52.590
Richelle Direny: The up and down that you guys have had in the relationship you know he'll be mad with you today. But then he'll be fine tomorrow. And then he'll come back around.

378
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.120
Jessica Adams: Right.

379
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:56.460
Jessica Adams: It then based on the

380
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.230
Richelle Direny: High

381
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:07.530
Jessica Adams: One was mad at me, you know, for most before you know and i just i get that killed me. You know what I mean. Exactly.

382
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:15.360
Richelle Direny: And I think it has more of an impact on you when your son does it to you in comparisons. If your dad does it to you.

383
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.300
Jessica Adams: Right.

384
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:22.950
Jessica Adams: Sure, yeah.

385
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:25.830
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

386
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:32.640
Richelle Direny: You see, psychologically, we put different labels and we have certain expectations of different people.

387
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:34.770
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

388
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:36.360
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

389
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.290
Richelle Direny: So you so somehow

390
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:53.310
Richelle Direny: Yeah point in life you categorize the everyone in your life and everyone in you you expert you expected, everyone in your life that you categorize they have certain responsibilities.

391
00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:00.780
Richelle Direny: That you've put on them that they didn't know they had. And so each time that each of them fail to meet those

392
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.170
Name.

393
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.050
Richelle Direny: It puts you in more of a mental mental fatigue.

394
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.660
Richelle Direny: Ultimately, put you in mentor.

395
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.380
Jessica Adams: I yeah

396
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.980
Jessica Adams: Definitely

397
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.200
Richelle Direny: Go ahead and

398
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:17.100
Jessica Adams: Type in there.

399
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.190
Jessica Adams: I said, I've already been there.

400
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.150
Richelle Direny: So you see how emotions trigger a thought that triggers or behavior.

401
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.100
Jessica Adams: Yeah, oh yeah yeah but Italy.

402
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.650
Jessica Adams: Me, you know,

403
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.400
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

404
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.600
Jessica Adams: Every song is even told me you know

405
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.090
Jessica Adams: That first is

406
00:42:50.010 --> 00:43:03.990
Jessica Adams: That he's had you know and like he doesn't, you know, feel like I was gonna be anything that I would ever remember being abandoned him ever again.

407
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:12.030
Jessica Adams: Because I, I've got my, you know, I'm working on me and doing what I need to do. I hope have

408
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.340
Jessica Adams: You know, so he sees me a try.

409
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:34.350
Jessica Adams: And it makes him happy. I mean, it makes his girlfriend. Happy to even though you know there was a part incident that we had

410
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:48.420
Jessica Adams: But I mean, I'm gonna have to learn to get along with her, or at least respect my son's wishes, if they if they want to be together.

411
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.480
Richelle Direny: But then, do you see how much of yourself.

412
00:43:52.830 --> 00:44:03.990
Richelle Direny: And whatever as moral values you have for yourself and whatever standards, you have whatever little centers, you have for yourself. Do you see how you're willing to forgo all of that, just to make him happy.

413
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:06.540
Jessica Adams: Yeah.

414
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.250
Richelle Direny: But do you notice how

415
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.540
Jessica Adams: Unhappy we

416
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.740
Richelle Direny: Are in doing that.

417
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.480
Jessica Adams: Excuse me.

418
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.240
Richelle Direny: Notice how unhappy.

419
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:30.540
Richelle Direny: I said, I'll do you notice how unhappy. You're really truly making yourself, just to make him happy because the end there's nothing, there's nothing really that you can do to ever really pleased him. How did your son.

420
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.220
Jessica Adams: Just turned 18

421
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:43.770
Richelle Direny: Okay, he's. I mean, he's at that stage, there's nothing that you're ever going to do to please him kids at that age. THEY WANT WANT WANT WANT WANT WANT WANT.

422
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:51.030
Richelle Direny: They don't really care about anybody else but themselves. They're, they're naturally selfish beings, everything is all about me. The world is

423
00:44:51.630 --> 00:45:01.050
Richelle Direny: Me and I figured out everything. And so when to play into that. I mean, it's not really doing any good. He will come around to

424
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.070
Jessica Adams: Our end

425
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.750
Richelle Direny: That you know life is not how he's created his mind.

426
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:08.730
Jessica Adams: Right.

427
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.680
Jessica Adams: Oh, yeah.

428
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:13.950
Richelle Direny: So,

429
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.520
Jessica Adams: Yeah, that's why I kind of figured because, I mean,

430
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.230
Jessica Adams: You know, he was like, I mean,

431
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.250
Jessica Adams: It's always monkey. Take me to the store monkey.

432
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:36.450
Jessica Adams: Monkey. And you know, I, I've been told, You know, I put my foot down on something, you know, in

433
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:49.440
Richelle Direny: But because he knows his happiness is your ultimate priority as children again, they're very selfish individuals by nature. They're very

434
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.640
Jessica Adams: Say, not to teach them to be unselfish and to be kind.

435
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.770
Richelle Direny: Granted, he has

436
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.540
Richelle Direny: Ever

437
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:10.260
Richelle Direny: Because he knows that his happiness is your number one priority. And you will do anything to make him happy. He's also going to play up on your emotions.

438
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.050
Jessica Adams: Right.

439
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.540
Jessica Adams: Okay, yeah, make sense.

440
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:34.380
Richelle Direny: He's not always play upon your emotion. So when you want to put your foot down and you think in the moment you are. He knows that that's not going to last because he knows you're you're here. Happiness is your number one priority.

441
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.540
Jessica Adams: Right.

442
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.720
