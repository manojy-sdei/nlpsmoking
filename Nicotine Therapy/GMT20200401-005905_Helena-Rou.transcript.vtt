00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.170
Helena Rouhe: Hello.

2
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.000
Helena Rouhe: Hi, how are you

3
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.010
Brian Riley: I'm good.

4
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.160
Brian Riley: How are you

5
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.650
Helena Rouhe: I am good.

6
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.280
Brian Riley: The day just kind of turned into like

7
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.500
Brian Riley: eggs. Eggs.

8
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.800
Eggs.

9
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.670
Brian Riley: Turned into a quest.

10
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.490
Brian Riley: So I just ran on

11
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.100
Brian Riley: Okay.

12
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.110
Brian Riley: I'm just kind of sit

13
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.770
Brian Riley: In a remote area. Okay.

14
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.800
Brian Riley: I was glad to see that.

15
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.100
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

16
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.580
Brian Riley: There's no particular really

17
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.170
Brian Riley: Back to back the way I'm seeing

18
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.430
Brian Riley: More of a feather lately, you know,

19
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.530
Brian Riley: There's

20
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.990
Brian Riley: Definitely feeling the impact of the absence

21
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.000
Brian Riley: I mean, it's getting

22
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.500
Brian Riley: too windy.

23
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.770
Helena Rouhe: No, it's okay, it's just saying

24
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.480
Brian Riley: I kind of giggle because there are times when I'm outside at the barn and if I'm by the horses.

25
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.700
Brian Riley: windblown things

26
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.900
Brian Riley: We are risky.

27
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.240
Brian Riley: I don't know where the microphone.

28
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.760
Helena Rouhe: It is right next to, well, I'm just looking at your headphones.

29
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.000
So,

30
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.130
Helena Rouhe: Like a little button where you can change the volume. So it would

31
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.610
Be

32
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.610
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

33
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.390
Helena Rouhe: So then it's probably

34
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.460
Brian Riley: In one sense.

35
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.410
Helena Rouhe: So unless you cut your ears.

36
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.450
Brian Riley: Yeah, just pretty well.

37
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.550
Brian Riley: I mean,

38
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.030
Brian Riley: I can, I can survive that. But yeah.

39
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.330
Yeah.

40
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:52.830
Brian Riley: So I don't know where, where do we start there's, it's been so weird, like every day is its own thing and it is totally like

41
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.320
Brian Riley: I, you know, a reoccurring feeling of

42
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.090
Brian Riley: Horror, you know, like, Yeah, and it's it's all news related and and

43
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.360
Brian Riley: It's a very, very fucking strange experience. I don't know if it's because I have that

44
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:22.260
Brian Riley: That cinema background, you know, but when I'm in the car and I'm driving and I hear those newscasts

45
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.250
Brian Riley: It's surreal.

46
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:38.880
Brian Riley: You know, and they're just getting fucking crazier like the one that I heard was like topped it all, like, an hour ago, and I just don't know what to do it.

47
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:53.040
Brian Riley: And I guess I'm just like out to something like that, you know, he's talking about the next two weeks being really fucking crazy and hard and like all these people dying and shit and

48
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.410
Brian Riley: And the

49
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.250
Brian Riley: It's just, it's horrifying. Yeah.

50
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.260
Yeah.

51
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.900
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, I don't think

52
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.790
Brian Riley: At the same time, though, it's

53
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.110
Brian Riley: Good. I'm sorry. No, not necessarily. Go ahead. At the same time,

54
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.590
Brian Riley: Not the same time I'm like really, really good.

55
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.660
Helena Rouhe: Well,

56
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.440
Helena Rouhe: You know, like

57
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:31.980
Brian Riley: That like I'm adapting really fucking easily to it. Yeah, so much that I think that's what you need to focus on is focused on your own immediate well

58
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.520
Helena Rouhe: Being and are you able to kind of take care of your day to day

59
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.240
Helena Rouhe: Because that's what you have more control over.

60
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.860
Helena Rouhe: As much as we have control over anything that's going on right now. We have control over how we spend our time and how we spend our energy so

61
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:58.380
Helena Rouhe: We're all under very interesting constrictions for all sorts of reasons. And I think it's important to

62
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:09.540
Helena Rouhe: I don't want to advocate the people be ignorant to what's going on, and at the same time, if it's like you've acknowledged.

63
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.720
Helena Rouhe: It's

64
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:17.040
Helena Rouhe: It's too. It's very stressful. So it becomes too stressful, which is up to you to figure out what that means.

65
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.700
Brian Riley: Then

66
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.560
Helena Rouhe: You need to maybe take a break from the news and at the same time, I don't want to advocate.

67
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:33.600
Helena Rouhe: For you to be, you know, ignorant and not be aware of what's going on and and so it was it and it's going to change so much is going on in such short periods of time that it is

68
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:45.240
Helena Rouhe: Hard to kind of mitigate that or manage that and there. It's so much of it is unknown, and I think the reason why we're all spooked is that we've all seen these kind of

69
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:58.350
Helena Rouhe: A lack for a better word apocalyptic kind of zombie weird movies where you you get a little bit almost desensitized to it because it's it's that it's, you know, that's a

70
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:08.430
Helena Rouhe: That's another world. That's something else that's movie. And now, on some level, it feels a little bit like we've entered that you know i mean that that makes sense. But I think we

71
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:19.320
Helena Rouhe: Human beings we try and make sense of things right. That is our way of surviving something so our context in this world is to relate things to

72
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:30.450
Helena Rouhe: Cinema or stories that we've heard you and I are my movie buffs. So we're probably going to go to movies and things that we've seen a little bit quicker than say somebody else who's maybe

73
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.650
Helena Rouhe: A book buff and they're going to go to certain books or certain stories or, you know, so we're all going to, but we all have to find some

74
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.860
Helena Rouhe: Up and before this makes sense in this context, and this is

75
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:56.400
Helena Rouhe: Unique to the world. I mean, this is not ever happened world history where we've all been so connected via the internet and social media to know what is going on in real time around the world.

76
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:05.850
Helena Rouhe: And within our own country and it is affecting everyone. This is a global pin. This is a global situation. And so it is

77
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.030
Helena Rouhe: It is a surreal time it is unique and there is nothing really to compare it to. So then what

78
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:25.530
Helena Rouhe: Well, if you don't have anything to compare it to. That's going to create too much stress. So we have to find something to make sense of it in order to kind of manage the anxiety of it. If it's too alien

79
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.740
Helena Rouhe: It's, you know, those are the kinds of moments where people can really just kind of check out, they just

80
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:41.730
Helena Rouhe: So you have. So we all as a way to kind of manage this like, what is going on. We have to find something to connect it to so that we can

81
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:54.420
Helena Rouhe: Try and rationalize our way through it mean so for somebody who's a proper well this is something I need to prep for so then they just prep right so I'm in a prep, or I'm going to go to my thing or whatever, you know,

82
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.760
Helena Rouhe: Everyone's going to have their ways of managing it. And I think that's

83
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:09.930
Helena Rouhe: Another piece of it which we talked about last night in group is just one way. That's really important for everyone, regardless of who you are and how you do things is to keep some sort of a routine.

84
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:18.030
Helena Rouhe: And and really keep that and make sure that that routine is working for you and it's not an unhealthy routine.

85
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.160
Helena Rouhe: But a routine. That's important to

86
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.450
Helena Rouhe: You yeah and

87
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.260
Brian Riley: So it's

88
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.280
Helena Rouhe: Really important.

89
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.000
Yeah.

90
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.780
Brian Riley: I stayed up willingly till three last night finishing my list.

91
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:43.260
Brian Riley: And it wasn't, it wasn't because I had too much, just to kind of day, that it was it just ran out of time for this or that or whatever. And I could have easily left it.

92
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.140
Brian Riley: Without issue and

93
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.810
Brian Riley: I said, no, you know, it's no

94
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.520
Brian Riley: No, I said that I'm going to do every day. So like

95
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.660
Brian Riley: What's on my board is I'll tell you, extra

96
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.240
Brian Riley: It's a whatever poem illustrated home I'm working on.

97
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:19.080
Brian Riley: Is a half hour that during the day and then after that is the another project I'm working on exploring, whatever. And that's about a half hour that

98
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:20.700
Brian Riley: And then

99
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.430
Brian Riley: Three illustrations

100
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.490
Brian Riley: Of whatever body.

101
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.340
Brian Riley: Administrative which is

102
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.850
Brian Riley: Or my organizer and like

103
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:44.820
Brian Riley: Making a call and a fellow or make or whatever, you know, for me, I do that for 20 minutes and then the other side I have home.

104
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.460
Brian Riley: So it does like hang a picture or vacuum or put the dishes something

105
00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:01.470
Brian Riley: Yard, which is nothing crazy, but just like mow the lawn or trim, you know, the bush or like whatever

106
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.660
Brian Riley: Hey,

107
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.780
Brian Riley: I'm Esther.

108
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.160
Brian Riley: Which is anything like watching a movie together or getting her rose or whatever, like that.

109
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:24.060
Brian Riley: Space, which is my studio space sweep the floor fucking something, whatever.

110
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.020
Okay.

111
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.600
Brian Riley: Close either wash or fall or whatever.

112
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:32.730
Brian Riley: Like that.

113
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.010
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

114
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.790
Brian Riley: You know, it's not

115
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.440
Brian Riley: Yeah, because it's like, I remember my I was staying with my grandmother and her final year

116
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:56.070
Brian Riley: She caught me just like watching TV, one day, everything was fine her house, you know,

117
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.560
Brian Riley: And

118
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.680
Brian Riley: She said, what are you doing everything is going to fall apart.

119
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.360
Brian Riley: It was like insane but it, get it, you know.

120
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.620
Brian Riley: Like, just gotta shift going kind of tight, I guess.

121
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.930
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean, maybe not tight, but in a positive way.

122
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.710
Right, right.

123
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.040
Helena Rouhe: Keep it organized, because that's what keeps

124
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.810
Helena Rouhe: Us mentally organized so it is

125
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.300
Helena Rouhe: You know you can relate

126
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.870
Helena Rouhe: To this

127
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:28.770
Helena Rouhe: But

128
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.780
Helena Rouhe: When people are disorganized.

129
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.710
Helena Rouhe: And they have

130
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.760
Helena Rouhe: Too much stuff.

131
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.470
Helena Rouhe: Or clutter, things are out of control, like your mom and the whole hoarding situation.

132
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:49.800
Helena Rouhe: Then that feels like a reflection of what's going on internally and probably in some ways is so when you externally can manage life internally life becomes more manageable.

133
00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:06.360
Helena Rouhe: And that's why routine is so important. It is important to externally kind of manage different because internally, we're all trying to, you know, figure out what's going on here. And in some ways, probably feel a little bit zombie like ourselves, just like what

134
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:08.910
Brian Riley: Yeah, because

135
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.540
Helena Rouhe: I mean to act like everything is fine is a bit

136
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.110
Brian Riley: You know, you really can't. You can't can't

137
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:24.480
Helena Rouhe: I mean, it's a life is Ignorance. Ignorance is bliss. But, I mean, that's, that's, you're gonna have to work hard to be that ignorant at this point.

138
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:25.800
Yeah.

139
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.280
Brian Riley: Yeah, it helps to talk about. So, um, check this out.

140
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.000
Brian Riley: This I I was

141
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.460
Brian Riley: beside myself with fury.

142
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.790
Brian Riley: I couldn't. I could not get out of it all day. What happened, I

143
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.340
Brian Riley: I took Dr. Waters prescription to Safeway. Mm hmm.

144
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.870
Brian Riley: It was ready for the 28th.

145
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.810
Brian Riley: And I knew that the 29th would be okay to fill

146
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.540
Brian Riley: So the regular pharmacist wasn't there was another pharmacist.

147
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.680
Brian Riley: And she didn't know me.

148
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.650
Brian Riley: And

149
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.460
Brian Riley: The way. Dr. Waters wrote

150
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.980
Brian Riley: The 28

151
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.290
Brian Riley: She kind of wrote it twice. So it was a little bold.

152
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.390
Brian Riley: Okay.

153
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.930
Brian Riley: Obviously not altered, but it just stood out

154
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.520
Brian Riley: The pharmacist.

155
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.830
Brian Riley: accused me of altering the script.

156
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.050
Brian Riley: And would not deal with me. She turned me away.

157
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.420
Brian Riley: I'm over it now.

158
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.530
Brian Riley: It was

159
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.850
Brian Riley: Everything that thing that bothers me about being treated that way. Yeah.

160
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.990
Brian Riley: And as the day went on, I realized, more and more about the situation.

161
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.760
Brian Riley: And how fucking wrong, it was

162
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:42.750
Brian Riley: Like, I'm a customer for years. She did not even think to look anything up.

163
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.950
Brian Riley: She treated it like a bomb.

164
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.800
Brian Riley: I was so fucking pissed off.

165
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.170
Brian Riley: A cause the problem with Esther.

166
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.530
Brian Riley: Because when I'm in a bad mood or whatever the fuck and I wasn't like

167
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.600
Brian Riley: But I mean, I had to let it out. You know, I, even I, I, I

168
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.170
Brian Riley: I sent an email to Dr. Waters.

169
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.190
Brian Riley: It was crazy.

170
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.410
Brian Riley: And then

171
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.330
Brian Riley: I debated today on how to handle it with the regular pharmacist yesterday.

172
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.530
Brian Riley: And I didn't say anything. And I just went in and I handed it to her and she had it done in 30 minutes

173
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.810
Brian Riley: And I gave her a thank you

174
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:45.900
Helena Rouhe: So,

175
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.060
Helena Rouhe: He didn't let her know about the other time.

176
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:56.460
Brian Riley: There have been so many issues, but this fucking safely that after the last time I threatened to never come back.

177
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:05.940
Brian Riley: Oh, and I have. So I just don't want to be that guy. It's like after so many times, who was me as them and

178
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.410
Brian Riley: You know, I'm sure she stands by your pharmacists yesterday. Right, so I didn't, I didn't say

179
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.860
Brian Riley: I opted. I just wanted to let it go and

180
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.820
Brian Riley: I'm gonna I'm gonna find out the pharmacist named I'm going to write a letter to central office.

181
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.650
Helena Rouhe: Okay, good. Yeah.

182
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.330
Brian Riley: About it.

183
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.640
Brian Riley: Because it was pretty fucking

184
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.680
Brian Riley: I mean she accused me of being a criminal.

185
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.150
Brian Riley: Yeah.

186
00:19:45.240 --> 00:20:00.210
Helena Rouhe: I mean yeah and and it's just ridiculous. I mean, now more than ever, it's important to be empathetic and understanding and look at things and really pay attention not be flippant dismissive and ridiculous. I mean, just

187
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.390
Helena Rouhe: But

188
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.490
Brian Riley: I was talking so crazy.

189
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:15.570
Helena Rouhe: Not to defend her. But this is another stress reaction, right. So either we as human beings really slow down and pay

190
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.460
Helena Rouhe: Attention to what's going on and are

191
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:25.020
Helena Rouhe: More conscientious or we're stressed out were rushed and we're flippant and

192
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.980
Helena Rouhe: How intentional that flippancy is

193
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:41.820
Helena Rouhe: We can't speak to her program, right, we're not going to work. Her side of the street, but at the same time, it's not to say that it wasn't hurtful and that it's completely understandable that you would have

194
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:55.500
Helena Rouhe: Be upset by it. I, but if we're going to try and kind of reconcile it to your point, let it go. That's a way to do that. I mean, in everybody is stressed out, that is 100% safe.

195
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.290
Helena Rouhe: statement to make. Right. Not that it took

196
00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.040
Brian Riley: My sponsor.

197
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.750
Brian Riley: So my sponsor said that. Yeah.

198
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.470
Okay.

199
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:10.800
Brian Riley: He's. He said, You don't know what he said. Think of it like this, she's waiting to get covert 19

200
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.000
Brian Riley: And

201
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.810
Brian Riley: Give her the gift of grace, just forgive her for

202
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.050
Brian Riley: She's on the front lines of

203
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.200
Brian Riley: You know, and I didn't realize it was nothing personal.

204
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.350
Brian Riley: But

205
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:40.950
Brian Riley: That doesn't excuse it, actually, you know, she's accepting professional five says, are you kidding me, you know, like

206
00:21:42.120 --> 00:22:00.750
Brian Riley: You wouldn't look at me, look at my account and just see like what is what. Or I mean I know how it works. You either hold the prescription you hold the prescription and do your checking to do over the phone or

207
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.230
Brian Riley: If you don't, you know, it's like there are so many other things to do before.

208
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.940
Brian Riley: dismissing me from the counter. Mm hmm.

209
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.480
Brian Riley: And then Esther was saying.

210
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.210
Brian Riley: Because I knew

211
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.030
Brian Riley: That it wasn't just a bowl 20

212
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.640
Brian Riley: It was my parents.

213
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.610
Brian Riley: And it was me. It was my goatee and my ponytail.

214
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.210
Brian Riley: And I look like a drug addict.

215
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.910
Helena Rouhe: Why do you say that

216
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.920
Helena Rouhe: And when does that mean

217
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:18.240
Brian Riley: I mean, I don't know. But let's say you know you line up 10 people 10 types that are going to be at the pharmacy with a big prescription. I look like

218
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.870
Brian Riley: I look like I get it, you know, and

219
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.850
Brian Riley: Oh,

220
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.250
Helena Rouhe: Hold on. So let's take a breath there. So you have acknowledged a concern.

221
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.870
Helena Rouhe: Not too long ago about how

222
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.490
Brian Riley: People may personally tell you

223
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:43.440
Helena Rouhe: Based on your appearance and that you made an effort to think about your clothing and kind of reconcile

224
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:54.030
Helena Rouhe: Being able to be a great spirit and be who you are. Okay, so were you kind of rolling in a little old school. The, the day went into the pharmacy. Okay, so

225
00:23:54.810 --> 00:24:05.100
Helena Rouhe: Your core. So a core pain is not being recognized for who you are and people having perceptions of universes, who you think you are right. Well, you know, you are

226
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:15.060
Helena Rouhe: And being in that situation kind of registered that core pain, even though you weren't actually externally. I mean,

227
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.700
Helena Rouhe: You're in California for crying out loud. It's not like you're in. I don't even know where to come up with

228
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.660
Helena Rouhe: Somewhere like

229
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.000
Brian Riley: I don't even know.

230
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.630
Brian Riley: Different though Brentwood is different. Right. Okay. Yeah.

231
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.100
Helena Rouhe: Well,

232
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.860
Helena Rouhe: I still feel like, oh, this. This prompted

233
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.480
Brian Riley: This prompted Esther.

234
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.370
Brian Riley: To say

235
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.030
Brian Riley: And this is her problem.

236
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.700
Brian Riley: She's young she's getting over much better, but she's still will never

237
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.530
Brian Riley: Fully

238
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.350
Brian Riley: Not

239
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:58.470
Brian Riley: Be conforming her solution.

240
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.130
Brian Riley: Was for me to look at myself.

241
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.400
Brian Riley: And find

242
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.940
Brian Riley: A closer

243
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:17.610
Brian Riley: Estimate

244
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.560
Brian Riley: To normal

245
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:21.900
Brian Riley: Whatever that

246
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.890
Helena Rouhe: And that's her issue. What does that mean by that.

247
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:36.480
Helena Rouhe: What do you mean by saying that that's her issues is something you guys have identified in couples therapy and that you're kind of talking about that and

248
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.000
Brian Riley: Discussing that or yeah we're gonna

249
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:39.960
Brian Riley: We're gonna lead

250
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:47.250
Brian Riley: Sheet. I mean, that was a big thing with her and the ex husband and she admitted herself that

251
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.750
Brian Riley: She is one to try to

252
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.980
Brian Riley: Fit in rather than

253
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:57.990
Brian Riley: Stand down

254
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:11.250
Helena Rouhe: Well, if it was really that important to her. Then she would have connected to somebody who is very for lack of a better word, milk, toasty and blending into the environment and if she really cared about that.

255
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.030
Helena Rouhe: That's what she would have she did not pick somebody like that so

256
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.080
Brian Riley: Something I know, I know.

257
00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.350
Helena Rouhe: really likes the that you are unique and

258
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.660
Brian Riley: Individually to do all that. So,

259
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:36.720
Helena Rouhe: She. So in that sense, I would agree with you. She asked to reconcile what she says versus where she how she acts right that she acted in a way that says I like individual I like somebody who's kind of kind of ball.

260
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.830
Brian Riley: Against the system.

261
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:44.310
Helena Rouhe: All of that. So, but that's her work to do so in the meantime, going back to you and your concern.

262
00:26:46.680 --> 00:27:07.770
Helena Rouhe: It sounds like already being stressed, as we all are to be in a situation where you feel dismissed kind of really took you right back to this core fear of being poorly perceived or not understood judged dismissed all that negative stuff, you know,

263
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.890
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and that's a place you

264
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.090
Helena Rouhe: Get

265
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.790
Helena Rouhe: Well, that's a place you go when you get super worried and stress and

266
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.910
Helena Rouhe: And so it is important for you right now. It's important for all of us, but it's important for you right now that

267
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:35.760
Helena Rouhe: Under this stress that all of us face our face that you take extra time and care to take care of yourself because you are more vulnerable.

268
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:50.280
Helena Rouhe: And this is a good example of that. It doesn't dismiss what you know I don't. It doesn't dismiss that person's behavior. Certainly not. But you are more vulnerable to things like that, then you would be

269
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.210
Under different, sir.

270
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.020
Brian Riley: I realize

271
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.860
Brian Riley: That I am

272
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.990
Brian Riley: Continually I'm actually concerned that I'm not right now.

273
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.500
Brian Riley: I'm continuing I'm out in the world. If I'm not walking the dog.

274
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.080
Brian Riley: I'm continually waiting

275
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.430
Brian Riley: To be confronted and questioned.

276
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.800
Brian Riley: And

277
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.490
Brian Riley: interrogated.

278
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.040
Brian Riley: Constant.

279
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.570
Brian Riley: Stop, I'm waiting to be stopped and question.

280
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:10.320
Helena Rouhe: Is that because of the circumstances of the world with things feeling very stressful. And so you just don't know or that's this was happening before all of this other stuff was going on.

281
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.510
Helena Rouhe: Has that been since

282
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.560
Helena Rouhe: You had the arrest. We're not the rest. But they're running with the

283
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:25.890
Brian Riley: Doc or not the dark. Yeah, I told you about there. Yeah, there was a stretch, there were, there was a security guard.

284
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:42.240
Brian Riley: There's like the stress of like all these fucking authority figures and that was really where, as you know, that's the time she said, you know, tell me what the difference is between you and the guy on the corner.

285
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.470
Brian Riley: In your parents like what is the difference, she said.

286
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.290
Brian Riley: And at that point, that's when I decided to turn dress up

287
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.150
Brian Riley: And

288
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.820
Brian Riley: But still I wait

289
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.040
Brian Riley: And I just, I always make sure I know where I'm going.

290
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.480
Brian Riley: I know where I'm going. And what I'm doing.

291
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.870
Brian Riley: And what I'm going to say when I'm asked

292
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.860
Brian Riley: I always make sure i know i just i know

293
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.480
Brian Riley: And I mean, it's good thing. It's good to do

294
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.590
Brian Riley: But I have to, I find myself telling myself.

295
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.990
Brian Riley: I can walk by myself without a dog.

296
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.750
Brian Riley: And right I could do

297
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.730
Brian Riley: Because that's what I'm going to say if I need to.

298
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.000
Brian Riley: But there's going to be times where

299
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.920
Brian Riley: I'm going to be making a metal thing.

300
00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:04.110
Brian Riley: And I'm going to have to say I'm an artist and I pick things up from the ground.

301
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.600
Brian Riley: And I build things with them.

302
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.870
Brian Riley: You know and I imagine that will be okay you know

303
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:30.690
Brian Riley: I mean, these are things that I'm not gonna stop to it. Mm hmm. You know, and that's why if I got a dress wear a nicer shirt to do that if I'm going to be, you know, like if I if I'm going to be a century.

304
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:38.850
Brian Riley: I, chances are, I'm going to raise eyebrows and I'm going to have a couple over that and

305
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.610
Brian Riley: Where are you going with that metal rock.

306
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:46.710
You know,

307
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.450
Brian Riley: What's your address.

308
00:31:53.430 --> 00:32:07.500
Helena Rouhe: Do you have like a bag or something like a little canvas bag or something that you can stick stuff in. So it doesn't look like you're just walking along the street with a metal rod or some other kind of random potential weapon.

309
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.980
Brian Riley: If you

310
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.390
Helena Rouhe: Will I mean if you're concerned.

311
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.740
Brian Riley: About, you know, perceiving I

312
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.440
Brian Riley: Make sure I make sure it never looked like I'd be like,

313
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.250
Brian Riley: Okay, I'm not that

314
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.020
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean,

315
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:28.890
Helena Rouhe: I think it's it's you're recognizing things and and yet I don't want you to spend your life worrying about what everybody perceives, and at the same time, I think right now.

316
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:39.210
Helena Rouhe: All recognize it. It's been longer than this, but I think right now it's it's coming potentially coming up for you. More given the circumstances. I mean, everybody's on edge.

317
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:51.600
Helena Rouhe: Things are more stressful. And so it would be understandable if you're feeling a little bit more defensive, a little bit more anxious about perception right now.

318
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:58.710
Brian Riley: Yeah, yeah. And it's, I tell you what, it's really I'm getting I'm getting more used to it.

319
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.640
Brian Riley: But it was really bringing up a lot of old stuff when

320
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.810
Brian Riley: People were

321
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:21.810
Brian Riley: Waiting for me to pass or keeping their distance from me it like it really helps to have the markers at the store now and stuff because like

322
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:31.680
Brian Riley: Prior to that, when people were doing it. It was bringing up on old stuff, you know, it's like that's what everybody has to do now and it but it took me a while to

323
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:38.040
Brian Riley: Drop the old feelings of they're keeping their distance from nothing.

324
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.380
Brian Riley: So,

325
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.670
Brian Riley: Now, I kind of dig it, I can. I like I like this.

326
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.970
Helena Rouhe: Well,

327
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.780
Helena Rouhe: It gives you permission to have space that you probably have always needed

328
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.040
Brian Riley: Yeah.

329
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:59.490
Helena Rouhe: But you needed it for different reasons before and now it's a now it's for healthy reasons. So, yeah.

330
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.980
Yeah.

331
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.230
Brian Riley: Okay.

332
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.320
Brian Riley: So,

333
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.300
Helena Rouhe: Brian, you are not crazy.

334
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.140
Brian Riley: You're

335
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.150
Helena Rouhe: A terrible human being.

336
00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.150
Helena Rouhe: I know you are really doing good work.

337
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.560
Helena Rouhe: It's a very stressful.

338
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.060
Helena Rouhe: Time and I

339
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.850
Helena Rouhe: Think it's important for you to acknowledge that, too.

340
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.440
Helena Rouhe: And it's understandable that it's

341
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.180
Helena Rouhe: Upsetting and stressful. Yeah.

342
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.820
Brian Riley: And yeah and so not really that

343
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.030
Brian Riley: I've i'm i'm surprised that I was just so emotional

344
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:38.490
Helena Rouhe: Well then, it's okay. And I think, go slow to go fast. You know, this is, I love that phrase. But I think there's these times, especially

345
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:51.750
Helena Rouhe: Give yourself a little more space. Give yourself a little bit more time because things are very stressful and even the person who's got the best coping skills on the planet is going to be like right now so

346
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:58.500
Helena Rouhe: Yes, you're doing great. It's it is going to bring up you know all this stuff, but I think

347
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:04.830
Helena Rouhe: There would have been a time not too long ago that this would have really shut you down and really given you, you would have been

348
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:15.210
Helena Rouhe: really struggling and I think that you're doing an amazing job. Given the circumstances or you're doing an amazing job period, especially given the circumstances so

349
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:19.890
Brian Riley: I understand what you're saying. Yeah. And I thought that's constant constantly think

350
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.150
Helena Rouhe: Okay, good.

351
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.770
Brian Riley: And yeah. Oh, good. I

352
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:33.000
Helena Rouhe: was just gonna say an animal. So reassuring. So it's understandable that you would feel a little more assured just having a dog with you. I mean, I would

353
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:38.430
Helena Rouhe: Walking down the street. These days, I would feel a little more comfortable with an animal versus not so

354
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.680
Brian Riley: Yeah yeah

355
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.680
Brian Riley: I got a spawn say

356
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.920
Helena Rouhe: You do. That's exciting.

357
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:57.780
Brian Riley: Yeah, my sponsor. Yeah, it was um can remember. I don't know if you heard last night. Like when I was saying my gratitude. I was saying. Like I had been secretly kind of really want one.

358
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.260
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

359
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.030
Brian Riley: I haven't, I haven't, you know, but as of late so helpful to be able to be able to someone, whatever.

360
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.170
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, I was hoping

361
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.510
Helena Rouhe: And wondering what that meant. That's exciting.

362
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.560
Brian Riley: Yeah, me too. And so then when I got home last night.

363
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:22.980
Brian Riley: I sponsor fucking called me and he said he's overloaded. He's got a couple guys coming back whatever he's got this new guy could he could he give him my number.

364
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.240
Brian Riley: Hey, can

365
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:46.080
Brian Riley: I said, I said, Yeah, definitely. So the guy called me right away and he met today at 430 I got him a little notebook and a pen and again assignments and he's like really excited. He's we're very similar. He's 45 the answer survivor and

366
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:57.540
Brian Riley: The crazy some of that, you know, and but perfect, you know, and he's he's been through a easily he's at that point where he just can't anymore. No.

367
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:05.280
Brian Riley: Yeah, and so we got together for like an hour and it changed my day.

368
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.480
Helena Rouhe: Yeah yeah

369
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:07.470
Brian Riley: I'm going to do.

370
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.420
Helena Rouhe: About it. You're all lit up about it. Now that's awesome very

371
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.740
Brian Riley: Very exciting.

372
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:23.400
Helena Rouhe: I think ton to be said for being of service to others, especially in times of stress. It really helps to kind of get out of your own head to be of service to somebody else in that moment.

373
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:31.320
Helena Rouhe: Not forever, but just even having that little break from your own nonsense really does make a huge difference in life. Good for you.

374
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:41.250
Brian Riley: Yep. Yep, good, good. Perfect timing awesome show that's I guess what I was saying it's like it's a really bad time. But it's also a good time.

375
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.360
Helena Rouhe: Well,

376
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.690
Helena Rouhe: And focus on the good. Will you survive the bad. I mean, I think.

377
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:59.970
Helena Rouhe: That's a another great kind of thing to remember because right now there's very little we can do about all this craziness. But what we can do is, is take extra time to make sure we take care of ourselves and the things that matter to us most

378
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.360
Brian Riley: Yeah yeah

379
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:07.860
Helena Rouhe: All right.

380
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.840
Brian Riley: So, yeah. So there it is.

381
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.030
Brian Riley: Hello.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.810

402
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.270
Brian Riley: But how much does fuckin Dr. PACHTER look like Rick from The Walking Dead.

403
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.540
Brian Riley: I mean, it's a fucking Spitting image.

404
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.090
Helena Rouhe: I had to kind of pull up both images in my

405
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.070
Helena Rouhe: Mind, put them side by side.

406
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:56.850
Helena Rouhe: Just

407
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.420
Helena Rouhe: Put it in my mind, but I think you think that's hilarious.

408
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.100
Brian Riley: shows me last night he had

409
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:09.600
Helena Rouhe: Last night, I can see where you would say that because he didn't have a little bit more of a fluffy here thing going. So

410
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.000
Helena Rouhe: That's funny.

411
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:16.650
Brian Riley: What time

412
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.070
Helena Rouhe: Well,

413
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:22.350
Helena Rouhe: It's the small things right. Keep us giggling. We have to find ways to giggle at all this craziness.

414
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.670
Brian Riley: All look, look.

415
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.570
Brian Riley: It's one of those drive by birthday parties. Oh.

416
00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.280
Brian Riley: Well, that's

417
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.270
Brian Riley: A Dr. Fail drive by kids birthdays.

418
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:47.760
Helena Rouhe: Oh I, you know, just this morning I was hearing about this whole drive by phenomenon. We're not really in a drive by environment, but I

419
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.230
Think that's fantastic.

420
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.920
Helena Rouhe: Great way to allow connection.

421
00:40:53.460 --> 00:41:05.910
Brian Riley: Yeah, and we're asterisk. I didn't know about this one. But, uh, I guess. Another thing is parents are driving their kids around to look for teddy bears and window.

422
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.360
Brian Riley: So I gotta go home. I'm gonna make a big teddy bear.

423
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.660
Brian Riley: Yeah, those are fun.

424
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.460
Helena Rouhe: There you go. I love it.

425
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.560
Helena Rouhe: I love that people are finding ways to

427
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.540
