Gwenevere Abriel: Is Gabriel, Laura.

2
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Check on audio and video, make sure we've got good Wi Fi.

3
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Connection. Hi.

4
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.420
Gabriel Lara: Let me grab a lamp real quick. It's a little

5
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You take your time. I've got to open a note anyway.

6
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.840
Okay.

7
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm opening up a note reviewing your goals while you're setting up

8
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And where am I finding you this morning hotel home out of town. Are you at your home.

9
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.490
Oh,

10
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.710
Gabriel Lara: Everyone that a

11
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.700
Gabriel Lara: Quarantine for lack of a better word.

12
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In their home with you though.

13
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.540
Gabriel Lara: My family. Yeah, yeah.

14
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

15
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all right. Um, thank you for checking in early that helped me sort of coordinate my day and see who's going to be here. Thank you for that.

16
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So it has been, I think, since about February 26 that we met. I think for individual I can double check. But bottom line. Let's take a peek at your goals. See how you assess how you're doing.

17
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a couple of primary goals which sort of are steering the substance use portion of our work together and you you phrase it. I want to eliminate my addiction to drugs and alcohol. Okay.

18
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like I wrote a little note.

19
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: February.

20
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well this one had to do it, attending group, which I think you've

21
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Attended consistently so

22
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: you're attending bi weekly at this point for weekly

23
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.640
Gabriel Lara: For

24
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.490
Gabriel Lara: group therapy group, a group of people

25
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.510
Okay.

26
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to take a look about in a minute. But what how many milligrams. Are you at currently with the buprenorphine.

27
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.350
Gabriel Lara: 168

28
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do not know the milligram translation of that.

29
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.460
Gabriel Lara: I don't know the chart in front of me. No, I didn't.

30
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me see if I can know really want to visit with strips is to come, located

31
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Rather go milligrams, because that's sort of a universal

32
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of

33
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Communication.

34
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Just organized myself.

35
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's harder to find.

36
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you know my desktop.

37
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And some I'll keep it on the ghost hope, frankly, okay, you said one and six, eight looks like 14 milligrams. He said, one in six eight

38
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll share that with you as you can kind of cross check

39
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you see it the same way.

40
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking right in here.

41
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Now these strips themselves are about the eight milligram strips.

42
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That right

43
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's like 14 milligrams right here.

44
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay cool 14 it is

45
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'll keep that up.

46
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty handy.

47
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.990
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, it looks like it's one milligram for

48
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds right. So it's an eight milligram

49
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense. So it looks like in January. There was a little note client open to take her into 15 and now you're 14, are you, are you happy with the rate that you're tapering is this acceptable.

50
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:27.930
Gabriel Lara: Yeah. Well, I started taking my medication differently. So they taking it at the same time every day before I will be talking about taking in the yard.

51
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.160
Yes.

52
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.450
Gabriel Lara: Now,

53
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.590
Gabriel Lara: I was Pacific time. Which reminds me to go take it.

54
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say here, and let's be really clear. Did the bottle ever say that

55
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

56
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:48.660
Gabriel Lara: But it didn't say anything. Not that whenever I had a craving that I should take it.

57
00:08:49.620 --> 00:09:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now you realize, and I know that was discussed in groups, but that's actually I'm self medicating and it mimics addictive behavior. The same way you may have reached for a short acting opiate so we want to extinguish that behavior. Now you have a new understanding of it.

58
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.320
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, yeah, we got a group

59
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Which are you taking it in the morning consistently makes a big difference.

60
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.280
Gabriel Lara: Well,

61
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.790
Gabriel Lara: It depends. Sometimes I wake up and take it like at eight in the morning, my body would wake me up on its own.

62
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:34.110
Gabriel Lara: Sometimes, oh, you know, wake up around 839 I'll take it. Then so around that time as well let me know that I would take it.

63
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Out an hour, hour and a half. That seems like a

64
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty consistent time and do you wake up in any any withdrawal symptoms even even minor ones.

65
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.430
Gabriel Lara: In the morning and you know as a for I get up in the morning.

66
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.530
Gabriel Lara: Normal so

67
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:05.520
Gabriel Lara: It just really, you know, I've kind of taken aback like my cup of coffee in the morning, kinda like to to go and you know just started for the day.

68
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed your body kind of bouncing up and down for you. This gives you energy

69
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.380
Gabriel Lara: Kelly gets me going. And gets my mind right

70
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.390
Gabriel Lara: In the right direction.

71
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it typically in the morning. What do you notice

72
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.330
Gabriel Lara: Just that I you know I tell myself. Okay, it's gonna be a good day.

73
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.240
Gabriel Lara: It gives me

74
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.130
Gabriel Lara: an optimistic outlook for today.

75
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You liken it much like to the coffee.

76
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.540
Gabriel Lara: Yeah yeah

77
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have not had it yet. This morning, or you have

78
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:03.630
Gabriel Lara: No, I haven't.

79
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.500
Gabriel Lara: Run and grab it real quick. That's okay.

80
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: As long as, are you able to talk a little while now. You know what I just saw something that's going to do a disservice.

81
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the doctor says, you might not be getting the full dose you're drinking coffee. Now that is going to mess with the absorption, you might want to tell your doctor that you're not gonna get the full dose.

82
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.090
Gabriel Lara: I haven't taken

83
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I don't. What did I just say

84
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.100
Gabriel Lara: That I'm that

85
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.320
Gabriel Lara: I'm not sure.

86
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I'm not sure why your response that's confusing.

87
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.030
Gabriel Lara: Well, because

88
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:51.960
Gabriel Lara: I actually like seven to the other room so I can take it. And you said no. And then you said, Wait, you're drinking coffee. You're not supposed to be drinking wine ticket.

89
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I

90
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:56.520
Gabriel Lara: Think

91
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I didn't say that it's recording. That's, that's what's nice about this. But let's start from scratch.

92
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm bringing this topic up. Did you hear me say I'm concerned, you're not getting the full dose. Did you hear that

93
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.090
Gabriel Lara: Yes.

94
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I do you know why.

95
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.000
Gabriel Lara: Because he said that I'm drinking coffee and taking it, but I haven't taken

96
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I didn't say that.

97
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.400
What

98
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't get to finish because you had interrupted me

99
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.920
Gabriel Lara: What I do ask me what he said. He said, Well, what did they say

100
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, hang in there. And here we go.

101
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Oh, you're drinking coffee and I didn't get to say this part because I got interrupted. What I'm hearing to the doctor is if we eat.

102
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're gonna you're gonna do it anyway. And I know

103
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.440
Gabriel Lara: That I'm taking my medication. This morning, more than once.

104
00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So here, here's what I'm going to do. You've made up your mind that you know what I'm thinking you're already taking action on it. If you haven't heard me yet.

105
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You still haven't heard it.

106
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one. My intention is to make sure you are getting your full dose, which doesn't seem like that's a good thing.

107
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So number one, don't hold on to that number two. I want to finish my sentence before you say anything so that you can actually hear what I haven't been able to spit out yet.

108
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What I've heard from Dr Arielle and from Dr. Solomon is I don't know the exact time frame. But what they discourage is that people drink anything or eat anything cry. You're I think it's 15 minutes. I can't remember exactly what it is to ingestion of the buprenorphine.

109
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Prior, that's what I'm observing. Okay, that's it.

110
00:13:51.540 --> 00:14:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Until. But notice, this isn't the first time we've been here. Notice how it you felt something else, even though the intentions were good to make sure you're benefiting from this medicine completely notice what happened and then right. How did you feel in here.

111
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy. Probably not. Come on, you can do it in there.

112
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: These are important pieces.

113
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.350
Gabriel Lara: What just

114
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you

115
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling right now.

116
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not a story, an actual emotion like happy, sad, angry irritated frustrated jealous disgusted.

117
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: frustrated when you would know. I don't know. Are you frustrated

118
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.850
Gabriel Lara: Yes.

119
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes.

120
00:14:52.350 --> 00:15:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what belief about me. What assumption about me may have gotten in the way of a fluid nice flow of nice back and forth. Do you know how it got frustrated

121
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.060
Gabriel Lara: I just feel whatever I say something you always like

122
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.860
Gabriel Lara: Water like me like I'm doing something wrong.

123
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. So that's then so that thought she's jumping at me again. I'm doing something wrong.

124
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you have a feeling of frustrated

125
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:30.960
Okay.

126
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that makes sense. I can see how my way of focusing on language and gesture and these things. Yes, I can definitely see that that very logical. I can see how you came to that conclusion.

127
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: WHAT PART DID YOU PLAY IN THIS WOULD SAY

128
00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I addressed right now you're drinking it or I dress behavior and I focus on language, a lot like I'll say, Well, no, that's not quite. It is that is that the focus really on the said this was not said that kind of thing. WHAT WHAT PART DID YOU PLAY IN THIS WOULD YOU SAY

129
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.530
Gabriel Lara: Maybe let you finish what you had to say.

130
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and now my guess is you weren't able to do that because there was a perceived threat right

131
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what was at risk if this doesn't go well what's at stake for you. What's the perceived Fred means you really care what my opinion is really, and I don't hold. I don't think too too much value to you, do I

132
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of my opinion, maybe not so important, but what else could be at risk perceived threat could be going on that we would get ourselves that you might have gotten frustrated

133
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:48.930
Gabriel Lara: From you.

134
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: asking you a question. So you're asking me a question. It's going to get really convoluted fast so Gabriel why

135
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:06.000
Gabriel Lara: I'm reiterating your question, to make sure that I'm getting everything and then he throwing something up for me like

136
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.830
Gabriel Lara: You know, you're making me feel like you're making if you

137
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.800
Gabriel Lara: Wouldn't. But how do you know you're making

138
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: A little I know for sure. I don't make you feel anything. So you have every right to it, hold on to it just getting really clear I'm wanting to know

139
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What perceived threat happened in here may not have been here. I don't know. Maybe it was here before we even long dog together. That's an open ended question.

140
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't already have my mind made up about it. So I don't know what the answer is. You're asking me. So what perceived threat to sit with it a little longer.

141
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: May have existed in our conversation.

142
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe even before we logged on possibly

143
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Did frustration, just go out further

144
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no wrong answer except asking another question is what is happening to you. That's the interesting stuff not my opinion about and it's your next reaction, your body's response. Your next feeling

145
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: When I met with you this morning where you already in a feeling. Do you know if you already had something going on before we even met. Do you know

146
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think that was maybe you know definitively

147
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Gabriel, I can sit with people being even angry with me frustrated. All of those things I do it all day. It's okay. We're going to get past it. We've been in these before. And you know how you end up feeling at the end.

148
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, what do you know we get there, we get through it. Instead of much like what oftentimes happens in people's lives is they get stuck in that and they don't get to see it all the way through to a happy comfortable calm body and feeling good. Again, I have faith will get through it.

149
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right to whatever you're feeling

150
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're not the same as telling a story. And that's all I'm getting out right now is just you know how you felt before you even came in here today. You already feeling something

151
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.030
Gabriel Lara: Wake up a little later.

152
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.500
Gabriel Lara: And I didn't get what

153
00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.720
Gabriel Lara: I was gonna miss on me.

154
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Now that thought I might miss the meeting. Now what feeling like I can picture something I'd rather hear from you thought I might miss it.

155
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.130
Gabriel Lara: Just upsetting.

156
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.790
Gabriel Lara: Me good. That was excellent. Getting sweeping

157
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.340
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, my

158
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.900
Gabriel Lara: My body does is we, again, we won't let them sleep at night. Once I'm dozing off.

159
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.240
Gabriel Lara: Me awake.

160
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Awake, or have you ever done this, where you fall asleep so fast so hard that it wakes you up. Is it that one.

161
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.900
Gabriel Lara: No cuz it's

162
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.790
Gabriel Lara: A little while to get me to sleep.

163
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:49.620
Gabriel Lara: So finally started building off of my body. What is like like my leg will suddenly just Joel

164
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

165
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.330
Gabriel Lara: Happens when I'm

166
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.600
Gabriel Lara: Nervous, and I was nervous about missing the meeting.

167
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a feeling word. And I'll tell you. Can I make a guess about why and you say, yeah, that's it, or you can clarify.

168
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK. So my guess is

169
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There was this clear definitive bridging to this appointment and medication was attached to it. Do you think that's part of it. Like if I missed this meeting.

170
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be another delay or there might be a delay of even some hours of the medication and is it was it somewhere in that space.

171
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:39.060
Gabriel Lara: Whoa, I just remember, you know how I got chewed out a little bit for missing the last one.

172
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, are you being chewed out right now. Is this what chewed out is

173
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.270
Gabriel Lara: No, no.

174
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.430
Gabriel Lara: I was told that

175
00:21:49.050 --> 00:22:01.320
Gabriel Lara: That I wasn't like a no call no show. And now I had to do that assessment online. Then I had that in my mind over time that I forgot that the meeting was Thursday. So when I came in on Friday.

176
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.080
Gabriel Lara: I was surprised to see

177
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.800
Gabriel Lara: The whole time I was just like,

178
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.450
Gabriel Lara: I didn't think it would be that big of a deal.

179
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, this is this is a was a surprise to you that there is

180
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: An effect to missing.

181
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Not, not canceling within 24 hours that does surprise you.

182
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and and it and it caused a connection to today's meeting. Like, what if I missed this one and there was nervousness.

183
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And now there's frustration in here.

184
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.860
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

185
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.200
All right.

186
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Now how often

187
00:22:50.580 --> 00:23:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you get to name things in real time not waiting three days later, or after a big round or holding it in for days, weeks, even months, how, how often do you get to genuinely in the moment, talk to someone about how you're feeling and they don't freak out.

188
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's why these are important and Gabriel. Let me tell you something, you kept but just now. I bet there were big parts of the you wanted to flipped me the bird and run off the screen.

189
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something like that.

190
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

191
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Okay, but you didn't you hung in there.

192
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the moments where you are rewiring the brain so that you really get you can hold on to your truth. You were nervous. There was a lot at stake when she chooses me out, what if, what if I miss this meeting. There's medication, there's this dynamic. There's a lot at stake.

193
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's real that really happened to you.

194
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And how will you meet it talking directly to someone. These are hard.

195
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you did outstanding you hung in there for it.

196
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And just notice what parts stressed out now like that tension and got chest john shoulders back, all those things and it as today moves forward. We lighten it right, it's less like interpersonal and confrontational as it lightens up

197
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice your

198
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Body will register that to the body will feel safe again. Your mind will likely stop fretting your confidence that everything's gonna be okay. Miss appointment. Don't miss

199
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.750
Gabriel Lara: Appointment

200
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we can have a rupture. That's an oversimplification. But we can rupture and we can repair. We can rupture, or it could be like a misunderstanding and we can repair it some relationships. If there's trust if there's just enough, they can be repaired. If we stay in our truth. Okay.

201
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I'm really proud of you. I guess I just wish I had pompoms right now.

202
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

203
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You know those are hard talking directly to someone like that about our feelings, hard, hard, hard stuff.

204
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.380
Gabriel Lara: I need to practice.

205
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I'm actually a safe person to do it with because I'll hold my own right, I don't

206
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Like to

207
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk over me, but I also notice that I don't spend a lot of time talking about this. I didn't talk about my feelings.

208
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not getting into my stuff I'm continuing to focus on what did you use right what skills. Did you use just now and we'll get more into that.

209
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the perception was an interpretation didn't work. Was it you know what other that it's all for you. It just may not have felt like that up front.

210
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard stuff. Most people can't can handle what you just did okay you kicked butt.

211
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Take pride in that

212
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so getting more and more into the breath is way as we review your goals that has worked for you before getting back into the grounding that that perfection of solid body just that breath that I'm okay, kind of in that belly breathing to go in there as as I review.

213
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking at another objective.

214
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the same goal. I want to eliminate my addiction to drugs and alcohol but

215
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The objective itself is something that that i right you guys say your goals and then I kind of come up with some sort of way to get you there through an objective. A tasks that I want you guys to do

216
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And this one has to do with developing a relapse prevention plan over the next few months.

217
00:26:46.380 --> 00:27:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The reality is, this is developing, like if you're with me all year. However long, it's I'm always dropping little things in all along the way. So it's pretty continuous at this point what I have for relapse prevention plan so far is let me get to it here.

218
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the identification of emotional triggers. The first one is really good mood around payday since I like

219
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Since since like age 15 took my first drink it made it more fun. So there's some acknowledgement. This is probably really early on in our discussions probably had to do with an emotional trigger is

220
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Money like payday. Oh, I want to feel good. I want to drink. Does that sound like kind of, yeah. Okay, so that was one

221
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So you would want to keep your eye out for that coming up again because that could be a trigger for for future use. So we want to keep an eye on that one. Something else you said in emotional trigger I told myself I remember this one too.

222
00:27:53.970 --> 00:28:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was where you were going to have a family picnic. Maybe I told myself don't get beers. Yet, if you get some now. By the time the fight was that you guys would have a gathering with a fight right cable.

223
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

224
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. By the time the fight starts this was your self talk, you'll need more beer than the fight started then the self talk, I might miss the fight. If I go to the store. So we got to recognize some of that.

225
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.050
Gabriel Lara: You remember that.

226
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, me too. That's why I like because I kind of grab them and plop them in there and it can bring us back into time in history and

227
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We can review how you've changed or maybe how the the sequence of your thinking your feelings, your beliefs may may change over time so emotional trigger also under that category. I can't. I think this is a self talk. I can't today because I circled the date already has a great day.

228
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I already didn't do it. I was really

229
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Little hack, you did in your head, your head. That was cute like that. So I don't have a lot of relationship trigger written down in here. I do have one I have when fighting

230
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In relationship with Ashley, so I can deal with it.

231
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a big one, that's probably something that, well, I don't know how you're doing around that one. These days, but I'm going to want to check in on how that relationship is doing.

232
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so events and situations that have been triggers. I have. I like conversation. I like giving advice and receiving advice.

233
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how why I decided to put that there. Well this one's a real clear one I am bored and need to get my mind off of it. That would be a situation right boredom.

234
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You might even put that one up and emotional trigger. It's kind of hard to say. I don't know. I don't. Do you remember what this this statement. I like conversation. I like giving advice and receiving advice.

235
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that ever been with substance use, or drinking

236
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.090
Gabriel Lara: I want to say yes. And oh,

237
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't know what that one is. I'm going to leave it there just for further exploration some healthy coping skills. I've got some notes under this one I've got

238
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I told myself don't get beers yet, right, if you go get them. Now you will end up drinking all and need more. So that was a way you I think you were trying to moderate your drinking at that point you were trying to see if you could

239
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Be a social drinker. It sounds. That's a pretty common one for people that haven't are in what's called a pre contemplation contemplation stage of change still hoping I want to be a social drinker.

240
00:30:42.930 --> 00:31:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on this, you know, there's this hope. Okay, it looks like. That was kind of embedded in some of that thought. Let me see. I carried that for a while when fight started self talk of. You can't go now, because you will miss the event that was that was that other thing with the fight.

241
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: pay per view fight, I think. Alright so healthy coping skill, you've got, I need something else.

242
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Will take a huge gulf of Gatorade or Pellegrino water and Burke loudly reminds me of a beer. So you create this mimicking sensation. I think of what a beer does um

243
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see frequency of thoughts at that time, two or three times a day, usually in the evening at 730 and you're thinking at the time. Drink would be nice.

244
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the thought. I have had for many years I end up needing some water. I'm dehydrated. So when you check in.

245
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It sounds like your first thought is, drink a beer would be nice, right, a drink.

246
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you check in further turns out you are dehydrated. So, remembering that has been useful to you what I really need is something to do something else. You said I'm dehydrated. I need something to do

247
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You've also said, biking, the scooter and meditation and meditation is very different for different people. Some people are including that diet fanatic belly breathing that I taught or I changed the name because I don't want the belly part to be forgotten. So I was calling a box breathing.

248
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now going belly ready to know and forgets that you've got to have that

249
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That expanding belly, because not aneurysm of change, but you know I Gabriel. I don't have anyone here.

250
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: For people I can text call email reach out to if I just want to feel connected to someone when I am starting to have some of these things. These thoughts of wanting to use. Is there anyone that you think you could safely comfortably reach out to

251
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.760
Gabriel Lara: Maybe my mom, but I don't think that's a good don't

252
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, but maybe it's about this is this is sort of this

253
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This moment in time for you, whereas there's a new settling in of who will I surround myself with who will be in my group will I bring these party folks will it just be an to be an Ashley.

254
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you starting even to notice people that look like you could trust them, they're trustworthy and that'd be kind of cool to get to know. I mean, keeping your eye out for people

255
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.970
Gabriel Lara: I haven't been legal but that's something that interests me.

256
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:33.930
Yeah.

257
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

258
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So right in this space. What is often used for people useful for people is staying really clear about

259
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What a healthy boundary is what it's an unhealthy boundary. And a lot of times they're learning those they didn't learn and maybe in childhood oftentimes parents don't teach this stuff and so they learn it in therapy.

260
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So keeping an eye out for, let's say you catch yourself liking who you are. Maybe in a moment with Ashley, maybe in a moment with someone in group. Maybe you like yourself in a moment. Maybe you'll catch it in here.

261
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And you remember it, and you're logging in that long term sort of stacked up ledger of man. I kind of like feeling that way. And then when you feel it with someone else.

262
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's at a gym I know everything's like

263
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: On hold right now, but you get the idea. Maybe if I take this sort of martial arts class. We're at a gym or I take maybe I meet someone while I'm working. And I'm like,

264
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I feel this. Feels good. Feels good about who I am. This guy's kind of got got me on the sense of humor.

265
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And seem strong but not not overbearing you know whatever it is that you like kind of being around what feels good, then you might consider saying, hey,

266
00:34:52.590 --> 00:35:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we can connect on a social level because you guys, unlike my role, I can't have any dual I can't have any dual relationships. Right. It's always just therapist client evermore never, never to change.

267
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but most professions, there's this like little overlap. Oh, I met him in school and then we hung out. We met him at work. And now we have

268
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We play golf together. So there's this nice overlap. So just, I would invite you to just start to look around. When do I like how I'm feeling who my around. What am I doing just start kind of looking around with this, the social groups that are around you see

269
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep track of it. Just a thought.

270
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I have also nothing under self soothing.

271
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So self soothing slash self care.

272
00:35:47.340 --> 00:36:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I've spent some time with you on this sort of encouraging and championing cheerleading and trying to get you to do some stuff that feels good, just for you. That feels like it fuels the soul replenishes energy

273
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it can be literally as simple as lotion and grabbing my feet or you might say, you know, Ashley. Let's give each other a background or something like that. That just just feels good.

274
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I do you do any of those things, or even as I'm saying are you thinking, Yeah, I started doing these things that field. They're just for me feel good. I don't have to justify them to anybody. It just, they just so good for me.

275
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.530
Gabriel Lara: I look I listened to.

276
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.460
Gabriel Lara: Like a lot of podcasts. Does that make sense.

277
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.340
Gabriel Lara: So that's kind of hear other people's perspective on things.

278
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay.

279
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Things and so when you're in that state of just sort of listening. Does it feel like all of the worry some any kind of negative thinking is just sort of not there. You're really immersed in what you're listening to. And you're interested

280
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.280
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

281
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. And that's, that's a good one. So, remembering that if you start to have, you know, how you were saying there was some upset and nervous.

282
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: About some another one. And you're frustrated, like any of those feelings that might be a good one, though I worry about the backlighting that blue light thing with our screen time when we're trying to sleep.

283
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This

284
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: One might be a little, I don't know, maybe this isn't what's going to just stop you from falling asleep but

285
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be a way for you to, you know, I'm just going to turn the light on and I'm going to just watch a podcast. Everything's gonna be okay.

286
00:37:48.480 --> 00:38:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I have had some misunderstandings with bright heart health, with one of your with the doc or something and it worked out. It ended up working out. Okay, I will be okay. You know, that's what I was talking about earlier about that threat response. It can seem in the moment, very light unsettling.

287
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But remembering you have had history with everything turned out okay just had to hang in there for it. All right.

288
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.090
Gabriel Lara: Yeah yeah

289
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we've got I touched on those two you've got

290
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: One fear, which is

291
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be a better husband. Last time I wrote a little note on that was

292
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Client describing life demonstrates effort to control his friendships money and his worst fear is she will keep his son away from him. If they separate.

293
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so now I'm at was months ago and I imagine there's been different sort of ups and downs and things along the way, how are things right now around your assessment of you as a husband.

294
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.520
Gabriel Lara: I think I'm doing okay I'm I'm better than I was.

295
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.350
Gabriel Lara: You know, I'm a little more calm. I don't jump to conclusions I don't I'm

296
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:17.220
Gabriel Lara: Gonna try to see things from another perspective, like my mouth shut. A little more instead of trying to fight back on things.

297
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.210
Gabriel Lara: I feel like that's where you know

298
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.890
Gabriel Lara: The biggest said that I don't like. I just don't acknowledge it and

299
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm like, wait a minute.

300
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: My clients doing the thing that we did right in the beginning.

301
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.300
Like yeah

302
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get a chance to see it through to say

303
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling this around what you just said. I like to not feel like this. So let's keep seeing if maybe I it was my misinterpretation.

304
00:39:53.790 --> 00:40:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Or like, what's your intent behind why you're saying it. And so, yeah, as your therapist, I worry because I don't want any of my clients feeling like their thoughts, beliefs and preferences are secondary

305
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To someone else's. They're not less, man.

306
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is different. So watch the difference. I keep my mouth shut.

307
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone says something. I don't like right I try not to what I try not to say anything. Is that what you're doing currently

308
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.040
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, let's do anything at all.

309
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

310
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the difference between something that might not

311
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't quite tell what this is doing to you, but typically in psychology that energy that longing to be known understood and feel accepted loved like all of those

312
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't like continue to invest in those through each day each time. We're talking with like for you. It's like, It's Ashley.

313
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You build up resentment.

314
00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

315
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or we get ourselves physically sick.

316
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it's no joke that connection between the mind and body, it's very powerful we give ourselves these sort of like maybe a kidney stone or we give ourselves these sort of, you know, gastrointestinal problems, you know,

317
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess what I wonder is this. What's the difference between watch this in my left hand is I just shut up versus

318
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I think through, do I really care like nine or 10 out of 10 about my point. My need

319
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: My feelings which is because we all do we think it through this just carte blanche, no matter what this one of my left hand is just, it's black and white. It's just, oh hey what she's saying, God, I can't say anything to lead to a fight.

320
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then nothing, said I'm exaggerating, obviously. So that's on my left hand, but on the right hand is discretion, which means

321
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Deliberately saying I have a right to say something. But I'm thinking about, like, you think it through.

322
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what she just said, I was just. She's just being petty in this ain't worth the fight. And frankly, I already know. She doesn't actually believe what she's saying.

323
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What she does counts more, and you know, I feel like dealing with this and this ain't nothing but a thing. In other words, you thought it through and you also sometimes decide that one, that one, I want to check on you know I have a right to say something I want to say something, huh.

324
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What this really hits a core conviction and value doesn't match mine. I want to check in Ashley with how you really feel. So the difference is I think something through my right hand. And this one is I have no right to speak.

325
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This one has discretion. I have a right to speak. I taught. I walked it through the cause effect in my mind and like this one. Why bother.

326
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Me really not that big a deal to me you know that one. But then there's one three days later. Now, this one, this one man, I feel, oh my chest, my back. I'm all tight like I feel really strongly about what just happened.

327
00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to share this one right and this one you you present like you have no right to speak right hand I have a right to speak, but I'm using

328
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of discretion around it like I'm thinking it through is a really don't really care that much. Yeah. And then it will eat away at the self at, you know what I'm trying to say the difference

329
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.040
Gabriel Lara: That we did. I probably wouldn't

330
00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok ok so honest with yourself, which is it more often, you know, you have a right to speak.

331
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then Gabriel, it becomes, then, then it's just skills of like wordplay. You know, like, I'll have some phrases that I throw out that I use a lot and I want my clients to help them to I just looked at as like a skill.

332
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: As a user, I'm not using that's up to you but it's right around that I have a right to my own opinion, even if I'm wrong, like I was way off base.

333
00:44:52.770 --> 00:45:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have a right to check it out. You don't lose that right, just because someone's gets so angry and goes over the top right still happen. You don't lose that right to your opinion and to your feelings.

334
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one do you tend to be the one that just honors the fact that your opinion prefacing preferences and things have just as much right

335
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is it up.

336
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.460
Gabriel Lara: I think

337
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.980
Gabriel Lara: A combination of both, but more of your left hand.

338
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do get the privilege of seeing a little bit in our dynamic too because there's, it's an interesting thing. I think someone else might see it as

339
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe argumentative or something, but I don't see it like that. I see it more like you deprive yourself, day after day after day of speaking

340
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay quiet. I'm not saying anything. I'm not gonna say anything and then

341
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Not again comes up, maybe something like that well. Not now. Not this time. I've had it. And then there's this sort of building up of pressure. And that's what I wonder if that's happening.

342
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know why not be

343
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.220
Gabriel Lara: I think that's a lot of what happens. Yeah.

344
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.970
Gabriel Lara: I think could happen like that that way for a lot of people

345
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it does.

346
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's normal. It's very common, but we have to, we're not really saying, Well, is it normal common okay we'll work past that maybe a deeper question is

347
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it adaptive to you. Is it helping you emotionally, psychologically, physically in your career and your marriage and your family, you know, is it an adaptive. That's a deeper question.

348
00:46:54.450 --> 00:47:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's working for you by then you'll keep doing it. If not, may want to kind of check in on different ways to approach.

349
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Your right

350
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.560
To do.

351
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Not an easy thing because I already know there's this this threat of

352
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger.

353
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And and taking your things away this interesting thing, put a pin on that for a minute because we've we've gone into that several times, but I'm just going to kind of make a couple notes here in in goals so I I stay focused.

354
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I will attend individual therapy bi weekly okay so we got one.

355
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So do

356
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:05.790
Hmm.

357
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So actually I don't want to move from this, this seems pretty important. I want to be a better husband, so

358
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's better husband.

359
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Measured by the frequency of fighting. I can't quite tell how you're measuring yourself.

360
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.730
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

361
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you're the cause of the fighting.

362
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.870
Gabriel Lara: It can be a little bit of both.

363
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I hear more about how you measure, I'm assuming, well let's just say better husband. How else are you measuring yourself as better husband, aside from holding back

364
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.950
Gabriel Lara: That that's about it. That's how I react to certain things.

365
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.160
Gabriel Lara: Tolerating certain things, remembering that not everyone is perfect.

366
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.340
Gabriel Lara: Not accept that flaws, whether it be

367
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:13.950
Gabriel Lara: A short fuse.

368
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.960
Gabriel Lara: Personality

369
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Balancing

370
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.350
Yeah, boy.

371
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's really just that piece. It's

372
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're measuring. I'm a better husband, if I'm not

373
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Other issues are I think tolerating people's imperfection.

374
00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:02.190
Gabriel Lara: That too. And I'm less argumentative and more supportive

375
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

376
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.460
Angry

377
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

378
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about support. Um, how might that show up because supports just a word.

379
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What is how is that behavior lives. Like, how will you know whether you're being what you're calling better husband i've been i've been more supportive this week. This day this month. This year I will, you know, what we believe, seeing what someone else see

380
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.810
Gabriel Lara: Being like more supportive

381
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.170
Gabriel Lara: People like allergies.

382
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.880
Gabriel Lara: And not jump to conclusion.

383
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.190
Gabriel Lara: You know them.

384
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.600
Gabriel Lara: Like trying to attack me family comes

385
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I didn't quite hear that. So I'm trying to see. So if someone

386
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Supportive

387
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The picture. She's in the room. Ashley's

388
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How if someone was watching a video of you to, how would they know you are being supported, what would they see you doing or not doing

389
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This is something you would say

390
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I got the don't jump to conclusion I got that part as there's some other part of

391
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think.

392
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, oh, goodness, I'm so sorry.

393
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

394
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My god. Okay.

395
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, well, why don't you write down how this might be kind of cool. Write down

396
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And do what you just did, or text me whatever works for you. The ways that you can show support.

397
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:11.520
Gabriel Lara: ways I can show support.

398
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:16.020
Gabriel Lara: Well, cuz I can

399
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.530
Gabriel Lara: I can

400
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.790
Gabriel Lara: I can show. So, for

401
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:35.250
Gabriel Lara: Maybe hoping

402
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That feel does your body kind of say, yeah, that that would constitute better husband behavior and your world.

403
00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.650
Gabriel Lara: That is, don't, don't know what else I can do.

404
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.130
Gabriel Lara: Because I feel like I'm you know when it comes to like taking care of the baby. I do pretty much as much as I can. I'm feeling in my change and

405
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:04.110
Gabriel Lara: Do a lot for him. I think that's pretty supportive

406
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.590
Gabriel Lara: have invested financially relationship, you know, I can show you the good part of

407
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.780
Gabriel Lara: What we need

408
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:18.540
Gabriel Lara: Everything.

409
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what I heard, I heard

410
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you showed me that. So I'm going to interpret supportive means I don't jump to conclusions I can listen. Can I get that right. That's what this I can listen

411
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All around the house smart and

412
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Those would constitute sort of being more supportive and we've covered the, the less angry part has to do with accepting people aren't perfect.

413
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.600
Gabriel Lara: Exactly.

414
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had a chance to do it in vivo right now because you suspect that she's listening and you probably have an emotional reaction to that in a preference. Don't you

415
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.200
Gabriel Lara: Yes.

416
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:09.780
Yeah.

417
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can either

418
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Address it talk with her about it, share it in some way, because maybe it's striking a really core piece for you. Or maybe it's around trust don't know. Or maybe it's one of those little ones like you know what

419
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my, Ashley she tends to be insecure kind of worries that I'm tripping or

420
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Cheating flirting, right, because that's her right part for history. So that's probably ALL THAT WAS AND YOU KNOW WHAT AM JUST GO AROUND around in circles. Ain't nothing and change. So you might decide it isn't worth it or you might say,

421
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: To yourself it's worth it to me because I, I need to trust. I want to be trusted. So, only you know where that line is

422
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Alrighty then. Now just curious.

423
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: As we near the end of the session. Are you comfortable enough talking about how you're feeling now kind of member. He said, how we might start here really oh boy got a lot going on. And then I was kind of predicting thinking there might be a settling in the heart rate.

424
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The breathing the mindset. How has it changed from how it was really are to now.

425
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.730
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, I'm definitely more mellow now than it was when they gave me

426
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:44.820
Gabriel Lara: And I both start believing these things. And I know that I'm not crazy. I believe that I'm right.

427
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:54.060
Gabriel Lara: Then, you know. So then I have to be right and then they come in here and then you know you tell me things that

428
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:55.530
Kind of

429
00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:59.700
Gabriel Lara: go against what I was thinking. And I don't

430
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.670
Gabriel Lara: Know how you do that every time.

431
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, no, um,

432
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we all do these things, Gabriel right

433
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I do them to everybody doesn't

434
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And

435
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess what I'm encouraging is to pay attention to what you did that got you to this calm state. Now I can see what I did like all the writing a note, nobody like you know I did this and I did this now but important person here at you. What did I do, huh.

436
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to choose just enough curiosity over being right. I hadn't done that one's probably familiar. I had to accept.

437
00:56:55.050 --> 00:57:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, maybe I miss understood. You had to have just enough maybe to get past

438
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The I'm right. I feel right. I heard what I heard. I'm not crazy how to get past that, which is probably something you have to sit with a lot like I will not go crazy. I heard what I heard you're not going to tell me I didn't hear it.

439
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I definitely don't want you to feel crazy

440
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What I do is I slow way down. And remember, I just, I wouldn't move I zeroed in right here. I wouldn't go here, I just

441
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It was right here, this little phrase. This is where it got ruptured. And so I kept bring us back to it and it's uncomfortable. It's like, well, I was right about I heard what I heard. Because then

442
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If we if we say, well, this, this part was awful. But then I did these three other things after it. That means I have to put into question these three things I did after it, and no ego right self doesn't want to look at that. That's too many back to back off.

443
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I have like hypothesis about why these things happen.

444
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But ultimately you you did something you did. You did something really important. And I'm suspecting

445
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a scale that was tipped around, I have to be right, something else.

446
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Moved up in importance above, I have to be right. You know what that was.

447
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to take that turtle. Give it some think because I see you writing. I wonder if journaling could be a part of kind of how you

448
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Really marinating sit with some of these challenges that are kind of going on in your head. These conflicts. Like, how can I feel so right and then she ends up flipping things around on me. By the end, how does this happen.

449
00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you did do some things to make it possible for us to continue to talk and talk it through. He did. I didn't do it. It's not have any magic.

450
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You did something

451
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So my invitations to kind of do some reflection on that maybe what you notice that you did.

452
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: In that moment to value something more than being right. What was it, what value did you put above being right long enough for you and I to persevere to get through to get clear to communicate.

453
00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be maybe a little spending time on journaling and reflecting on are you open to that.

454
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.140
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, no, I just thought maybe

455
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:33.390
Gabriel Lara: Maybe I'm wrong.

456
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

457
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

458
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think you were wrong. I think you heard exactly what you heard

459
00:59:46.440 --> 01:00:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's the thing. I won't be going to wrong. I won't be saying, well then suck. Because guess what if that means that I'm right. Then somebody has to be wrong. What if we just get rid of that language all together and we just choose curiosity.

460
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Over what if we stop seeking trying to be right.

461
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we just sort of change that language and just say, I want to understand more of what, how could this be that we have this this confusion, you know, because we can hang in the conversation longer if we're not offended for not angry. We can hang in there for a little longer.

462
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But I heard what you you came up with was, well, maybe she's right. Or maybe I'm wrong, that you were able to hold that thought. Okay.

463
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

464
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget I'm going to message, your doctor right now and I'm going to say he's you. Do you need anything, I don't do much beyond so and so attended, but if you want me to say anything about your support medicine that maybe needs to be ordered to say anything about anything but

465
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:20.250
Gabriel Lara: I have enough for today. I'll just name my dose for tomorrow.

466
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.320
Gabriel Lara: Just want to let them know

467
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.960
Gabriel Lara: until Friday.

468
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll let him. Let him do his deal. I'm just going to say that you are here.

469
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.970
Say attended

470
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This individual counseling. Now I'm just curious. Um, oh let's schedule another appointment.

471
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you don't you don't need any other because he could order it. I'm guessing today if you want him to order a gamma pen or a quantity or something. I could write it for you. Okay, he's out of this or that.

472
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.510
Gabriel Lara: I don't know if I was going to get some more.

473
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:23.610
Gabriel Lara: gabapentin I have some Clonidine what i don't know i think i have a reset. One more. We feel for the gabapentin at the pharmacy. I just, um, maybe you can mention to him that I need it. Was he can just bridge mean to be a theme that I can think of today for tomorrow and tomorrow afternoon.

474
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's what that's what this means he knows what why I'm bothering to say he's here.

475
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.000
Oh,

476
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You knows what's up.

477
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even have to say it.

478
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But I will say that you don't you have a dose for today. And that's it.

479
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:42.090
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

480
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:46.050
Gabriel Lara: Yeah. But yeah, I have enough quantity

481
01:02:47.250 --> 01:03:00.660
Gabriel Lara: But just I think I have one more gabapentin resell then I'll bring it to the ascension tomorrow that if if he can send me some more cuz they only gives me seven at a time. So he doesn't want me taking them very often. So I usually don't

482
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so our next individual let's just see what we got here.

483
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna
