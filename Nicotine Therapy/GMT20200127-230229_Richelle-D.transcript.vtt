00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.960
Christina Anderson: And yes, you did.

11
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.690
Richelle Direny: Okay, I am meeting for an individual. Yes, I am. I remember now. So what's been going on. How's everything going

12
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.810
Christina Anderson: Good, same old stuff.

13
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.960
Just

14
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.140
Christina Anderson: hectic holidays are over, but my daughter's birthday is tomorrow. And I was not prepared at all.

15
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.460
Christina Anderson: So, um, yeah. But everything else has been good works been good.

16
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.900
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good. Well, you know what, listen.

17
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:09.180
Richelle Direny: When I do get when you know the holidays are over, and we're here safely. Thank God. But, um, you know, like you said, when the birthdays come creeping up right around the corner, you have to get repaired.

18
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.250
Richelle Direny: Brother. How old is your daughter.

19
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.050
Christina Anderson: Is going to be three.

20
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.360
Christina Anderson: Oh, yes.

21
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:26.220
Richelle Direny: So, definitely. It's a little different when they're that young because you can't give them the excuse of, well, you just had Christmas. You kind of have to go with the whole flow of everything.

22
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.980
Richelle Direny: Right. So, okay, I do know let me, let me just checking.

23
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.410
Richelle Direny: No, I do see

24
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.600
Richelle Direny: That you have you have a copay with your insurance.

25
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.270
Christina Anderson: Yeah, um,

26
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.440
Christina Anderson: I always forget which is which. But how was with God. It was like

27
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:11.070
Christina Anderson: All together, between the doctor. And Jodi, I'd pay like 110 a month or something. I think Jody's was like the 20 and he's. This was the larger vice versa. I'm not sure.

28
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.060
Richelle Direny: And you met you met with her often like once a month for individual you

29
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.260
Christina Anderson: Will know I never met what in her for individual. It was always group. Oh, it was always group. Okay. Okay.

30
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.350
Richelle Direny: So no, because I was just looking here on your profile that

31
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:48.480
Richelle Direny: That you had a copay. But of course, that's something that you deal with feeling. I don't think that, but so what's been going on, like, I know that they were there was a little bit of concern. And that's partly why they did. They were requested that you meet you meet me for individual right

32
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.770
Christina Anderson: I don't know. I thought it was just because God was leaving or doing something else.

33
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.180
Christina Anderson: Well,

34
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.160
Richelle Direny: We do groups.

35
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.360
Richelle Direny: I believe

36
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.410
Richelle Direny: On Mondays, but like once a month, I believe in the look at 12 o'clock or something like that.

37
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.060
Christina Anderson: Oh yeah change or something.

38
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.480
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it changed. So for some people, I think.

39
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:30.000
Richelle Direny: There was a few people that will be on the back schedule where they're going to be with her once a month at that time. And then for everyone else on that needed to do in for groups, it would be I do the groups on Tuesdays at 630 is when I do because I wasn't able to do Mondays at 530

40
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.640
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's why we change that, but I can't. Again, um, I was, I guess they wanted to address. I don't know if something occurred.

41
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.390
Richelle Direny: Between you and one of the care coordinators, where there was some obscene languages that was being sent.

42
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.450
Richelle Direny: To them, so they wanted it wanted me to meet with us to kind of like check ins and see what was going on.

43
00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:01.470
Richelle Direny: And to kind of address like what whatever had transpired because they because when I spoke with Jody, she was a little bit baffled. And she's like, well, that doesn't sound my car. So let's see what's going on.

44
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.410
Christina Anderson: Yeah, that's weird cuz I don't know what any of that.

45
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.270
Richelle Direny: You don't know what to talk. No.

46
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.590
Richelle Direny: I don't know. Let's see if you have a new number. So that's another thing. Did you change your phone number.

47
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.030
Christina Anderson: Oh, it was probably my asshole boyfriend.

48
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.340
Christina Anderson: It was

49
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.730
Christina Anderson: An asshole.

50
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.140
Christina Anderson: But now you know

51
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.730
Christina Anderson: A while ago. Yeah.

52
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.290
Richelle Direny: Okay, because

53
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.970
Christina Anderson: That's our date, um,

54
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.110
Richelle Direny: So, because I can but it seemed like it was coming from. I guess your contact information, but it was like messages.

55
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.090
Richelle Direny: That was being sent to the care coordinator. I don't know. Like, what was the conversation back and forth. But one of the concerning things were

56
00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:05.730
Richelle Direny: There was a lot of obscene languages, you know, just kind of the verbal aggression that was going on with those messages. So they wanted me to add because I dress it with you because it was on more than one occasion that it happened.

57
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:18.750
Christina Anderson: Not My only guess is he gets in these jealous fits and was trying to figure out who it was. That's my only guess I'm because this is news to me.

58
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:36.570
Richelle Direny: Okay, so let's see. So maybe it is, and which is in which is funny. It's good when you have you build a rapport with the person you've been working with because she thought maybe someone took her phone. Maybe there's something going up and she thought it sounded really weird.

59
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.770
Right.

60
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:52.830
Richelle Direny: And let me see if it was because we do have some care coordinators that are male. So unless he's like jealous. Whether you're speaking to a male or female, and that's why he's um

61
00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:03.900
Christina Anderson: Well, the thing is, is he gets into my boost call history and any number. He doesn't say all I'm going to text them and I'm going to see who it is. Blah, blah, blah.

62
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.960
Christina Anderson: But he never mentioned those number and then maybe it didn't occur to me because I was like

63
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:22.020
Christina Anderson: It's an out of area code, and I didn't realize. And I was like, well, it's probably a telemarketer blah, blah, blah. And he still you know message or something and got all pissy or something, I don't know.

64
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.420
Christina Anderson: Ask him about

65
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.870
Christina Anderson: How long ago was that I'm trying to find, you know, I'm trying to find it.

66
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:42.840
Richelle Direny: Because even when I was reading it, I was like, okay, wow. I mean, I've never met with her, but I'll try to address what's going on a little bit much.

67
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.210
Christina Anderson: Yeah, he's a bit much.

68
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.240
Richelle Direny: But are you still with him.

69
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.460
Yeah.

70
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.590
One of those things.

71
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.480
Richelle Direny: So it was never on your case plan with God to

72
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.640
Richelle Direny: Meet for

73
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.790
Individuals

74
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.280
Christina Anderson: Know,

75
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:28.080
Christina Anderson: I don't know if it's because my insurance didn't. I mean, not that they covered it anyways but for a while I was on Medicaid. I don't know how that worked with group and individual, but since the beginning. I've been on like two or three years now. It's always been a group

76
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.280
Richelle Direny: That it was always approved or not.

77
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.990
Christina Anderson: Always a group

78
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.170
Christina Anderson: Because when I changed my employers insurance. I had to start paying

79
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.530
Christina Anderson: But either way, even when I was on Medicaid. It was a group, but that was all covered

80
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.440
Richelle Direny: I think it was sometime in early January.

81
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.510
This one.

82
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:08.580
Richelle Direny: One, I think it was an early. What are we 2727. So yeah, I think it was like early game worried

83
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.280
Richelle Direny: That the messages kept coming back and forth, but address the obscene language.

84
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.350
Richelle Direny: It was it was almost as if it was, um,

85
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:40.110
Richelle Direny: It was as if the messages were um but provoking almost like to insinuate like a threat in some way.

86
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.790
Yeah.

87
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.250
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so you guys must have been in like a pretty good argument there when he sent those messages.

88
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.630
Probably

89
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.920
Christina Anderson: Oh my god.

90
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's the reason I said, well, I'll meet with her.

91
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.180
Richelle Direny: Address it but

92
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.640
Christina Anderson: Like, oh my God, I hope she doesn't cuss me out.

93
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.250
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna find that, like, okay, so I'm going to meet with her and

94
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:09.960
So, okay.

95
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.700
Christina Anderson: No, no, no.

96
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.110
Okay.

97
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.220
Richelle Direny: Now now for your individual I mean for groups. How often do you go to groups.

98
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.900
Christina Anderson: Once a month.

99
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.180
Richelle Direny: And it's always been like that.

100
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.420
Christina Anderson: He all will know um

101
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.850
Christina Anderson: There was a time where was every week and then it got to every month.

102
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:51.840
Christina Anderson: Because I had been on the program for so long, I guess. And I don't know if it was trying to help me out with because I have to pay a lot if it was weekly

103
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.760
Christina Anderson: The combination of the both. I don't know.

104
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.280
Richelle Direny: Okay. It was on the

105
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.520
Christina Anderson: Third of January this month.

106
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.770
Christina Anderson: Look,

107
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.650
Christina Anderson: That look at his phone. Oh my god.

108
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.510
Richelle Direny: FYI. I don't know what it was a message that was sent to you.

109
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.170
Richelle Direny: And it

110
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.310
Richelle Direny: Then the record by was

111
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.980
Here, let me

112
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.710
Richelle Direny: The messages were just, they were asking me to call bright heart health.

113
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:57.420
Richelle Direny: Oh, yes. So it was him. So it's, um, that on the 14th. They actually called you schedule an appointment with me. A man can answer the phone and ask that we not call. The phone anymore.

114
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.290
Christina Anderson: Lord

115
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.930
Richelle Direny: Does he know you're part of our program.

116
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.300
Christina Anderson: You knows I'm part of a program, but I don't know if you necessarily know that it's called bright heart.

117
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.670
Richelle Direny: So he knows that. But like a program like a Suboxone and you see I

118
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.030
Richelle Direny: Gotta

119
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:21.210
Richelle Direny: You gotta prove so he he knows the details of what but he doesn't know the name of the program.

120
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.190
Christina Anderson: Wow. Yeah. Probably not.

121
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:34.080
Richelle Direny: Okay. And I guess what those messages. It was the repeated messages and then I guess that's when in the beginning.

122
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:46.290
Richelle Direny: Um, that's when he replied, and then there were there were text messages or whatever SMS messages will, however, they said, bright heart sends messages and then he

123
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.340
Richelle Direny: Said the person was coming to Pope hope.

124
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.210
Richelle Direny: And then on the fourth

125
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.390
Richelle Direny: What time is it in Michigan.

126
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.220
Six o'clock.

127
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.430
Richelle Direny: Okay, then the second one was, quote, come get this shit.

128
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.340
Christina Anderson: Come get

129
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.440
Christina Anderson: Yes.

130
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.000
Christina Anderson: That's all the

131
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:21.210
Richelle Direny: Messages that was being sent to the care coordinators when they tried to get in contact with you to schedule appointments and

132
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.970
Richelle Direny: I don't know. Are you up to date with your arm you your UDS

133
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.410
Christina Anderson: Um, I know they just sent me another one. So I'm up to date as far as when this one arrives.

134
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.010
Richelle Direny: Okay, so maybe that was maybe the attempt in terms of communicating with you.

135
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:54.960
Richelle Direny: And so maybe I'm maybe having a conversation with him, letting him know that there are times that you will get a concept of, you know, a call from action, even if it's from the area code.

136
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:55.830
Christina Anderson: Because

137
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:01.500
Richelle Direny: Like you maybe not know the number, but at least you have you're familiar with the area code.

138
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.640
Christina Anderson: Right.

139
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.110
Richelle Direny: And so, you know, he's mindful, because I'm

140
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.910
Richelle Direny: You know i can i can understand the suspicion.

141
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.660
Richelle Direny: When you're getting random calls and he's not really aware and if he is the jealous type

142
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.440
Richelle Direny: Right, you definitely want to address that.

143
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.200
Richelle Direny: At least now wake up.

144
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.270
Christina Anderson: I will for sure.

145
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.720
Richelle Direny: You don't want to get dropped from a program just because you're jealous boyfriend.

146
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.830
Why

147
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.350
Christina Anderson: Oh my god.

148
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.500
Richelle Direny: Um, when did you attend the group.

149
00:14:45.480 --> 00:15:00.000
Christina Anderson: Um, well, I checked in, but God wasn't there because maybe she had changed already. Um, I tried this, the first Monday of this month, but previous to that it would have been the first Monday of December.

150
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.650

155
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:46.830
Christina Anderson: Yeah. And then I finally saw my emails and then that's what got me in touch with her because I don't really look at my emails a lot. And then I just, you know, happened to scroll. And then I saw the email.

156
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.670
Christina Anderson: So that's when I finally called and then I updated the number because you didn't tell me about any of it.

Richelle Direny: So,

172
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:24.630
Richelle Direny: I mean, I started. I'm doing one because I do know that there's quite a number of people that attend that they do monthly

173
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:38.130
Richelle Direny: Groups. So you can just join the group for tomorrow at 630 and I have, I think there are some people were going every third of them.

174

Richelle Direny: I think it was every third Monday or something like that. But what I said just to keep myself on track with them to patients that to monthly I would prefer the first Monday. I mean, sorry. The first Tuesday of every month. If you do attend monthly

Christina Anderson: At 630 at 630 yeah

181
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:42.840
Richelle Direny: You just kind of see where you are with terms of your treatment plan. Let's just see where that

182
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.250
Richelle Direny: Are you doing individual counseling out in the community.

183
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.220
Christina Anderson: Now know

184
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.290
Richelle Direny: If you've never done individual

185
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.370
Know,

186
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.050
Richelle Direny: It said that you met that goal. A year ago.

187
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.530
Christina Anderson: Oh, well I mean in terms of meeting with a doctor about my anxiety, maybe

188
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.590
Richelle Direny: Were you seeing a psychiatrist or you were seeing

189
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.580
Christina Anderson: If I probably just a family doctor

190
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.780
Richelle Direny: And so your family doctor was writing, writing prescriptions.

191
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.380
Christina Anderson: Yeah, I'm for Paxil

192
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.460
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you never seen you were the only diagnosed with anxiety.

193
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.110
Christina Anderson: Yes.

194
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.590
Richelle Direny: Never depression or anything, any other mental illness.

195
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.340
Richelle Direny: No. Okay. And you've never seen a psychiatrist.

196
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.390
Know,

197
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.650
Christina Anderson: I'd like to, I just never really thought about looking into it and seeing if it's covered

198
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:09.390
Richelle Direny: In I'm sure your insurance cameras on psychiatry in what psychiatrist, you only typically see them once a month.

199
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.650
Christina Anderson: Oh,

200
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.360
Richelle Direny: That's just for med management. I mean, when, when it comes down to medication.

201
00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:23.520
Richelle Direny: Yes, your family doctor can write those prescriptions. But then, for every drug. It's really class with a particular specialist

202
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:32.790
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of like your family doctor can write you if you were pregnant, they can write you free needles are you going to just keep going to your family doctor, you're going to go to your OB GYN

203
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.290
Christina Anderson: Right.

204
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:44.520
Richelle Direny: You understand because they thought there's they follow you. Whatever medication, they put you on there certain tests that they do. There are certain protocols that they follow so

205
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:51.030
Richelle Direny: If you were diagnosed with a mental illness, it's best to follow a Psychiatry's you're only checking in with them once a month.

206
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.730
Richelle Direny: If, like you're on Paxil, and if the Paxil isn't working. The other go up or down.

207
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:06.300
Richelle Direny: Or maybe it's just that you've gotten immune to it. And so maybe they need to try different Manson there certain blood tested me to to monitor those levels in your system.

208
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.470
Yeah.

209
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.820
Richelle Direny: Like I said psychiatrist is typically one someone

210
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.420
Christina Anderson: Okay, yeah, I'll look into it for sure.

211
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.570
Richelle Direny: If you you say you have private insurance or you have Medicaid

212
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.910
Christina Anderson: I private now.

213
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.040
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you definitely. I mean I wouldn't know. But interest at this comfort mental health.

214
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.600
Richelle Direny: I mean, it felt a lot of it was for your, you know, ability. Now, how long have you been

215
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.940
Richelle Direny: Have you had sobriety.

216
00:21:50.010 --> 00:22:03.330
Christina Anderson: Um, since I started, I haven't relapsed so since I started the program, pretty much. I mean, a few weeks prior to that too because finally hit rock bottom. I didn't have anything

217
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.050
Christina Anderson: So ever since. Yeah, though. What was it like August or September of 2017

218
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.940
Richelle Direny: Pretty much since you have your daughter, what did I say daughter, what do you have a daughter, or a son.

219
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.050
Yeah, daughter.

220
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.990
Christina Anderson: So if you

221
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:27.060
Richelle Direny: Had your at your daughter, you haven't had to read. So you were clean before you got pregnant with your daughter.

222
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:37.380
Christina Anderson: Um no I wasn't clean and then I got clean. When I was pregnant, and then I relapsed a little after and then that's when I was like, enough is enough.

223
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:44.790
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so after that, like, it was kind of started having anxiety after that.

224
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:57.120
Christina Anderson: Yeah, I mean, I've always had anxiety. Um, I mean, obviously, when I was taking the bills that helped, but I've had that since I was like in high school.

225
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.850
Richelle Direny: What do you think, bring on your anxiety.

226
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:16.530
Christina Anderson: I don't. Well, I'm, I, my family. It might be Jeanette. I know this genetic, but I know like my great grandma She suffered from depression. She tried to kill herself toys. I mean, I don't know if that was anxiety, too, but I know

227
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.790
Christina Anderson: There is like mental health issues.

228
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.440
Christina Anderson: Um, you know, in my line. My family line.

229
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.130
Christina Anderson: But otherwise, I really don't know. I just always

230
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.990
Just

231
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.910
Richelle Direny: Invited

232
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:50.520
Christina Anderson: Will actually like an anxiety attack. I mean, it's been a long time. Um, I actually had my first anxiety attack when I was like young like 11 or 12 my you know that heart racing and arm numbing thing.

233
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.370
Christina Anderson: I never really got that so much. It was just more like of an always being nervous.

234
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.240
Richelle Direny: Kind of like nervous being afraid of the unknown or what happened.

235
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.490
Christina Anderson: Yeah, like that, or even

236
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:19.980
Christina Anderson: Even minor things like knowing I have to drive home from work or like even appointments would sometimes weird me out and I don't know, it's weird. I don't, I don't know why.

237
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.380
Christina Anderson: It's just, I've always just kind of had that heavy lump in my chest.

238
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:37.470
Richelle Direny: And my fear of dying or fear of getting an accident, fear of not being able to get home to your daughter fear a point

239
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:52.140
Christina Anderson: Why don't even know about that so much. It was just, I guess, of just having to maybe get get stuff done. I don't know, it's weird. It's weird. It's hard to explain.

240
00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:03.810
Christina Anderson: Is that I have to do this. I have to do that I have to get home. I got to do this when I'm home or and then I mean it didn't help when I was on the pills, either because I was

241
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:18.060
Christina Anderson: Lying and all that. So that probably made it worse, too. But I don't know why. When I was younger, because I didn't have, you know, I happy childhood and all that. So I just, I don't know.

242
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.790
Richelle Direny: And you said, But you said there is a family history. There is a family history of substance abuse.

243
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.550
Christina Anderson: Yeah, that too, for sure on both sides a mom and dad.

244
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:47.580
Christina Anderson: Mainly alcoholism, though, but I don't touch that stuff. My dad, he got into he was the one who FUNNY THING I'M LIKE HIM. YOU GOT INTO THE PILLS. We always when we were both doing it at the same time. At one point, it would make both of us feel the same like

245
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.540
Christina Anderson: So probably got it from him, like the opiate abuse.

246
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.360
Richelle Direny: You're the only child.

247
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.830
Yes.

248
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.210
Richelle Direny: Well, your parents or your parents are still alive.

249
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.160
Christina Anderson: Yes, they're

250
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:06.630
Christina Anderson: Not

251
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.830
Christina Anderson: That they've remarried. My dad wasn't around

252
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.840
Christina Anderson: She divorced him because of the substance abuse, back then it was mainly cocaine, though, um,

253
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.190
Christina Anderson: And then for a long time up until I was like

254
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.240
Christina Anderson: I don't know 2021 he was

255
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.250
Christina Anderson: In and out of rehabs or. Then finally, he got clean

256
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.740
Richelle Direny: And you still work as a pharmacy technician.

257
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.520
Christina Anderson: No, I'm I work in an office now.

258
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:48.960
Richelle Direny: Okay.

259
00:26:50.370 --> 00:27:00.660
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, it definitely is. This is the thing. I think it's definitely good. And of course, I understand, like, being able to afford it based on your insurance and what they cover and what have you.

260
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.000
Richelle Direny: But, you know, checking in, I would say once a month, because when you're on the Suboxone

261
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:18.540
Richelle Direny: It be well let me say this, like, what is your goal is your goal to be on it long term or to eventually at some point in time taper off of it where you're not necessarily dependent upon it, like, what is your goal.

262
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.250
Christina Anderson: I mean, I

263
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.140
Christina Anderson: Ideally, it would be to taper off one day, but

264
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:38.640
Christina Anderson: Sometimes I feel like if it keeps me normal as well as it has for the past three years, I mean I would do it long term.

265
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.680
Christina Anderson: Um,

266
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.480
Christina Anderson: So I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say. Yeah.

267
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:53.070
Richelle Direny: And that's fine because when you when you are looking at, you know, the Suboxone treatment. It really is.

268
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.270
Richelle Direny: In addition to being on the Suboxone you're doing the group therapy but chat group is, you know, everyone is there, so you're not necessarily going to get

269
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:12.390
Richelle Direny: More a very intimate and personal in a group setting because you're not necessarily going to want to. There are certain things that you're not going to share in a group setting.

270
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:30.540
Richelle Direny: You know, one on one session. Again, you're also not going to feel in the beginning to share a whole lot of things, but as time progresses and you know you develop that therapeutic compliance and that rapport with the individuals who are working with. It's working on identifying

271
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:40.230
Richelle Direny: Those buried feelings, thoughts, or what have you. That kind of keeps like if you said, Why am I getting interest. I don't know.

272
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:49.110
Richelle Direny: And sometimes in talking about it. It brings it into awareness. What is creating that anxiety, in turn, also with

273
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:58.950
Richelle Direny: The Suboxone you're keeping you take the Suboxone to somewhat stabilize you to take away the cravings to take away those addictive tendencies.

274
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:10.620
Richelle Direny: And but you have to identify what's causing those not necessarily be addiction. But what's causing what's bringing you for those desires to want to take

275
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:28.320
Richelle Direny: pills or whatever. What is it that you're suppressing because that's ultimately why you if you drink. Why you take pills. Some people get addicted to pain medication. They it. The reason why they become addicted to the medication. It's because what is the source of it.

276
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:46.230
Richelle Direny: All. Yeah. So I'm in pain. I'm going to take something the medication wore off the pain comes back, I take the band aid.

277
00:29:46.710 --> 00:30:03.780
Richelle Direny: Band Aid is your pill. So until you identify the source of your problem, what is causing the pain, you're always going to reach for the band aid, because the band aid gives you a temporary relief until you address the source of your issue. It's the same way.

278
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:16.680
Richelle Direny: You are doing that you take the Suboxone to take away the craving and that feeling of wanting to gold to all other whatever drug that you were on

279
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:37.800
Richelle Direny: And while you use this as a band aid to cover up these feelings, what is causing these feelings. It's coming into awareness of why. What are these feelings, what is it that I'm asking and until you deal with it and address it. You will always reach for whatever your suppressant is

280
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:50.460
Richelle Direny: And that's what everything is whatever it is that you become addicted to it's a suppressing so until you identifying that. So the question goes back to, would you, and I asked everyone that I work with.

281
00:30:51.450 --> 00:31:03.210
Richelle Direny: What is your goal, your ultimate goal is it that one day in the future, not now, but one day in the future, do you hope to taper off of this medication.

282
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:23.340
Richelle Direny: And if the answer is yes. Well, the only way to do that is that while you're taking this medication to suppress these feelings and whatever it is that you're suppressing to be able to work on the underlining issues, you will never be able to get rid of this.

283
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.320
Richelle Direny: You understand

284
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.220
Christina Anderson: We

285
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:42.690
Richelle Direny: Go to the doctor because we feel pain. We're saying that, or there's something going on in us. So the doctor says why like explore the source of it. I'm going to give you this to relieve to give you some relief.

286
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:53.370
Richelle Direny: Right, well, we still have to address the issue once we've addressed the issue we are going to taper you down on the relief.

287
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:54.540
Christina Anderson: Yeah.

288
00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:07.290
Richelle Direny: And so that's kind of what how I look at therapy therapy is only therapy is also temporary a therapist is not meant to be in your life forever.

289
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:20.550
Richelle Direny: A therapist is only there to help you identify the source of the those emotions that has taken control of you, those feelings that has taken control of

290
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:28.890
Richelle Direny: Those spots that are taking control of you have therapist is there just to help you bring it into awareness and to process it.

291
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.590
Richelle Direny: To help you identify

292
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:40.470
Richelle Direny: Your natural abilities to process to your natural ability to control something the therapist is only help you there to teach you how to

293
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:57.810
Richelle Direny: Gain back your control. Once you're in control of a situation and circumstances as they come up. Eventually you're no longer than me talk therapy or cycle therapy, you're no longer going to need it because now I know how to address these things.

294
00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.130
Richelle Direny: You understand

295
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.890
Richelle Direny: It's like

296
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:08.880
Richelle Direny: Thinking about like you have your three year old daughter, and she's crying and you're neutral rather than

297
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:17.520
Richelle Direny: And follow what she's crying. She's making all this noise. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. Okay. Well, she just needs to be burped or she just needs to be held.

298
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:30.810
Richelle Direny: Um but initially you don't know you're like, I don't know what's going on here. Notice going on. You give her the bottle. I don't want that you give her this if you do all these things and until someone comes in the picture and say,

299
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:37.800
Richelle Direny: Christina folder you need to do. Now you've identified the source of the crime. She just wants to help

300
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:38.910
Christina Anderson: Yeah.

301
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.810
Richelle Direny: need me anymore to tell you what's wrong why your kid is crying.

302
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:56.100
Richelle Direny: You don't need me anymore because I've helped to bring in awareness, the source of your issues. She just needs to be loved. She just needs to be held so no longer do you need it. And that's just kind of how

303
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:18.420
Richelle Direny: I think the whole goal of bright heart is not just the group therapy but along with it is the individual therapy to help you to learn how to gain control how to be able to cope with different things that come in your life, and over time.

304
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:32.460
Richelle Direny: You notice that the individuals will go down to once a month, once every other month when you need it groups will come down to once a month and eventually you'll get you'll regain full control where maybe take

305
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.910
Richelle Direny: On how often you take this medication.

306
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:47.490
Richelle Direny: The point where you're no longer on it now. Hey, I can live a full functioning, healthy life where I don't need anything. And so the question is,

307
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.360
Christina Anderson: What is it

308
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.650
Richelle Direny: That you want to do.

309
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.940
Richelle Direny: That's the question. What do you want to do. What do you want to work.

310
00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:04.620
Richelle Direny: For and then from there, completely therapies here for you. It's really up to you whether or not you want to utilize it.

311
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.850
Richelle Direny: Therapy is here for you.

312
00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:10.710
Richelle Direny: The only

313
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.900
Richelle Direny: Therapy is that you

314
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:22.410
Richelle Direny: You kind of have to do the group therapy in order to get the medication, but I think it encompasses all of it.

315
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.800
Christina Anderson: To help you to move forward.

316
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:26.880
Okay.

317
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.150
Christina Anderson: You have any questions.

318
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.440
Richelle Direny: Or any thoughts.

319
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.230
Christina Anderson: No, I mean,

320
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:44.820
Christina Anderson: They did put in perspective, a little, like, like you said, identify the source and hopefully one day I can be free of it all.

321
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.600
Richelle Direny: I mean, the question is, do you want to be free of it all.

322
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.260
Christina Anderson: I mean, yeah, that would be ideal.

323
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.210
Richelle Direny: It's, it's really think of it as, you know,

324
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.790
Richelle Direny: You want to be. It's like you have individual shackles that's bounding you

325
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.900
Christina Anderson: Yeah.

326
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.420
Richelle Direny: You want to stay that way or do you want to

327
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.370
Christina Anderson: Know, like, what, what do you really want to do. Yeah, I

328
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.050
Richelle Direny: Think you have full control of your life right now full under control of your life in every aspect.

329
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.300
Christina Anderson: Know,

330
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.280
Christina Anderson: Um,

331
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.080
Christina Anderson: I as I do the anxiety, always the

332
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.820
Christina Anderson: Everything's gonna fall apart type feeling

333
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.450
Christina Anderson: Men.

334
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.250
Christina Anderson: It's

335
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.090
Richelle Direny: The one year with

336
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.840
Christina Anderson: As hard as hard

337
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.720
Richelle Direny: What is your goal. Do you want to move

338
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.540
Richelle Direny: Forward, or do you want to release.

339
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.590
Richelle Direny: Do you want to go.

340
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.180
Richelle Direny: Work, or do you want to walk away.

341
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.600
Christina Anderson: I mean, I want to make you work but

342
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:21.360
Christina Anderson: I want to make it work. But the way it's been it's wanting to walk away.

343
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.130
Richelle Direny: Do you think that maybe that's the source of your anxiety for part of

344
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.250
Christina Anderson: Being a part of it.

345
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.080
Richelle Direny: You fear being

346
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.900
Richelle Direny: It. Your daughter's father

347
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.960
Richelle Direny: You fear being a single mom like your mom.

348
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.650
Christina Anderson: No, I actually

349
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.620
Christina Anderson: Would love it at this

350
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.400
Christina Anderson: Um, it's more

351
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.620
Christina Anderson: It's more me feeling

352
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.160
Christina Anderson: Bad

353
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:09.570
Christina Anderson: Mama.

354
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.840
Christina Anderson: It's your me feeling bad because his mother never

355
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:22.080
Christina Anderson: showed him how to be a man or get through life. He's on SSI.

356
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.960
Christina Anderson: He wouldn't know what and now his mom his past. She was always his

357
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.400
For his role.

358
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:35.250
Christina Anderson: As fallback because he doesn't know how to work. He doesn't know how to do any of that.

359
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.090
Christina Anderson: He was never taught. She was a drug addict.

360
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:41.070
Christina Anderson: Um,

361
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:49.080
Christina Anderson: And it's almost like me feeling bad, like, he'll end up homeless will end up on the streets like he has no aspect of how to

362
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.180
Christina Anderson: Have a life of his own or get a job, get a house like

363
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.810
Christina Anderson: And that's where I feel bad.

364
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.850
Richelle Direny: Is it that you feel bad, or you feel like you need to fulfill the role of his mom.

365
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:12.000
Christina Anderson: Not so much that because I wish I didn't have to be that way.

366
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.030
Christina Anderson: I

367
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.930
Christina Anderson: Try and make them more independent what

368
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:28.620
Christina Anderson: I mean, he's, he got an SSI for the wrong reasons to get easy money, but at the same time you did have a

369
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.890
Christina Anderson: He almost was beat to death by bats and I think his head injuries affected him to

370
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.070
Richelle Direny: When he got in a fight.

371
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:45.000
Christina Anderson: Yeah, he was walking and you know he was in that stupid game life back in the day and

372
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:54.270
Christina Anderson: He was all you know high on pills, one day and I he doesn't even know what happened he still doesn't know who did it, and

373
00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:04.170
Christina Anderson: So I guess he got SSI off of severe post traumatic stress and all this geeky can't function and outside and blah, blah, blah.

374
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.700
Christina Anderson: Even though he

375
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.080
And

376
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:17.250
Christina Anderson: But um but yeah they beat him with that's really hard, like they said if he wasn't so filled out on Danny's that he probably would have died because it

377
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.300
Christina Anderson: Did something as blood or I forgot what you said, but um yeah he was he was almost beat to death and

378
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.390
Christina Anderson: Numerous hits to the head.

379
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.190
Christina Anderson: Um,

380
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.520
Christina Anderson: But

381
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:41.490
Christina Anderson: Um, but yeah, no, I would really like to break free of this role always have to do everything.

382
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:50.940
Christina Anderson: But I'm just scared because I mean I love him. I have love for him. I just don't want to see him up there.

383
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.220
Richelle Direny: Are you in love with a few different things.

384
00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.220
Richelle Direny: The it's all that two completely different things.

385
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.090
Richelle Direny: I love a whole lot of people. Right. And what a whole nother thing.

386
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.790
Richelle Direny: Yeah, understand I'm saying

387
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:23.760
Richelle Direny: Then the other part of it is, do you feel that the relationship is more of a hindrance than it is beneficial for you. Thank you. You feel like it's holding you back from moving forward in all aspects of your life.

388
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:39.360
Richelle Direny: Do you feel somewhat stifled. Or do you feel like you know you want to move. I mean, you want to move forward your things that dreams and aspirations, you have, but there's a part of the relationship that's kind of suffocating

389
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:40.830
Yeah.

390
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.090
Richelle Direny: Well, sounds like I'm naming a few sources of your anxiety.

391
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:45.600
Right.

392
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.220
Christina Anderson: Now I always knew that was a part of big part of it.

393
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.450
Christina Anderson: It's just, he certainly been in the picture for so long. And I've had it for so long. So, I mean, I knew that was

394
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:10.560
Christina Anderson: And because it but a part of me. I'm like, still wants to see it work, but it's just been so much drama so much

395
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:25.290
Christina Anderson: Pain and it's just like, I'd rather be a single I almost want to be a single mother. Now I told him I don't, I don't want to man ever again. No, I want to be like my mom. I'll start dating one she's out of the house.

396
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:36.450
Richelle Direny: And so it's, it sounds. It doesn't sound that necessarily you want to be a single mom, again, I think you just want to change your circumstances.

397
00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:37.620
Christina Anderson: Right.

398
00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:44.160
Richelle Direny: What you're feeling and going through is what a lot of women, both for how long you guys been together.

399
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.470
Christina Anderson: Um,

400
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.220
Christina Anderson: Basically

401
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.000
Christina Anderson: The middle of 2016. I mean, we were only together like a month or two, and we can see her.

402
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:12.420
Richelle Direny: Okay, so it's not like you've not been together a whole long time so it's still that feeling of guilt is was carrying a relationship but guilt is is going to eventually make you become resentful.

403
00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:13.800
Christina Anderson: Uh huh.

404
00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:24.870
Richelle Direny: You understand, and you have to really think like that, you'll want to make you resent him over, over the years, because then the choices you make.

405
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:42.750
Richelle Direny: All in the name of feeling bad about his situation, you will then start blaming him for the decisions you make. Which would then become unfair to him because they were your choices. There were your decisions. The the

406
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:51.090
Richelle Direny: The, to some degree, the only obligation, you have in life right now is to her.

407
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.160
Christina Anderson: Into your soul.

408
00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:02.160
Richelle Direny: It sounds bad. It sounds horrible. But that's really the only true obligation, but I think it is, um,

409
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:05.490
You

410
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:19.950
Richelle Direny: You have to really think outside of the fact that for years you've had anxiety has your anxiety increased more since you've been in this relationship. And since you're in the circumstance that you're in.

411
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.060
Christina Anderson: I'm

412
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.590
Christina Anderson: I think so.

413
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.610
Christina Anderson: I mean, it's hard to say.

414
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.540
Christina Anderson: It's because it's just

415
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:54.660
Christina Anderson: A different anxiety than what I normally had it was more of how she going to act today. How's he gonna will move it to be and not so much. All my

416
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:02.160
Christina Anderson: What do I have to get done. I'm not doing enough in life, and that this, this, and that it's more like what type of emergency and today.

417
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.770
Christina Anderson: So your

418
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.550
Richelle Direny: Body's always going to be created based on your current situation and circumstance.

419
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:23.910
Richelle Direny: It's not always the same. It anxiousness comes with different in the anxiousness comes with I got to go to the doctor. They took a blood test. Now, I'm like, God was the result I am i dying or is it going to tell you understand anxiety comes with different situation circumstance.

420
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.100
Richelle Direny: Wall question is

421
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:38.160
Richelle Direny: Right now, you feel like you know what my Medicare my anxiety medication is not working. And I find that I'm popping it more that I'm in this relationship simply

422
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.140
Richelle Direny: Relationship comes with. Yes. Think about that.

423
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.720
Richelle Direny: Do you find that

424
00:45:47.400 --> 00:46:04.140
Richelle Direny: You're increasing your doses of your Suboxone because you're having the cravings, or what have you, based on your current relationship that's when I talk about the foundation and the source of what you're thinking and feeling what is creating that what is making that company.

425
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:05.970
Christina Anderson: Right.

426
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.720
Christina Anderson: And yeah, I mean,

427
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:25.770
Christina Anderson: Yeah, I guess, I guess it has been because even the pills got worse when I got with him at first, then I had to stop and then I go back on it again because I was just always

428
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:39.960
Christina Anderson: Trying to get away from it all. And so, I mean, yeah, I think it has been more so. But I don't find myself like popping anything more than I should. Um,

429
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.260
Christina Anderson: I still have a little bit of a hold on it.

430
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.300
Christina Anderson: I'm

431
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:54.390
Christina Anderson: Never had thoughts of, you know, let me just take another one, but I never do.

432
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.050
Richelle Direny: You said you have thought

433
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.040
Christina Anderson: I mean, yeah, there's been times when I'll let me take an extra two bags when I'm stressed or you know whatever but

434
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.330
Christina Anderson: I mean, then I'm going to go a day without it. So I don't I don't end up doing it. I mean,

435
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.550
Christina Anderson: So, I still have, like, you know, bit of control on that.

436
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:31.260
Christina Anderson: Then there's the days where I he could be stressing me out completely. And I just keep myself busy enough and I forget to take the thing that day.

437
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.650
Christina Anderson: So I don't know, it's always different. It's

438
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:46.230
Richelle Direny: It's how your mind thinks of it and the end of it all, how your mind thinks of it. It's not don't over process it and don't overthink it.

439
00:47:46.740 --> 00:48:05.880
Richelle Direny: It's looking at it like the end this is the key to any whether it's your relationship, whether it's work whether the matter what the circumstance is if there is something that's making you feel like I need to do this to get away from it. That's your problem.

440
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.320
Richelle Direny: And that is

441
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.990
Richelle Direny: That is your, your tune

442
00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:24.120
Richelle Direny: If it's making you feel in think I need to get away. I needed to this and I need to do that, then this may be an issue because the source of your problem, you understand

443
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:24.900
Christina Anderson: That

444
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.520
Richelle Direny: Kind of house. So when I look at an addiction. I look at you get a

445
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:39.840
Richelle Direny: Good deal of numbing a certain emotion or feeling that's got addicted to is the idea if I'm

446
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:57.480
Richelle Direny: If I drink an excessive amount of alcohol. What does it do it takes me kind of it out of my out of body work puts me to sleep. I don't have your thinking that moment, if I take any type of drug. I'm not doing it because, oh boy, this tastes like straight up sugar.

447
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:10.230
Richelle Direny: Good stuff. No, I'm doing it because I know the end result is going to numb the thoughts and the feelings and the emotion of what is so overwhelming to me right now.

448
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.940
Richelle Direny: I just stopped.

449
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:21.780
Richelle Direny: When you get addicted to what it does, it takes you away from what you're feeling in your thinking.

450
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:36.420
Richelle Direny: And therefore once you identify what is causing me a tremendous amount of courage or our discomfort, whatever is causing me that discomfort. I need to remove it.

451
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.300
Richelle Direny: If you wear a size.

452
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.190
Richelle Direny: I don't know if this happened to you, but after you had your daughter. For some people they they gain a whole shoe size.

453
00:49:49.500 --> 00:50:01.050
Richelle Direny: And so if you were a size six. But then after you had your child. You were now we are so you notice that, oh boy, this five six is a bit tight, are you going to keep doing it, or are you going to get rid of it.

454
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:14.820
Richelle Direny: But oftentimes what we do instead of getting rid of the problem that we've just identified we find a way around it. Just get rid of the problem is you can't go get a new one.

455
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:27.750
Richelle Direny: We don't get our mind doesn't compute it like that. Our mind just find a way to get a temporary fix. So what do we do, we go get a shoe plank and try to white know you'll need a widening it's going to come back.

456
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.920
Christina Anderson: Just

457
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.500
Richelle Direny: Get rid of the source of your issue is

458
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.870
Richelle Direny: That muscle discomfort.

459
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:40.050
Richelle Direny: Get don't find something to give you a temporary fix find a permanent solution.

460
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.070
Richelle Direny: Now I'm not telling you to go get reinforcement, not by no means

461
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:53.160
Richelle Direny: But I'm saying identify what's creating the discomfort that is repeat

462
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.600
Christina Anderson: Right.

463
00:50:54.870 --> 00:51:02.340
Richelle Direny: That. That's all I'm saying. Think about identify what are those things that causing the discomfort. That's what we try to work through

464
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:15.420
Richelle Direny: And like I said, you know, you have to, I encourage it whether it's you check in. Once a month for session to just kind of address certain things in group therapy. It's not going to get so personalized

465
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:22.890
Richelle Direny: Right. Um, but it's definitely something to think about. And I definitely encourage it while you're on this medication.

466
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.900
Richelle Direny: Okay. And I would encourage you to call
