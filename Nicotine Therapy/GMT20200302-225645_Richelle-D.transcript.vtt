156
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:53.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and then the housing the housing your case workers working with you on. But if you sell a goal for yourself. At least it encourages you and it gives you motivation, all that your successes going forward.

157
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.270
Richelle Direny: So,

158
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.110

160
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:27.960
Not

161
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.490
zachariah Giffin: Thing.

162
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.000

163
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:47.250

164
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.800

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.650
Richelle Direny: When I was

166
00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:10.980

167
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:19.230

168
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:35.850
Richelle Direny: That you can jot down some things that you want to discuss with her or some goals that you have. So at least she knows what you plan on doing or what you would like to do, and she can set realistic goals with you that, you know, so that you're successful

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.480

286
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:20.790
zachariah Giffin: Um, I don't know, because it's like reading a book you're waiting for the next thing. Big thing to happen. So you're focused on it.

287
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:35.130
zachariah Giffin: Like when you're reading a book and you're really getting into it. You can't put the book down and stop reading it because you want to know what happens next. So that's how it is with me when I'm watching a series on TV. I keep watching it, because I want to know what happens.

288
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.110

301
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:16.560
Richelle Direny: Okay. Well, that's a good thing. That's a good thing. So it seems like taking the shot. It's been a good thing for you.

302
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:19.800
Yeah.

303
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.730
Richelle Direny: Okay, well,

304
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:40.440
Richelle Direny: Just continue with. I mean, the path that you're on. And you know, I think if you let her said I will definitely suggest

305
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:52.920
Richelle Direny: That you write down just kind of take notes as to some of the things that when you meet with your concert. What you want to discuss with her. What you want to go over with her and

306
00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.450
Richelle Direny: You know, it leaves you have instead of goal, you know, with the school.

307
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:09.600
Richelle Direny: You said maybe a six month goal and what does that goal in six consists of its identity identifying what is it that

308
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.430
zachariah Giffin: To the timeframe, you can just

309
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:20.010
Richelle Direny: Write the letter to submit the letter. I'm getting the car you've already gotten one check you're saving up all the fear of money.

310
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:28.950
Richelle Direny: So you're being intentional about that you're meeting with the case manager. She's going to help you with getting things squared away for you to be able to

311
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.920
Richelle Direny: Get your apartment.

312
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:34.560
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

313
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:42.600
Richelle Direny: Housing situated. So the first thing, as you said, the first thing is that you want to get the first goal for you is getting your car right

314
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.500
zachariah Giffin: Um, yeah.

315
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.160
Richelle Direny: Okay. Then the next goal is

316
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.940
zachariah Giffin: Fine. After that, after that it will be finding a job.

317
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.950
Richelle Direny: Okay. Yeah, because you need to be able to sustain and pay for the car and everything else.

318
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:06.150
Richelle Direny: Know what else the next goal after that was what getting the apartment.

319
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:11.760
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

320
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:29.880
zachariah Giffin: After it because after I become financially stable. I want to get an apartment that I can get on the list where it goes by my income and I can get an apartment before I become financially stable because they go by your income.

321
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.060
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so I mean I think that you're

322
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.470
Richelle Direny: You're on the right path. I think the last thing.

323
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:46.860
