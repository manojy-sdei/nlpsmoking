daniel hufford: Yeah, they are. Dr. G.

149
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.230
daniel hufford: Christina and my psychotherapist lady I forget her name.

150
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:51.000
Jodi Dumler: Okay. Then there's for I don't know how you have for but somehow because you the case manager when I'm asking about is a lot of a lot of places that do like they're the mental health clinics. A lot of them have somebody that can come out to your house.

151
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.490
daniel hufford: Or

152
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.850
Jodi Dumler: Or do transportation or assistance, some of that stuff.

153
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:05.490
daniel hufford: She met Christina, which is something about so she has the drive and I think she did say, yeah, I can go places for Uber. I don't know if we're talking about

154
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.710
daniel hufford: Different things

155
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:15.120
Jodi Dumler: So it could be her, she could be the case management or here, or whatever she could be good. That's, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah, it would be good.

156
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:26.070
Jodi Dumler: Okay, so that in that case, though, since you, you're probably having a therapist, there is, I probably can't see you for individual too often, but I wasn't going to anyway because I want you to group to with us. So that'll be okay.

157
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.090
daniel hufford: I like the individuals are good.

158
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.010
Jodi Dumler: I know, I know you do by

159
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.920
Jodi Dumler: Group, I know you do. But I also your insurance, you want to make sure your insurance pays for your stuff.

160
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.130
daniel hufford: Yeah okay all right here. Yeah.

161
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.520
Jodi Dumler: Overlapping hit something and run into something where it's charging you

162
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:53.160
Jodi Dumler: So you'll, you'll have there'll be more for sure that i mean if they're gonna hit go pay group if they've been paying group so

163
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.420
Jodi Dumler: I don't want you to end up with a bill for anything. You don't need a bill for

164
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.220
daniel hufford: I got a wall, Bill. Yeah.

165
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.030
Jodi Dumler: That's why I don't do individuals. Very often with people in Michigan is because of that.

166
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.550
daniel hufford: How could they charge you.

167
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.600
Jodi Dumler: Sometimes, depending on what you've got going on, they'll, they'll charge

168
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.880
daniel hufford: They won't pay for your individualized too much on your plate, then start charging me well.

169
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:27.570
Jodi Dumler: Mostly they for you for your sake, because you have mental health. They can look I could, I can see you individually once in a while, but if you're seeing a mental health place like there.

170
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.070
Jodi Dumler: Then they'll might say it's a duplicate. And so then they might not want to pay for one, so I don't want to do that.

171
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.780
daniel hufford: All right. Gotcha.

172
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.380
Jodi Dumler: But well, so that's why groups better, even though you don't like it, because it'll get covered and then I can keep seeing you every month for sure.

173
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:48.390
daniel hufford: Like I heard they were like, we got a Suboxone clinic. Yes, it knows what I'm dealing with right now at all unless it up.

174
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:59.130
daniel hufford: Like my therapist to let my doctor, everything's cool. Once in a while I mess up and I gotta go take a doe urine or blood test, but that's fine.

175
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:09.210
daniel hufford: That had bad luck with Southwest mental health. I mean, it's like they give you know window you miss an appointment you miss an appointment. I mean,

176
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:16.590
daniel hufford: It's crazy, like I missed to get my blood pressure, I switched over my primary care doctor over here and

177
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.570
daniel hufford: I missed the date because I had to go, what was it,

178
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.540
daniel hufford: Had to do something when it was all I had to see my sister and give her papers for

179
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.870
daniel hufford: One main financial the full out

180
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:41.850
daniel hufford: And it was at the same time, I can see her as the same time my doctor's appointment was into RE scheduled me was 18 February 18 I believe it is

181
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.740
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, I'm sure.

182
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.360
daniel hufford: Well, so

268
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:25.320

269
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.820

274
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.390
Jodi Dumler: I'm wondering

275
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:24.510
Jodi Dumler: Looks like they might be right in a week script to start with that the pharmacy would like. So let me see. I'm not seeing that in here. So maybe that does need to be entered and maybe we're actually just needing to enter that in. So let me

276
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.020
Try one more time together.

Jodi Dumler: Is Maria still working at all ever

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.850
Jodi Dumler: Okay, do you have that little bit of money come in every in every once in a while.

312
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:49.770
Jodi Dumler: Because you never you guys don't have any she's not on a disability or anything either. So you don't have. Do you have any money consistently coming in for you guys.

313
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.220
Jason short: Know, okay.

314
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.160
Okay.

Jodi Dumler: And where are you guys living now where's your new place that

316
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.450
Jason short: Long

317
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:47.040
Jodi Dumler: So there's really not anything. So it's really same pool of work and all of that. It's about the same. So there's nothing that you see as potential minimal in, you know, minimal hours going forward. That might be an option. I know you said you're going to think about work, but you don't know

318
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.370
Jason short: I really, I could find somebody that would just let me have a local forum or something.

319
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.840
Jodi Dumler: Do you guys get food stamps for firm for food and things like that, then

320
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.960
Jason short: Yeah, she just love Inside Sales. Okay.

321
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.390
That's good.

322
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.540
Jodi Dumler: I guess for what I want to know. Jason is

323
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.470
Jodi Dumler: Is if you get on your medicine and nothing changes.

324
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.600
Jodi Dumler: I don't know, I guess, quality of life. Why are you getting real

325
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.300
Jason short: Okay.

326
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:11.310
Jodi Dumler: You're kind of used to you kind of used to it at this point. So as long as the medications consistent, you're pretty used to your day to day

327
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.320
Jason short: Yeah.

328
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.340
Jodi Dumler: Well, I can't, I can't promise you it's going to be done.

329
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.750
Jodi Dumler: Today, because I'm not getting a response. Yet, um,

330
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.470
Jodi Dumler: And I don't know.

331
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:32.790
Jodi Dumler: I don't know if I'm guessing the holdup is on the pharmacy side, but I can't tell 100%

332
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:47.640
Jodi Dumler: But they did visit with you. So the plan, right, is that as soon as the pharmacy approves that you'll get the medication and then you'll just have to consistently do the testing and things to

333
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.590
Jodi Dumler: You know, just to show once you're back on. Is that kind of the plan.

334
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.220
Jason short: Yeah, okay.

335
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:10.530
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, and to make sure you get your drug. Did they work with you. They said, kind of some of the issue that they ran into. And I think why everything fell apart partially is that we just didn't have much for drug tests on you, um,

336
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:18.150
Jodi Dumler: Do we have. Do they have it fixed. So there's gonna be a good address that it's going to come to and you're going to get it. Now I know we've had issues in the past.

337
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.440
Jason short: Oh, how old your mama.

338
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.440
Jason short: Your mama true. Okay.

339
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.680

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.500
Jodi Dumler: Okay.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.270
Jodi Dumler: So it looks like

343
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.100
Jodi Dumler: It looks like at this

344
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.670
Point.

345
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:37.980

Jason short: Would look at it.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.180
