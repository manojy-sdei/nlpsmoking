76
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.200
Aaron Mcmanis: Needless to say, it took my life in a bad way.

77
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:32.070
Aaron Mcmanis: When I tried to get in therapy. By that time, I was highly addicted and couldn't do anything couldn't function or anything without it.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.860
Aaron Mcmanis: That's what started it all.

82
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.160
Aaron Mcmanis: oxycodone oxy cotton.

83
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.420
Aaron Mcmanis: Back then, they were just hand out anything

84
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.380
Yeah.

85
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.790
Aaron Mcmanis: So I ended up on a lot of medication.

86
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.570
Aaron Mcmanis: They put me on methadone to take me off of that. And that actually

87
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.090
Aaron Mcmanis: Just made things worse.

88
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:20.790
Aaron Mcmanis: So when I came back up here. I just started trying to get away from pain medication.

89
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:34.680
Aaron Mcmanis: And I can punch the ladies on Suboxone or still be text. I can at least go to work and do normal based thing where I couldn't even do that on pain medication.

90
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.240
Aaron Mcmanis: I got into legal troubles lot of

91
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.070

Aaron Mcmanis: Ended up in jail a lot

93
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.140
Aaron Mcmanis: I ended up with some serious charges.

94
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.210
Aaron Mcmanis: Almost ended up with a life sentence over

95
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.670
Aaron Mcmanis: Then got real bad.

96
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.410
Aaron Mcmanis: Luck for got away from all the masks and came up here trying to change.

97
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.120
Natalie Austin: So then when he came up here. What did you kind of two years ago. You came up here.

98
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.370
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, couple years ago.

99
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.140
Natalie Austin: Did you still have neck pain and back pain.

100
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.930
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, I still deal with it like on a day to day basis. But I mean,

101
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.080
Aaron Mcmanis: At least I can function on

102
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:38.700
Aaron Mcmanis: The

103
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.790
Natalie Austin: Nice thing about Suboxone is it works for pain to

104
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.710
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, right.

105
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.310
Natalie Austin: On

106
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.150

Aaron Mcmanis: I've been on both

108
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.550
Natalie Austin: I mean, they either big motion be covered by your insurance, so shouldn't matter right

109
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.660
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, yeah, that's what. Well, the thing is,

110
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.970
Aaron Mcmanis: My insurance don't want to pay for Suboxone

111
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.060
Aaron Mcmanis: And Sunday.

112
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:25.650
Aaron Mcmanis: Last Sunday text is way cheaper if they won't pay for him. I can actually pay out of pocket. I can afford to pay for the prescription if my insurance decides not to pay for

113
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.990
Natalie Austin: Okay, what were you

114
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.420
Natalie Austin: What were you taking

115
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.360
Aaron Mcmanis: Two eight milligrams a day.

116
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.710
Okay.

117
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.080
Natalie Austin: And your prescription still good right now because you just got one.

118
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.990
Aaron Mcmanis: today would be the day I will go back to the other doctor

Aaron Mcmanis: The doctor is Levi Harper.

124
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.200
Okay.

125
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.050
Natalie Austin: You let them know you're not coming back or yeah

126
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.430
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, I was.

127
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:40.770
Aaron Mcmanis: Parents that they told me they were gonna let me know about what the interest was going to do. And then I was going to call them after this and let them know that I was changing doctors

128
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.070
Natalie Austin: And they will they are cash only probably huh

129
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.420
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah.

130
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.460
Natalie Austin: Yeah, most of the clinics are

131
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.750
Natalie Austin: Think we're the only I think we're the only company that actually takes insurance worse, you know,

132
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.510
Natalie Austin: That's why it's helpful. Yeah, we try to help people.

133
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.330
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, that's a big difference from a couple of hundred a month just for the doctor part

134
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.590
Natalie Austin: But I got

135
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.150
Aaron Mcmanis: I got

136
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.730
Aaron Mcmanis: thousands and thousand dollar bills for just for the drug test.

137
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.030
Aaron Mcmanis: It's 1000 each month just

138
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.380
Aaron Mcmanis: Yeah, just for a simple drug tests that they have lab tested every month.

139
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.350
Aaron Mcmanis: No, that's ridiculous.

140
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:34.050
Natalie Austin: And then how much was your how much where you think you said $600 a month for everything else.

141
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.850
Aaron Mcmanis: Right, you know,

142
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:36.870
We

143
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:58.860
Aaron Mcmanis: Charge depending on where you go, what pharmacy, they can charge you up to $8 apiece. So that's quite a bit for 500 just right there. But you're paying the doctor 200 a month. So yeah, six 700 bucks a month plus your drug test is 1000 so

144
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.140
Natalie Austin: Yeah. It's insanity.

145
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.890
Aaron Mcmanis: I can't do it anymore.

146
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.320
Natalie Austin: No, I'm glad you came to us.

147
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:08.850

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:30.210
Natalie Austin: And then every Thursday or Monday, you can choose whether you are. Do you want to come next Monday. I guess we could do that too.

151
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.830

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.140
Aaron Mcmanis: I don't know.

535
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.760

536
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.900
Natalie Austin: Like I did when they were the wrong number down

547
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.340

608
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.340

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.940
Aaron Mcmanis: Did they send it now today.

610
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:10.920

614
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.670

615
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.220
Natalie Austin: Just, you know, show up there and get it done.

616
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:36.840
All right.

620
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.270

Natalie Austin: It again that should be covered by insurance. We don't like I don't see them charging anybody for that but that should be

625
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:12.570
Natalie Austin: You can ask whenever you get a call back in and talk to Ariana asked her about that, but I think it should be covered.

626
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.090
Natalie Austin: She's, she's probably searching your benefits right now. So whenever you get on, let me see.
