00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:24.060
Helena Rouhe: So, this is this man individual session with Cassidy Wheeler and she did not show up for IoT eating disorder program. Yes, or Monday or Tuesday of this week, claiming that she had a migraine. She did communicate with me via email, stating that

2
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.070
Helena Rouhe: She was going to try and get a hold of the Father, and see if he could join chat session today in order to gain some additional support for her dietary needs.

3
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:52.110
Helena Rouhe: But then stated to me that her father was not available to meet today. So then I said, Okay, well I plan on seeing you on Wednesday. And we can further discuss and so we can you know I essentially confirm session with her.

4
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
Helena Rouhe: YESTERDAY, ACTUALLY, THIS MORNING, but you know she

5
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.950
Helena Rouhe: And in the email correspondence led me to believe that she's supposed to be making session. She has been in program with us. Now, a couple of weeks, so I am not going to ask Jacob to follow up.

6
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:21.840
Helena Rouhe: With her as far as making individual sessions. So hopefully she will show up today. If she doesn't, then I'm going to recommend a higher level of care because he is struggling and we need to make sure that we address that.

7
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.340
Helena Rouhe: Hello.

8
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.900
Hey,

9
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.330
Helena Rouhe: How are you feeling

10
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.750
kassidy wheeler: All right.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.510
kassidy wheeler: Like gone just tired.

12
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.040
Helena Rouhe: Do you have a history of migraine.

13
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.500
kassidy wheeler: Um, yeah.

14
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.030
kassidy wheeler: About like

15
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.200
kassidy wheeler: Let's say like once a month.

16
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.220
Helena Rouhe: That related to your cycle.

17
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.380
kassidy wheeler: Um,

18
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.660
kassidy wheeler: Having no idea

19
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.850
Helena Rouhe: Or you don't necessarily have a notice of a pattern of it.

20
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.390
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, no, not really. Okay.

21
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.270
Helena Rouhe: And so when did you first start having migraines.

22
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.930
kassidy wheeler: Likes

23
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.700
kassidy wheeler: 18 think two years ago.

24
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.230
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And did you ever see a medical practitioner forum or do you ever talk to a doctor about it.

25
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.570
kassidy wheeler: No, um,

26
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:42.870
kassidy wheeler: It's nice. My like mom gets them and sisters all get that. So it's kind of like normal.

27
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.580
Helena Rouhe: They have a family history.

28
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.670
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, okay. And so they're the ones who kind of identify this, this is what's going on for you.

29
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.080
Yeah.

30
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.560
Helena Rouhe: And do they take any medicine or what do they do for their for when they experienced this.

31
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.200
kassidy wheeler: They usually take

32
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.670
kassidy wheeler: Like excedrin

33
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.650
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

34
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:19.920
Helena Rouhe: So I'm going to strongly recommend that you see a medical provider about this and that you get follow up on this because there's all kinds of medications out there and different things that might be helpful.

35
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:30.000
Helena Rouhe: And I would suggest that you see an OB GYN because there's likely hormonal connection.

36
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.250
Helena Rouhe: Etc. Maybe not going to be the best option for you.

37
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.510
kassidy wheeler: Mm hmm.

38
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.690
Helena Rouhe: They can also be a bit of an appetite suppressant.

39
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.600
Helena Rouhe: So another reason for it to not be

40
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.290
Helena Rouhe: You know, maybe, you know, some other options.

41
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.220
Yeah.

42
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.990
Helena Rouhe: So when you have a migraine. What is the typical course of it. How long does it typically last

43
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.780
kassidy wheeler: Usually it's only

44
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.690
kassidy wheeler: About a day.

45
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.370
kassidy wheeler: Um,

46
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.900
kassidy wheeler: But this one just lasted longer than usual usually like with

47
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.300
kassidy wheeler: Sleep like hopes it to go away.

48
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.240

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.100

kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

54
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:35.670
Helena Rouhe: Typically, if we stay hydrated and have decent food then that can also help with

55
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.000
Helena Rouhe: Your food and hydration been like a couple of days.

kassidy wheeler: I canna I just have to, like, make it work and that

125
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:39.570
kassidy wheeler: I can't like run away from my problems and like he's lived his life longer so he knows what's best and

126
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:55.590
kassidy wheeler: Um, and then trying, he kind of. He's like, Oh, like I have struggles to like yours, my manifest as an eating disorder but like everyone like struggles with things and you have to just like

127
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.110
kassidy wheeler: Like

128
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.470
kassidy wheeler: Get through it and

129
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.380
kassidy wheeler: Then I like you're just being like

130
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:33.690
kassidy wheeler: Feeling wasn't listening. And I like started having a panic attack as a crying. It was a dad. I feel like you're not like listening to me. Um, any like raise his voice. He's like, No, you're not listening to me and just all the stuff just going off and then, sir, talking about like

131
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:58.020
kassidy wheeler: Just randomly is like. And when I picked you up from treatment. You just got on your phone. So that means like you don't have a social life. And I think you probably addicted to your phone and like, don't hang out with people. And I was like, like what is that to do with anything but um

132
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.820
kassidy wheeler: It was just bad is really bad.

133
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.670
kassidy wheeler: And I

134
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.450
Helena Rouhe: Don't think that's going to be supportive of paying more money for you to do.

135
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:18.150
kassidy wheeler: I don't think so either. And another thing is like we and he's like, why do you

136
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:29.430
kassidy wheeler: Think why do you think we need a therapist. We can just talk about stuff like we are right now. We don't need a therapist to talk about stuff that was like, well,

137
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:46.530
kassidy wheeler: Kind of do like it goes like this. It doesn't get anywhere you know and like I feel safer with a therapist to talk about our stuff, but it's

138
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.300
kassidy wheeler: A lot

139
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:58.650
Helena Rouhe: Do you have other options in the family to help you if you go back to treatment in order to help the CO pays or whatever needs to happen.

140
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.990
Helena Rouhe: If you go back to a higher level of care.

141
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.050
kassidy wheeler: I've been talking to my mom.

142
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.430
kassidy wheeler: About it a little bit and

143
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.490
kassidy wheeler: I feel like she could help me figure something out. Um,

144
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.690
kassidy wheeler: Hopefully,

145
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.170
kassidy wheeler: She doesn't have a lot of money.

146
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:34.290
Helena Rouhe: Do you have a contact at rosewood or from the Capri program when you were there before somebody if you, you know, felt like you needed to go back in, or do you want to

147
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.430
Helena Rouhe: Start to Kenny.

148
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.750
Helena Rouhe: So I can also have Jacob from our program, reach out to them and kind of start that process, but

149
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.640
Helena Rouhe: I need you to stay in program with us until you transfer

150
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.660
Helena Rouhe: So I understand that you weren't in group on Monday, as well as

151
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.400
Helena Rouhe: Tuesday. And I understand that.

152
00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:02.850
Helena Rouhe: In part that was because of the migraine, but I'm also wondering if maybe part of us just trying to get mentally ready for the next thing. And so you're kind of just

153
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.340
Helena Rouhe: Not wanting to participate in group. Is there any truth to that or

154
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.440
kassidy wheeler: Oh no, I

155
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.230
kassidy wheeler: Really like wasn't

156
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.870
kassidy wheeler: Feeling good.

157
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:17.880
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

158
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.010
Okay.

159
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.570
Helena Rouhe: Well, I need you to keep participating in our program.

160
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.960
Helena Rouhe: Which means going to group. So you definitely need to go tomorrow.

161
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.610
Helena Rouhe: Yes, and

162
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:47.550
Helena Rouhe: And we need to, if you are going to transition back to a higher level of care. I need to have you be part of our process and and have us connected to them. And I want to make sure that you know everything squared away. I don't want to just assume that it's all good and that you're fine.

163
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.450
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

164
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:54.090
Helena Rouhe: I want to make sure that if you make that transition that we're a part of that transition so that I know you've landed safely.

165
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.880
Helena Rouhe: The next destination. Okay.

166
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:14.340
Helena Rouhe: I, you know, we talked about this last week, I am concerned about i i agree i think you need a you need to have more stabilization. But there still is going to be. And then what when you discharge.

167
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:22.110
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so you're going to need to be thinking about what is life going to look like in, you know, the next six months.

168
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.300
Helena Rouhe: Once you stabilized. Is there some other kind of

169
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:36.780
Helena Rouhe: House that they have that maybe you can say a part of the program there, or do they have a different kind of recommendation for you.

170
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:50.370
Helena Rouhe: So that you have the support that you need in your immediate space in order for you to maintain your meal plan and help you continue to work through the anxiety that you experience the results of your behavior.

171
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.570
kassidy wheeler: Mm hmm.

172
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.620
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

173
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.690
kassidy wheeler: Kate was kind of talking to me about that earlier, too.

174
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:10.170
kassidy wheeler: And I, I know there is another

175
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.830
kassidy wheeler: Place that I've been thinking about I'm

176
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.560
kassidy wheeler: Called Marisol and it's

177
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:31.440
Helena Rouhe: They have a year long step down outpatient type program that we're talking about. It's kind of like a house where you just live with other people, they just kind of check in on you type thing.

178
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.080
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, I have a

179
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:44.040
kassidy wheeler: Friend that's there right now. Actually, and I was asking her about it and there's still like open and like accepting

180
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.840
kassidy wheeler: People and everything.

181
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.330
kassidy wheeler: Well, that might be a good option to

182
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:58.770
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so do you want to see if you can follow up with both of those programs in the morning and and and then I can also have Jacob follow up.

183
00:21:59.550 --> 00:21:59.970
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

184
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.450
Helena Rouhe: So that we can kind of tag team this and see what we come up with

185
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:13.980
Helena Rouhe: Yes. Okay. Can you lead tomorrow when you check into virtual clinic. Can you let them know who you make contact with that miracle.

186
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.410
Helena Rouhe: That's

187
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.510
Helena Rouhe: That's the one in Southern California. Right. That's the kind of Newport area.

188
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.700
kassidy wheeler: Where did they know almost one here.

189
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.900
Okay.

190
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:30.000
Helena Rouhe: Okay. That's right. Alright, so there's one close by. Yeah.

191
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:39.510
Helena Rouhe: Okay, would you still be able to see your mom and your sisters and all of that. Would that be closer to them or further away or

192
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.460
kassidy wheeler: Almost farther away.

193
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.090
Helena Rouhe: Teasing that's going to be a challenge.

194
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.460
kassidy wheeler: No.

195
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.660
kassidy wheeler: Exam bye environment. Yeah.

196
00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:09.390
Helena Rouhe: Alright, well, we are human beings that learn by doing. You know, until you're in a situation, you don't really know what the reality of it is. So I think the situation tells you what you need in order for you to stay healthy and safe at this time in your life.

197
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.690
Helena Rouhe: Now I'm sure your dad and everybody was well meaning when they tried to set this up but

198
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.530
Helena Rouhe: Does not appear to be working now.

199
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.820
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

200
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.150
Yeah.

201
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:36.450
Helena Rouhe: So tomorrow, you're going to reach out to Marisol and rosewood the Capri program and see what you come up with stay in contact with the mom kind of let her know what you come up with all that Jacob in the fall through. Now,

202
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.030
Helena Rouhe: As the same program with us. How do you want to manage this upcoming weekend.

203
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.770
kassidy wheeler: I don't know.

204
00:23:55.050 --> 00:24:03.300
Helena Rouhe: Well, last week we talked about being accountable to your mom and your sisters when you when you didn't have your friend around. Can you up that ante a little bit

205
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.830
Helena Rouhe: They around maybe you guys can visit each other a little bit this weekend.

206
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.810
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, I can see

207
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.440
kassidy wheeler: Them every day. Sure. My sisters

208
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.960
kassidy wheeler: Don't yeah I think they don't. I don't think they have anything going on.

209
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:34.140
Helena Rouhe: Because I think you're going to need the support more now than ever. Right, while you're in this transitional period and you are working to kind of make stuff happen you're going to make you need to make sure you have that additional support.

210
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.160
Yeah.

211
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:37.830
Helena Rouhe: Now,

212
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:44.490
Helena Rouhe: What, if anything, needs to be done to kind of mitigate the situation with dad.

213
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:54.180
Helena Rouhe: If you end up making a connection with the program and discovering that you're going to transition. How do you want to handle that with him.

214
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:56.940
kassidy wheeler: Um,

215
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.890
kassidy wheeler: I think maybe

216
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.420
kassidy wheeler: I could just kind of bring it up.

217
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.750
kassidy wheeler: Tonight, and like see

218
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.440
kassidy wheeler: What do you like

219
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.910
Helena Rouhe: I don't think that's a good idea.

220
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:29.010
Helena Rouhe: I think you need to have a plan in place that it's actually going to happen and then just kind of let him know because he's already been very clear with you that he wants to just suck it up.

221
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.020
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, right. So that that opinion is not going to change.

222
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.130
Yeah.

223
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:43.530
Helena Rouhe: So if you're seeking out any kind of support or advice from him. That's going to be other than suck it up. It's not going to go well.

224
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.600
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, right.

225
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.740
Mm hmm.

226
00:25:47.760 --> 00:26:01.140
Helena Rouhe: So I would advocate for you that you you become proactive about your plan you work on making this happen with Marisol and or rosewood you talk to your mom you keep your mom in the loop.

227
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.410
Helena Rouhe: And hopefully everyone can figure out something that's going to make that work. And once you have the plan in place.

228
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:19.020
Helena Rouhe: You let your dad know what's going on. It would be nice if you could involve him. It would be nice if he could be a part of the process, but it doesn't sound like that's going to be something that's going to go well.

229
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:25.920
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, because he has his own kind of thoughts about what needs to happen and I think

230
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.640
Helena Rouhe: That comes from his perspective about therapy and services and, you know,

231
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.330
Helena Rouhe: It's a little bit of just rub some dirt on it and make it go away. They'll all be better.

232
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:51.480
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Yeah. So I think you need to be the one who's proactive. This isn't about anybody else. Following up on this. You're the one who really needs to set this up so that you can make sure it happens and go through it.

233
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:56.520
Helena Rouhe: Do you think you're going to be able to work through this while you're dealing with the residuals of this migraine.

234
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.680
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

235
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:09.300
Helena Rouhe: Because this isn't something I want you to push off. You know, it's Wednesday night. I want to make sure you make some contacts and really see what you can get accomplished by the end of the week.

236
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.130
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. By Friday afternoon. It would be great if you had some sort of plan in place.

237
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.770
Helena Rouhe: Or at least the workings of a plan.

238
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.200
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, okay.

239
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:27.990
Helena Rouhe: Do you think you could email me that and give me a kind of an update on how things are going. By Friday afternoon or Friday evening so that I have a sense of what's going on.

240
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:41.100
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Okay. All right. And we're happy to keep you in program is they are not quite ready or it takes a little bit where we want to see you in program. I don't want you to go until I know that you're settled.

241
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:49.530
Helena Rouhe: And like, so let's say you're going to start Marisol or wherever next Tuesday. I'd like you to go to program on Monday.

242
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.320
Helena Rouhe: Okay, because I want to make sure that you are properly transitioned over

243
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.270
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, okay.

244
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:05.190
Helena Rouhe: All right, and it may take longer than that. Sometimes these things take a little bit of sometimes it can go quickly, but it may take a little bit

245
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:06.900
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

246
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:17.970
Helena Rouhe: What about the stuff that's in this room and all of that was there. Did you guys rent a room with furniture or do you have things that you have to move out.

247
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.300
kassidy wheeler: Um, yeah.

248
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.620
kassidy wheeler: So it up to move things out.

249
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:33.960
Helena Rouhe: Okay, how, what do you how do you see that happening. Do you think that's something that you and your sisters mom can do or

250
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.240
kassidy wheeler: The I think my mom to help me. That's it. We have like a

251
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.610
kassidy wheeler: Storage Unit.

252
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.660
kassidy wheeler: That she keeps some things into those

253
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.320
kassidy wheeler: worked out fine.

254
00:28:53.100 --> 00:29:01.800
Helena Rouhe: So you and your sisters and your mom could kind of put it together and do that. How do you have a vehicle to do that with or would you need to rent a U Haul. What would that look like

255
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.290
kassidy wheeler: Um, yeah, my mom's my mom's dad has a truck.

256
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:08.610
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

257
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.940
Helena Rouhe: Good. He helped out or is he

258
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.780
Helena Rouhe: Not necessarily super strong, are able

259
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.820
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, he's not able to

260
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.640
Helena Rouhe: Okay, but you could potentially borrow the truck.

261
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.830
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, okay.

262
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:31.770
Helena Rouhe: So it's going to be really important for you to work on your meal plan, while you're in this transition to because you're going to need your strength. Yeah.

263
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.700
Helena Rouhe: Especially while you're healing from your migraine.

264
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:36.720
Mm hmm.

265
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.190
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

266
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.960
Helena Rouhe: So do you have a sense of your plan, what you need to work on.

267
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.190
Yeah.

268
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:54.480
Helena Rouhe: Now if we go through all of this and one of these programs or both of these programs say they don't have face or it's not going to work. We're going to have to come up with another plan.

269
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.620
kassidy wheeler: Mm hmm.

270
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:05.490
Helena Rouhe: So maybe you need to be talking to your mom about what are, what is another option because it doesn't seem like you staying in this space is going to be an option.

271
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:13.950
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. So at the very least, you need to live somewhere else and hopefully it's been a program where you can have the structure and support you need.

272
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.180
Helena Rouhe: But if

273
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:21.600
Helena Rouhe: That for some reason doesn't work out, maybe talking to your mom about what other options there are potentially

274
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.710
Yeah.

275
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.300
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

276
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.200
Helena Rouhe: You got a lot of homework to do.

277
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.400
kassidy wheeler: Yeah.

278
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.520
Helena Rouhe: Do you want to write this down. Or do you feel like you have a sense of what you need to do, and it's just a matter of making it happen.

279
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.680
kassidy wheeler: I know what I need to do.

280
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:38.610
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

281
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.570
All right, yeah.

282
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:48.990
Helena Rouhe: Do you have any other questions, concerns, anything you want to go over with me. I feel like this is kind of more just let's create a plan and then see how it goes.

283
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:55.380
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, oh yeah, don't really have any thing else

284
00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.990
Helena Rouhe: Do you have food for dinner or what are you doing for food.

285
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.900
kassidy wheeler: Moving forward, I will have

286
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.980
kassidy wheeler: leftovers in the fridge.

287
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.110
Okay.

288
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.380
Helena Rouhe: Okay, are you going to eat them.

289
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.590
Helena Rouhe: Okay. All right.

290
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:33.960
Helena Rouhe: So I look forward to hearing about how things went in group tomorrow night from the group facilitators and then I look forward to hearing from you on Friday afternoon, evening what you've been able to discover as far as the plan goes

291
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.270
kassidy wheeler: Okay.

292
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.910
Helena Rouhe: Any other concerns thoughts.

293
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:54.120
Helena Rouhe: All right, well, it's good to see you. I hope that you're able to take care of yourself and see and make some good progress on this because it would be good to see us right

294
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.430
kassidy wheeler: Yeah, okay.

295
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.570
Helena Rouhe: All right, well, you take care of yourself. I'm gonna let you go.

296
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.670
kassidy wheeler: Great. Thank

297
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.690
Helena Rouhe: You have a good night.

298
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.760
Helena Rouhe: Okay. So just to be clear on the plan.

299
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.630
Helena Rouhe: Cassidy is going to reach out to

300
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.930
Helena Rouhe: Rose with the Capri program. She has a contact there to follow up with

301
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:34.770
Helena Rouhe: If they have availability and what the cost would be she's going to reach out to Marisol that's an IRA S. O. L.

302
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:42.750
Helena Rouhe: In Arizona, there's a program where they have a long term recovery arm about a year long program, I think.

303
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:54.210
Helena Rouhe: For she can stay in the house and kind of be with them and see if they have availability, according to a friend. There's availability, but let's find out at the actual program is available and it's mom can help support that.

304
00:32:55.470 --> 00:33:10.380
Helena Rouhe: She's also needs to talk to a mom about whether what the options are, if either one of these programs go through, or if they don't go through about how she's going to move out of this House to move somewhere else, probably with mama sisters, I think, was an option. Last week, but

305
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:16.080
Helena Rouhe: She needs to move all of her stuff on this House and when she comes up with a plan.

306
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:27.840
Helena Rouhe: Then she needs to talk to, Dad. Dad likely to be upset with the situation and frustrated that she's not just making this work. I don't think at this point it's about her, making it work.

307
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:39.840
Helena Rouhe: I think she is going to need more supportive eating disorder friendly environment for her to thrive right now. I think in the future. She can have more skills to be able to make it work and honest.

308
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:57.300
Helena Rouhe: So she needs to stay in program with bright heart health, until she has a confirmed admittance date for the other program. And if she's not going to admit into another program and she definitely needs to stay with us. So we'll have to wait and see what's going to happen with that.

309
00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:58.920
Helena Rouhe: Thank you.

310
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.350
Helena Rouhe: I'm gonna go ahead and keep the recording going I have another session, starting in 10 minutes with Cassandra for non

311
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.030
Helena Rouhe: Hello.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.290
Helena Rouhe: Whoa, I'm trying to finish up an email. Sorry for the delay.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:22.620
casondra b: That's okay. Yesterday I was like, like up like this. Upset isn't the right word, but I was like, anxious

317
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.990
casondra b: I'm like, all day.

318
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:36.090
casondra b: And I just didn't feel I was like, like, you know, when you you're like oh like annoyed. And then if you get like angry at like littlest thing.

319
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:40.710
casondra b: Yeah, like that's like that's what it was a lot

320
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.850
casondra b: And I was having

321
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.190
Helena Rouhe: There was a lot going on, yesterday I felt. Similarly, maybe there was something going on with the moon or

322
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.640
casondra b: Something

323
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.600
casondra b: Yeah day yesterday. I don't really believe in that shit but

324
00:45:52.020 --> 00:46:00.150
casondra b: Okay. Yeah. And I don't know, like people like oh like Mercury's in Retrograde I'm like versus just being a bitch like what is

325
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.520
casondra b: What is take

326
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.150
casondra b: Responsibility for, like, what the fuck does that even mean like

327
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:15.480
casondra b: The fuck out of here with that but um yeah I was like feeling anxious and like annoyed, and then I think

328
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.190
Helena Rouhe: They both quite concerned about your right in my face right now like I

329
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.830
Helena Rouhe: was worried about. I was going on.

330
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.940
casondra b: She was

331
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:25.650
Helena Rouhe: Like

332
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.630
Helena Rouhe: I need to inspect your face.

333
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.830
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, you'd love

334
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.920
Helena Rouhe: To come on

335
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.490
casondra b: She's gonna do it. Stop. Stop.

336
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.560
Helena Rouhe: You love it.

337
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.260
casondra b: I know, but like, not what I'm trying to do shit.

338
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.650
Helena Rouhe: Direct contact

339
00:46:49.680 --> 00:47:01.620
casondra b: Yeah. Like sometimes she'll like catch me in the middle of a yawn and then she'll put her whole tongue in my mouth. And it's like, like it like feels gross and it's also salty. A lot of it. Oh, it's just disgusting.

340
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:04.440
casondra b: Yeah.

341
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.330
casondra b: So I think, I think like part of why I was like irritated yesterday was

342
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.520
casondra b: Oh, I told you. Okay, so I told you about the backyard situation where I'm trying

343
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.890
casondra b: To finish that project.

344
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:17.430
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

345
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:25.020
casondra b: Yeah, and it was a big project I spent like $300 on everything. And I tried to like keep it. I tried to

346
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:33.270
casondra b: settling down. I tried to keep it like like I wasn't really buying like a lot of stuff. So I was using like a lot of hard labor, just with like

347
00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:41.310
casondra b: The tools that we had, which were like, you know, to break up the ground I use like a claw hammer like I really was not trying to buy a lot of shit.

348
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:54.180
casondra b: Right, and I'm one of my upstairs neighbors was just like, like I'd almost finished the project and then he was like, oh yeah, this is great and like he did help me with the last part of it like lifting up

349
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.710
Helena Rouhe: The rocker

350
00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.000
casondra b: Yeah, and like I'm or no, no, not the guy that like

351
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.350
Helena Rouhe: Move to the wrong with

352
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:02.700
Somebody else

353
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:04.950
casondra b: And

354
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.920
casondra b: This guy's like, weird. He like so I thought he was normal. Up until

355
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.650
casondra b: Right before I got sable

356
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:28.680
casondra b: Like this, this like this guy's like, I have never trusted him says this, so right before I got sable before I adopted her I'd gotten my iOS, a letter I had gotten approval from the manager. Well, I just, you know, told him that I had me as a letter and

357
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:38.160
casondra b: I texted everybody upstairs and I was like, look, I'm getting a dog. If you have any issues I texted them individually. Not a group text.

358
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.090
Helena Rouhe: Individually survey.

359
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.010
casondra b: They didn't you know they they felt

360
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.060
Helena Rouhe: Like their

361
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.380
Helena Rouhe: Peer pressure something

362
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:43.620
casondra b: Right.

363
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.000
Helena Rouhe: Yes, drafted directly

364
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.390
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

365
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:53.700
casondra b: So I said, if anything is weird, please let me know. The next day, my landlord text me. He's like, yo, the guys upstairs.

366
00:48:54.150 --> 00:49:00.900
casondra b: Seem to have a problem. Can you just like reassure them and he didn't I try to get him to say who because I thought it was the guy that moved the rocks.

367
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:10.260
casondra b: Just because he I thought because he has. He's like worked on the backyard. Maybe he was concerned about the dog barking in the backyard again. She wasn't adopted yet.

368
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:12.450
casondra b: Right, not adopted yet.

369
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:13.890
casondra b: Right and so

370
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.480
casondra b: I I texted the guy that his name is Jeff, I texted Jeff because I was like, Yo, I think Justin.

371
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:30.900
casondra b: The Rock guy. I think he like texted attached to the landlord or something. And so then Jeff calls me and he's like oh so no. I think that was me. I'm like, you think

372
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:43.140
casondra b: LIKE YOU LIKE YOU THINK YOU EITHER. DID or you didn't, bro. Like what the fuck, and then it was like this weird conversation where he like made like I could just, you know, when you can tell somebody's lying.

373
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.940
casondra b: Like like

374
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:57.240
casondra b: It was over the phone like he like he started to say like, Oh, well, I'm Justin was saying that you have a dog and because it's an s because I said in the text. I was like, I'm getting an emotional support animal like I'm not saying I got

375
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.470
Helena Rouhe: laid it out. Yeah.

376
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:13.110
casondra b: I was like, I didn't, you know, and so he's like yeah, Justin was all excited and he said that because it's an ESA the dog just will be like up in our apartment without you. There was essentially what he said. And I was like, no, like, first of all, I don't even go up there. I will

377
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:17.610
casondra b: Put my dog up there. That's also a really weird thing.

378
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.270
Helena Rouhe: Right, like

379
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:28.410
casondra b: Best would never say that. Like he and I don't know each other like that. Um, and the guy was trying to frame it like, oh yeah. His, His housemate because again, two separate

380
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:34.560
casondra b: We have no connection up there, really, like, there's our, our space down here is ours. There's Facebook there's there's

381
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:42.510
casondra b: Um, he was trying to make the argument that Justin told him it would be like a house dog and I'm like I don't live in your house, bro. Like,

382
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:50.520
casondra b: Friends boat, and then he and then he proceeded to, like, change the subject, and like throw Justin under the bus trying to say like he

383
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:58.470
casondra b: Was like butchering this tree in the backyard, which I AGREE, THE TREE WAS butchered, but like, what the fuck does that have to do with the conversation we're having

384
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:09.510
casondra b: And then like he was trying to say like basically trying to like paint Justin like he was crazy. And I was just like, Okay, so the issue you're fine. Are we good like can I can I

385
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:20.040
casondra b: Hang up now. And so he was, like, ever since then, when I was like okay and like all of my old coworker brought up a great point. When I told her about this. She, she was like, okay, look.

386
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.850
casondra b: Those guys that live upstairs sound like fucking

387
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:34.230
casondra b: Bitch baby white man boys like the proof the white privilege. The white male privilege radiating from that area is so intense, because this, this man had to

388
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:45.960
casondra b: Take a situation where you were. You are getting a emotional support animal for your mental health and he had it has nothing to do with him and he had to make it about him.

389
00:51:47.190 --> 00:52:00.840
casondra b: And I was like, that's a great point that has nothing to do with him and it never did and he had to make it about him by the next day I said, you know, because I was very direct, like if you're a problem, bring it to me. So we can address it before it becomes a

390
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.050
Helena Rouhe: Right.

391
00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:08.130
casondra b: You know, and then he goes out of his way to contact the landlord, which is like a really intense thing to do.

392
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:16.950
casondra b: And yeah, ever since then I've like not really trusted him, and then he likes. So he's the guy that like helped me and I was very skeptical.

393
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:32.670
casondra b: Right. I know. And he was I was very skeptical. And then he started talking about back to the original like stressor, he started talking about like doing the, the rest of the background, which is a very big area, like I do, a third of it.

394
00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.600
Helena Rouhe: I'm

395
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.670
casondra b: To give you an idea and

396
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:58.950
casondra b: He likes. So now he is like yes spent some time out there, moving rocks around because again it's like deep rocks and he like we don't necessarily. I was like okay well I mean I guess I can help you if you want but like we didn't agree on like division of labor or like how long it went

397
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:03.960
casondra b: Or like it. I'm not spending any more money, frankly, like I told him I was like, look.

398
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.260
casondra b: I spent like I didn't tell him how much I spent but I

399
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.590
casondra b: Thought it was very obvious that I had spent all of the money on this section.

400
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:11.430
Helena Rouhe: Right, right.

401
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.240
casondra b: What me with like

402
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:30.660
casondra b: Maybe an hour to of work with my section and I appreciate that. Right. And like, and I will help you know, but I'm not spending any more money and I, and we don't agree on, like how to do it. Also, so like I have seed a bag of seed that I bought which will do the entire backyard. If

403
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:42.210
casondra b: They want to buy soil, then I will help them and we can lay the seed and it will grow into grass and it'll be fine. And then like the next day he was like, Okay, well, Justin are going to buy more solid. And I was like,

404
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.770
casondra b: Okay, because then there's also the question of who's going to maintain it.

405
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.060
casondra b: Right, like who's going to maintain this like ginormous.

406
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:58.650
casondra b: I don't know. And so it was really stressing me out because I feel very like pressured, and he does this really weird thing which

407
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.710
casondra b: So I heard him talking on the phone, I'll get to, and this is why I think he's doing it deliberately I'll get to that point in a second.

408
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.440
casondra b: But he has this thing where he like

409
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:19.290
casondra b: And I'm not sure if he's doing this because, like, I'm a, I'm a woman, and he just doesn't care or he doesn't like register. What I'm saying because he sees me as lesser than or if he's really just

410
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:35.970
casondra b: Like I'm trying to manipulate the situation that much regardless of who I am. Like, I don't know if he does this with everybody. But he, he, like, he'll ask a question or he'll say, like, let's do this thing. And I will say, Well, I think the more practical option is this

411
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.660
casondra b: And then he'll be like, Okay. And then the next day hos the same question.

412
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:48.150
casondra b: Like trying to, like, I can tell you try and get me to, like, change my answer or like say something else like he's trying to get me to agree to things that I'm just like, no.

413
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:49.800
casondra b: I don't want to do it that way.

414
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.330
casondra b: And I'm not going to do it that way.

415
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.260
casondra b: And like

416
00:54:52.560 --> 00:55:04.110
casondra b: Or he'll like say I'll ask a question. I'll answer it about like what I'm doing. The next day, he'll ask the same question. I'll be like, yes, I just said I was going to do it this way. Like, I'm not gonna say something different this time.

417
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:10.440
casondra b: And the reason why I think he's doing it intentionally because I heard him on the phone like he was like obviously within earshot right like

418
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.870
casondra b: Very clearly within earshot. When I was out there working. He's on the phone with somebody

419
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.660
casondra b: And like, I've heard him on the phone like multiple times. Like he is trying to get all of his friends and family to invest in stocks.

420
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:32.430
casondra b: It's really weird. I don't think I don't think that that's his job. I just think he's trying to convince people to spend their money on stocks but then he was talking to this other guy and I thought he was talking to him about stocks and he was talking to him about

421
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:45.840
casondra b: I guess his friend got a new girlfriend or something. And the way that he was talking about that situation with this dude about how like the way you need to talk to women, so that they respond better and

422
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.940
casondra b: Not he didn't use the words like get them to do what you want to do, but that was what he was talking about.

423
00:55:51.780 --> 00:56:00.300
casondra b: He's like, You gotta. He's like, you got to say, you know, think about like how you frame it. Do you want her to think this or do you want them to think this and it's just like

424
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.800
Helena Rouhe: Trying to manipulate

425
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:09.240
casondra b: Okay, yeah, that's very manipulative. I don't know if you're seeing it that way. But it's like he read the secret and he is trying to manifest

426
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:16.290
casondra b: Manifest manifest like it is just weird. It is weird. Very strange. Um,

427
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.270
casondra b: Yeah, I don't know. So like I just don't trust him.

428
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:28.020
casondra b: I don't, I'm not thrilled about doing like I feel so good that this is done and I

429
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.130
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, huge

430
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:29.550
casondra b: Yeah.

431
00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.150
Helena Rouhe: Big deal.

432
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.360
casondra b: I just want to be finished. I'm not trying to spend any more money.

433
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.670
casondra b: So like all of these three things.

434
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.360
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

435
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:41.340
casondra b: And also I don't love like working next to him. Like, I don't. I don't.

436
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.540
casondra b: Really want to listen to his country music or talk to him about anything like

437
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:52.470
casondra b: Right, I'm a very different not like I'm better than him. But we just do not have any divergent interest at all.

438
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.240
casondra b: Automation I don't trust him.

439
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.000
casondra b: Like, yeah, it's weird. It's really weird.

440
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:12.330
casondra b: And I, I don't know. So that was like stressing me out and giver my housemate keeps saying like, you're not obligated to do shit like

441
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:21.390
casondra b: You don't have to do anything. And I'm like, you're right. But I also don't want to make a problem where there's not one like I don't know if I'm

442
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.940
casondra b: If I'm just being overly sensitive, because I don't trust him and like that's guiding

443
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.350
casondra b: This like cascade of of thoughts and feelings.

444
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.830
casondra b: And I also just feel like he took my project that I was doing my dog and hi john

445
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.880
casondra b: Did made it something that made made it again, a situation that benefits him.

446
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:55.080
casondra b: That involves him and I just did not want to involve him like the other things. So when he helped me. I never asked him to he went out there. He's like, Oh, yeah. Text me de de de like I

447
00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.090
casondra b: Didn't

448
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:58.980
casondra b: He was just out there.

449
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:08.160
casondra b: And it just, you know, one day we were both out there at the same time, and he did help me and I was very grateful. Um, but it's strange. Like, it feels

450
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.300
casondra b: Yeah, I don't know.

451
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:19.290
casondra b: Because the amount of helping he helped me with um does not equal the amount of health that I will now have to do to finish the rest of the backyard.

452
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:20.670
Helena Rouhe: You don't need

453
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.420
Helena Rouhe: You don't need to finish with the backyard your project is done.

454
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.450
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, whatever they decide to do is on them.

455
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:28.230
casondra b: Yeah.

456
00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:32.010
casondra b: Or him. Yeah. Well, he also got Justin there, the guy that

457
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.060
casondra b: Other guy she got him to agree to help

458
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:50.520
Helena Rouhe: Well, they can do all of that and you can just say, You know what guys i what i can contribute to this this seed for soil. But if you're going a different way than I am going to what I'm going to contribute is maintaining what I've done, so that it stays nice

459
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:56.850
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. And if I happen to be out here and I can do a little bit. I will but

460
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.570
Yeah.

461
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:10.650
casondra b: Yeah, never agreed, like when he was talking about, it will be nice to have the entire backer I did it. I was never like yes, let's do that. I was like, yeah, that would be nice. Sure, if you want.

462
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:17.940
Helena Rouhe: To your point, who's gonna mowed the lawn. Now, I mean a little section is one thing, but how are you going to keep the grass cut good can get on really

463
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:22.860
casondra b: Well, so I bought that was another thing that I bought sorry this lighting is like terrible

464
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.590
casondra b: Um, so I bought

465
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.180
casondra b: A push mower like one of those. And I know

466
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.900
Helena Rouhe: Oh, cool.

467
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:31.830
casondra b: It was so

468
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:37.980
casondra b: It was really cheap. And so I was like, and and at the time that I purchased it, I was like, I'm only going to have to do

469
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.840
Helena Rouhe: A little section.

470
00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:40.680
Yeah.

471
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.040
casondra b: And we just like

472
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:51.810
Helena Rouhe: Mars for your little section if they want to get a bigger mower for their whole area. Fine. But that's not the point.

473
00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:59.640
casondra b: Yeah. And then also, like the one thing that the big thing that we don't agree on, because we have all these little rocks and like

474
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:13.470
casondra b: Nowhere to put them because we have a section in the middle where there's like a picnic table and like a little tiny fire pit. And I was like, we need to preserve this section and have rocks here because we just have nowhere else to put these and I hesitate to like

475
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.880
casondra b: I don't know, put them on Craigslist for free. Like, even if that would work. Like, what if lamb or gets mad because that's another thing we haven't told them. We're doing this.

476
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.080
casondra b: I feel like

477
01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:32.790
casondra b: One. Yeah, I don't know what's better or worse at this point it's already my sections already done so, I don't feel like, and I don't know the context in which he would be like, Yeah, don't do that.

478
01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:40.260
casondra b: But like, I don't know, I feel like getting rid of things that are back there is none.

479
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.120
Helena Rouhe: What you would want to know.

480
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:52.440
casondra b: So very, like, I don't know. We need to like make that section bigger so that the grass area is smaller, like I just have all these thoughts and they're just like so gung ho about it.

481
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.930
casondra b: I don't know. I just don't want to.

482
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.730
casondra b: I thought I was finished, you know,

483
01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:01.740
Helena Rouhe: You're done with your part.

484
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.840
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, whatever they do is on them.

485
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.340
casondra b: And like even if they even if they wanted to, like I did more than a third

486
01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:21.030
casondra b: By right like almost entirely by myself, which is like another thing that I've been thinking like I did, I did do more than a third, even if the three of us and we wanted to do that like I did more than a third of this backyard.

487
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:22.140
Helena Rouhe: merry go

488
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.760
Helena Rouhe: So, you're done.

489
01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:27.030
casondra b: Yeah, I just like, I don't know if it's

490
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:38.550
casondra b: All know like I feel like I have to like justify these things in my head. Even though, like if I was if this was somebody else and I was like hearing this, I'd be like, what the fuck like no don't like

491
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:44.130
casondra b: I just don't want to be like. Again, I don't want to make a problem where there's not one and I don't want to like

492
01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.430
casondra b: I don't know. I don't want to come off as crazy because I feel like they already think I'm crazy, you know, I mean,

493
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.800
Helena Rouhe: So how does you saying I've done my part come off. It's crazy.

494
01:01:55.950 --> 01:02:10.380
casondra b: Because there because he's hearing in his mind that I've agreed to do this and the like, oh, like just that that I've agreed to do this and if I say, No, I'm not going to now he was gonna be like well why did you say that you were. And it was like, I didn't

495
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.100
Helena Rouhe: I never did.

496
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.660
Helena Rouhe: So that was not that was not my big agreement.

497
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.880
Helena Rouhe: And if he says, but remember when I said you can say

498
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:31.260
Helena Rouhe: I agree that it would be cool. But at the same time we're doing a lot of different things. Maybe now we have to get the landlord involved like there's all these things. You can't do it just because you have this music

499
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.520
Yeah.

500
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.870
casondra b: Yeah.

501
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.260
casondra b: I don't know, it feels better to just talk about it.

502
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.920
casondra b: Like to saying it all out loud. I'm like, yeah, that's

503
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.160
Yeah.

504
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:56.790
Helena Rouhe: Well, I'm stupid. It says it's understandable that you're trying to do your part and stay under the radar and not create problems, but also being mindful, you know, the whole dynamic

505
01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:05.940
casondra b: Yeah. Yes. True factual. But also, like, I think the part that like upsets me the most is what I said like this was a project that I had for my dog.

506
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.330
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

507
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.320
Helena Rouhe: Well, to me, and now

508
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.760
casondra b: Now, it's like, this big.

509
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.220
casondra b: overwhelming task.

510
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:21.120
Helena Rouhe: So keep focused on your project. And if you have to. You can get this cute little like white chain fence that just creates for your little city.

511
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.380
Helena Rouhe: You know, I mean, if you need to you can sectioned off and be like, this is

512
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.920
Helena Rouhe: For my emotional support animal maybe put up a little sign

513
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:33.480
casondra b: Well, they all know because when he came and he saw me doing it. I told him exactly why I was like yeah

514
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.910
Helena Rouhe: I mean, if you feel like you need to create your

515
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.500
Helena Rouhe: Space to maintain your face.

516
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:37.830
casondra b: Yeah.

517
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:38.610
Helena Rouhe: But you have to do.

518
01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.200
casondra b: Yeah yeah

519
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.510
casondra b: The other. Yeah, kind of unrelated, but also related to dog. She has been having this

520
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:54.600
casondra b: And tell me, this has ever happened with any of your big dogs, but she's having urinary incontinence.

521
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:55.620
Helena Rouhe: Huh.

522
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:59.010
casondra b: Which is like freaking me out. I'm gonna take her to the vet tomorrow.

523
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.230
casondra b: But, um,

524
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:15.930
casondra b: I first I didn't know what was happening, like, maybe it started maybe a couple weeks ago and I didn't really notice what was happening, like the spots were small enough where I was like, did she just looking herself and like novelty rule.

525
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.450
casondra b: And I would smell it, it wouldn't smell like anything.

526
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:27.780
casondra b: You know, and then I'd wash it and I move on, and it was all it was always on my bed which thankfully I have a lot of blankets on there so it didn't like get all the way down to the mattress, but

527
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:34.710
casondra b: Like the last couple days it's happened like like this week it's happened three times and it happens the same

528
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:35.970
Helena Rouhe: I have a bladder infection.

529
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:48.720
casondra b: That's what I'm thinking. And so, it happened this morning when I was like asleep and I heard her looking. And I was like, Oh, no. And I, you know, yeah, put her in the crate, because I was like now fuck up. It's like six in the morning I

530
01:04:48.810 --> 01:05:03.870
casondra b: You know, I'm not going to get up right now. I just strip the bed, got a different blanket went back to bed. Um, and then last night when I was cooking. Oh my god. So that was, that was the worst where there was two spots that were like puddles.

531
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.590
casondra b: Of just urine and that's what I realized I was like

532
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:15.450
casondra b: That was when I was like, Okay, what's happening and I was like my dog is like licking herself and there's like what's happening. And there was like

533
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:31.680
casondra b: A lot of stuff on like, oh, it could be, you know, hormonal. It happens a lot with big female dogs that are fixed, but it also said it's more common, like the hormonal stuff is more common with overweight and older dogs, which she is not

534
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:52.800
casondra b: And like the thing that scared me. Of course, like the Internet, always. It was like, if it's hormonal that's a life that's a lifetime thing there is like the chance of infection because it's there's urine obviously everywhere. And so that just like scare the shit out of me.

535
01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:57.090
Helena Rouhe: She probably just has a little bladder infection and she's been gradually getting more

536
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:02.280
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and I see blinking. Then she's trying to kind of keep yourself clean and then to

537
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:15.270
Helena Rouhe: Ghana losing her bladder. And so you're gonna have to take her out a little bit more often right now and to get her probably get antibiotics and it'll probably resolved, you know, fairly quickly. Yeah.

538
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.680
casondra b: The fact that it's like

539
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.950
Helena Rouhe: It's been getting progressively worse.

540
01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.770
Helena Rouhe: Suggested that something more like that. Yeah.

541
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.660
Helena Rouhe: Case scenario, you might need to have some adult dog diaper.

542
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:39.630
Helena Rouhe: I was thinking for like a day or two, you know i mean it's it's kind of a but they kind of, you know, at least, it kind of contained things, they'll keep her from licking and all that kind of stuff for me.

543
01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:49.500
casondra b: What I've what I've noticed is that it only happens when she licks, and it only happens when she was like resting and then she'll start licking and that's when it happens, it's not like

544
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:54.570
casondra b: But then like sometimes after when she's looking and I catch her. And I'm like, No, no, stop, and she like

545
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.640
casondra b: Gets up. I can see it like dripping.

546
01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:57.120
Helena Rouhe: Yes.

547
01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.740
casondra b: Yes, no idea what's happening.

548
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.510
Helena Rouhe: Right. So it could be that she's looking cuz something's bothering her and then

549
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.840
casondra b: That

550
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.190
Helena Rouhe: The irritation. Yeah, so

551
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:06.780
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

552
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:15.900
Helena Rouhe: So, so in our amateur hour of that clinic. We've now discovered she has a bladder infection and now you'll just go get the final expert.

553
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:17.160
Yeah.

554
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.420
casondra b: Yeah, I like that better than the lifelong hormone

555
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:25.770
Helena Rouhe: Doesn't need to be a lifelong hormonal thing because you would have already seen it by now.

556
01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:32.100
casondra b: Yeah, good. That's a good point. I like that too. Um, but yeah. So I'm going to take her tomorrow.

557
01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:37.320
casondra b: And like she what she's not in any pain, which is like the other weird thing like

558
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:41.490
Helena Rouhe: You think that yeah I mean she was necessarily be crying. She's fairly so

559
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.340
Helena Rouhe: It's dogs who just, you know, irritation,

560
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:51.780
casondra b: Yeah, that's a good point because there was a tough. Yeah, that's a good point, too, because there was a time when she had like really bad diarrhea.

561
01:07:52.200 --> 01:08:04.260
casondra b: Not the time they took her to the hospital, but the time before that she like mess in her crate. It was horrible, but she was like, totally fine. And I would expect that would those symptoms. She'd be like noticeable pain, but she wasn't at all.

562
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.120
Helena Rouhe: If your dog. So, you know, you guys mirror each other a little bit

563
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:10.530
Yeah.

564
01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:22.590
casondra b: Yeah, I just, like, yeah, I hope that they can just, like, give me a definitive answer but I it's like a vet. They have to write like they can't just be like,

565
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:28.290
Helena Rouhe: More thing probably do a little culture and all that. Hopefully it won't take long. But likely that's what's going on.

566
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:29.220
Yeah.

567
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.030
casondra b: Yeah okay now I feel better about that too.

568
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.310
casondra b: Yeah, I mean, those were. Those are like the big things.

569
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:44.430
Helena Rouhe: How are you doing with food and all of that stuff.

570
01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.880
casondra b: On second Oh God, not as great.

571
01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:54.990
casondra b: Guy will be transparent. I like purged twice this week for the first time in years.

572
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:55.890
casondra b: And

573
01:08:56.010 --> 01:09:00.840
casondra b: I'll awful like I didn't feel good. Afterwards, I felt really bad both times.

574
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:07.260
Helena Rouhe: Any particular trigger it. The thing to call this stuff going on or

575
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.720
casondra b: I think it's a combination of like having the thoughts doing

576
01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.980
casondra b: For so many months after not really consciously having them for

577
01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:24.870
casondra b: What I considered several years like that would have little flare ups but like honestly I was involved in my, in my drug addiction to worry about that.

578
01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:29.250
casondra b: And I feel like I had this like five, six year break

579
01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:34.710
casondra b: And then all of a sudden it's like this CON. It's like again this constant

580
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:41.940
casondra b: Knowing feeling and then like obviously I had the impression that I had eaten too much but like

581
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:45.450
casondra b: Realistically, not. It wasn't like a binge.

582
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:48.870
Helena Rouhe: The next piece.

583
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.610
casondra b: Yeah.

584
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.570
Helena Rouhe: Today,

585
01:09:51.840 --> 01:10:00.000
casondra b: Very well happen. Well, I don't even know if it was like to see what what happened. It was just like I felt like, oh, I want to eat later so I better do this.

586
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:00.840
Helena Rouhe: Hmm.

587
01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.180
casondra b: And it like it was just like such a

588
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:08.910
casondra b: I don't know. It felt very degrading and like, I'm like, I was like embarrassed, you know,

589
01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:10.710
casondra b: And that's like we kind of

590
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:15.450
Helena Rouhe: Need to do that to let that go. Do you think now the thoughts are not going to be as pervasive.

591
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:26.880
casondra b: Alrighty. That's a nice thought. But I don't think so. I mean like I am trying now. See that's the thing. It's like I know what a slippery slope that is

592
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.140
casondra b: And also it's like not

593
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:39.420
casondra b: It's not cute. It's not like even if you are stick. Then if you are doing that. That's disgusting. That's disgusting. Like, you should just be fat right

594
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:48.480
casondra b: Like, you should just like you should just fucking work out or do something else, because that is not where it's at. It's

595
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:56.940
Helena Rouhe: Not, I mean, it's really not good for your body. I mean, there's all this physical demand, it's, you know, overall, it's going to take a huge toll on your

596
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.040
Helena Rouhe: Physical symptoms that takes a

597
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.020
Helena Rouhe: Huge toll on your mental system.

598
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:03.960
casondra b: That's like the biggest thing, it becomes so

599
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.470
casondra b: So obsessive like I like it just cascades into this out of control.

600
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.640
casondra b: Thing and like

601
01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.740
casondra b: I know that I'm aware of that.

602
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:19.230
casondra b: Right, and so I'm trying to, like, and I'm being upfront about it now. Are you like I

603
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:31.860
casondra b: Was very much considering like even when you just asked me right. I was like, do I be honest and like I think that making the decision to share that makes me

604
01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.500
casondra b: more accountable to myself.

605
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.150
Helena Rouhe: Do you think stable both a little bit more concerned about you because that's

606
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:46.260
Helena Rouhe: Definitely a different shift in behavior than I've seen before, when you've been in session. Yeah.

607
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:49.980
casondra b: I mean, yeah, she she wasn't she didn't really know what was going on.

608
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:54.240
casondra b: Like I put her in her crate and then I just went to the bathroom like she

609
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.430
casondra b: I don't think that she could, like, figure out what I was doing, or like

610
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.410
casondra b: Yeah, and I didn't like act differently, like she seemed

611
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:08.850
casondra b: You know yeah that i know i mean she seemed fine but like also

612
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:18.960
casondra b: Yeah, I just don't want to. I don't want to be that person anymore. And like I just frankly can't be that person because I have like I have to take care of her.

613
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.060
Helena Rouhe: Are you going to ship this

614
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:27.150
casondra b: I think saying I think talking about it is like the first hand up.

615
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:27.540
Helena Rouhe: And

616
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.880
casondra b: I like you know making myself accountable in a therapy setting.

617
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:41.460
casondra b: Is a good first step and then just like being more conscious about it. Like I feel like

618
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:56.040
casondra b: I don't know, I just need to like really be aware that that like that. Could that could be a potential. So just, like, be careful with what you do like not restrict or whatever. But just like

619
01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:58.140
casondra b: The mind.

620
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:59.340
Helena Rouhe: Give me some

621
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:03.450
Helena Rouhe: Suggestions of ways to kind of help you avoid that.

622
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:11.070
casondra b: I mean, it's none that are like really good

623
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:17.340
casondra b: Like obviously I could be like, oh, I could drink less beer because I was like, another thing is that doing so much yard work.

624
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:32.280
casondra b: I would enjoy a beer or three and then when I would drink the beer. I was like okay well that's like 500 calories that you just inhaled. So like you can't eat as much today. And so I could tell you, like, I could just drink glass, but that we would be for the wrong reasons.

625
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:40.560
casondra b: Like end result is good because I'm drinking last which I would also like to do but but then like for you for. You see what I'm saying by for the wrong.

626
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.850
Helena Rouhe: Reason. Yeah, yeah.

627
01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:43.200
casondra b: So like

628
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.800
casondra b: That is something that I could do

629
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.640
Helena Rouhe: That would prob. What about this idea about being mindful, I

630
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.300
Helena Rouhe: Mean I think

631
01:13:51.330 --> 01:14:08.160
Helena Rouhe: connecting to your choices and really paying attention to what you are consuming and when and for what reasons is probably the bigger piece, you have a lot of education, you have a lot of understanding you know what you need to do and

632
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:12.840
Helena Rouhe: So I think you can be your best counsel if you allow yourself to be present.

633
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:25.470
Helena Rouhe: To know what's happening and think about it and then even just the drinking piece. If you want to be a little more cognizant of how much you're drinking and why that's going to help all that

634
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:35.130
casondra b: Yeah, I think, like the why part is good because they're the days that it happened. There was a lot of like bored eating just hard right now because everybody's important in

635
01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:38.910
casondra b: Your home all day, and like I don't keep sweet stuff in the house because like

636
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:47.100
casondra b: It just is easier to not, but I can't, like, I can't keep like food out of the house. You know what I mean. So

637
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.090
Helena Rouhe: Now you need it.

638
01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.830
casondra b: Yeah, and so

639
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.690
casondra b: Like I try not to get junk food. I try to just have like, and also I tried to have stuff that I have to make into meals.

640
01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.860
casondra b: That seems to help because with bored eating. What is what I mean.

641
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.450
casondra b: Because you're not

642
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:16.980
casondra b: Yeah, it's not it's not just like eating crackers or like occasionally like I'll, I'll get something that I can indulge in but like not often because when I do have that I tend to like, yeah, do a lot of bored eating.

643
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:29.190
Helena Rouhe: So, what's something you can do to help you if you start to get a sense that you are either getting ready to board eat or you are in fact bored eating. What can you do in those moments to kind of shift gears a little bit.

644
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:32.250
casondra b: I mean, I can. Yeah, I can take sable for a walk.

645
01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:44.190
casondra b: Or smoke cigarettes. When I feel that coming on to which is not like a great thing. But it definitely stops that craving to eat because I can't smoking. I do not understand people that smoke cigarettes and eat.

646
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:45.300
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

647
01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.680
casondra b: It is well after

648
01:15:47.910 --> 01:16:00.120
Helena Rouhe: So, I mean, again, this is all these behaviors that you're doing that, you're not excited about. But you're recognizing our existing maybe let's look at it from instead of picking just one this work on overall

649
01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:12.000
Helena Rouhe: Mean, you've been really working on overall. And I think that my senses. If you become myopic and one that's going to be an opportunity for rebellion or rationalization or whatever, where the bigger picture is

650
01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:26.070
Helena Rouhe: You want to be well so that you can take care of Fable and stay on the big picture plan of saving money. Eventually, having a house, having more dogs and this is your big picture plan in order for you to do that and be the most successful, you need to be

651
01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.000
Helena Rouhe: healthy human being who can follow through on these plans.

652
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:31.110
Yeah.

653
01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:42.300
Helena Rouhe: So maybe stay focused on the big picture, maybe work on visuals, or things little notes or something to kind of stay focused on the big picture so that as you're becoming

654
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:55.050
Helena Rouhe: Aware and potentially reactive, or maybe annoyed will screw screw this I'm, I'm hungry, I'm going to eat or I'm bored. I'm going to have this or I'm going to whatever you can just kind of go, Yeah, I could do that or

655
01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:06.240
Helena Rouhe: What could I do that would be more along the lines of big picture. Not that I can't you know I'm the bad person. If I do these things, or, you know, it's not the shame game. It's just, that's an option.

656
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:18.930
Helena Rouhe: Or I can go do that. So I think that kind of process will be more in line with you, helping you. Take care of yourself better than it being a power struggle about what's good and not good.

657
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.100
casondra b: Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I just don't want to like

658
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:35.070
casondra b: What I mean by, like, you know, good versus not good but like I just don't want to slip into something else destructive because I'm trying to like

659
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:35.880
Helena Rouhe: I think it's

660
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:43.320
Helena Rouhe: Very good awareness and you're already acknowledging drinking, smoking, you know, it could potentially be any number of things. You're right.

661
01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:55.260
Helena Rouhe: Louis. So instead of focusing on one thing. Look at the mindfulness look at kind of being connected you're way more connected and aware now than you were six months ago, eight months ago, you know,

662
01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.160
Helena Rouhe: You have a much better sense of things and you have a lot of knowledge and

663
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:11.190
Helena Rouhe: you've now created this neat little outdoor space. Maybe you're going to make it for you and stable. Maybe you want a nice little chair out there are a little umbrella. You know, there's different things that you can do that.

664
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:17.970
Helena Rouhe: Or you go for a walk or maybe there's things that you're going to do in your own space and then there's all sorts of things that you can

665
01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:32.280
Helena Rouhe: Find to do to manage these different things that are going to come up for you, which is normal, because now you're in a space where this stuff can come up before it was a little bit more crisis triage. Let's just survive the moment

666
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:38.010
casondra b: Yeah i mean i i would argue that I've always been like painfully self aware when it comes to

667
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.290
Helena Rouhe: I agree, but I think it was more in a torturous way than productive. Let's do something

668
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:44.850
Helena Rouhe: Yes, a picture. Yeah.

669
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:48.510
casondra b: It's hot. Yes. And it's hard to shift gears and so just hit it.

670
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.280
Helena Rouhe: Think about it. Come to me.

671
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:53.310
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, it becomes its own addiction to be

672
01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.750
Helena Rouhe: It's an it's an why I like to call it emotional cutting

673
01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:58.890
Yeah.

674
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:04.710
Helena Rouhe: When we can analyze and theater. So based on behavior.

675
01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:21.930
casondra b: Yeah, yeah, definitely the agent. A lot of that. I don't know. But I have noticed that like it's easier for me to do like hobby things because like I've always thought like or not like good at anything. And also, like, I don't enjoy a lot of things.

676
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:31.980
casondra b: Which is, I assume that is like the depression that just makes everything very doll and tedious and everything seems like a chore.

677
01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:45.120
casondra b: But since I've given up dope. I'm awake, Rajan and I know like a lot more often. I used to sleep a lot. And so I have to like fill up the time

678
01:19:45.840 --> 01:20:00.930
casondra b: And like I got really into embroidery like a while ago. Right. And then I stopped completely and I use sable as an excuse for why I stopped like a first. That was a very good excuse but then after a while I was like, no, I still don't like that's not a good excuse me more.

679
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.980
casondra b: So I tried to pick that up again even though I'm stoked on the projects that I'm working on. I guess I could start another one. But it's like I'd have to

680
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.320
casondra b: There's like parts of it that I don't like right like looking gritting the fabric so that you don't

681
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.180
Helena Rouhe: Add pretty detailed

682
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:27.750
casondra b: Oh, it's takes so many hours to just grid this thing and if you miss count. Like, I tried to start grading, so I could do a project that I wanted to more. Let me show you why don't

683
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.510
casondra b: We show you I don't like this one.

684
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.210
casondra b: So it's a very, it's a very beautiful painting called hi listen and then by

685
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.590
casondra b: Oh god, I don't know, some I used to have a name is

686
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:42.510
Helena Rouhe: Maria. Yeah.

687
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:49.500
casondra b: So I got so far. But look at how Falcon orange this man turn

688
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.510
casondra b: This is his waist. He's wearing he's wearing a blue shirt with like a

689
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.990
casondra b: Look at how fucking orgy is

690
01:20:58.710 --> 01:20:59.670
Helena Rouhe: Just wearing bronzer.

691
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:00.960
Bro.

692
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:10.830
casondra b: Know, once I saw that and that's like the cold four colors. This is like supposed to be a pattern from a reputable company.

693
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:25.530
casondra b: Um, and I just when I started, I was like, oh, that seems awful orange. I wonder what this is going to be. And then I was like, oh, it's the fucking guy and then I was like, did more and more of it. And I didn't hold back. I was like, I fucking hate it.

694
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.200
casondra b: I hate it so much.

695
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:36.960
casondra b: And I don't know, I just been kind of like doing it just to like zone out and do it don't like fuck I hate the way that looks

696
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.720
casondra b: Nice white orange.

697
01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:41.340
Helena Rouhe: Well,

698
01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:45.180
Helena Rouhe: This is what you're starting to appreciate, now is your

699
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.240
Helena Rouhe: Static in a different way. You know, you've used a lot of

700
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.110
casondra b: Your painting.

701
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.410
casondra b: Well then orange and the painting.

702
01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:53.100
Like

703
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:59.130
casondra b: Even if I were to take that image and put it into like one of those automatic like make your own pattern machine.

704
01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.690
casondra b: Yeah, yeah, Orange.

705
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:05.190
Helena Rouhe: Well, maybe this is an opportunity for you to adjust what's already there.

706
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:09.030
casondra b: Oh, I have to that would destroy it. If I took that much stitching.

707
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.260
casondra b: Hmm. Like I would really thought that would be like a whole

708
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.960
casondra b: That would be worth reading the fabric. All right.

709
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:17.010
Helena Rouhe: Well then let's not be

710
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:18.930
casondra b: There but then moving forward.

711
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:21.270
Helena Rouhe: Now you know that for the next

712
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.410
casondra b: Project, you have

713
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.450
Helena Rouhe: To be a little bit more attentive to color.

714
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:25.830
Helena Rouhe: Because you're seeing things and

715
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:28.200
Helena Rouhe: Experiencing them on a different level. Now,

716
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:39.720
casondra b: Yeah, and it just makes me wonder, because the girls in the water, or like lily white and so I'm like, or is it just like a bunch of lily white girls next to this orange dude like

717
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:53.580
casondra b: Whoo. Whoo. Okay, this like there had to be there had to be a fucking like meeting about this. They had to be like this one. And everyone was like, No, no, you know, like, I don't. I just don't understand

718
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:56.820
casondra b: I'm

719
01:22:58.230 --> 01:22:59.880
casondra b: The bathroom. Hold on. Sorry.

720
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.630
casondra b: Sorry, I've had like five coke zeros to

721
01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:28.740
Helena Rouhe: Boy.

722
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.920
casondra b: I know I like when I was a kid, I used to

723
01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:40.260
casondra b: I feel like my weird tasting food. I like, I like to blame it on my mom. She was like, really fat like 400 pounds.

724
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:42.930
casondra b: And so she would always like

725
01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:50.430
casondra b: Have like she and she didn't cook ever so like McDonald's and she would always get like Diet Cokes she would get like

726
01:24:51.540 --> 01:25:00.780
casondra b: Three whole as meals for herself and then a large Diet Coke and then so I of course became a soda addict and like I would just drink.

727
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.610
casondra b: So much soda as a kid. And if I buy it for myself I drink a lot of it.

728
01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:11.430
Helena Rouhe: Which is like, I don't know, I'll be curious to see what shift.

729
01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:15.300
Helena Rouhe: Over time as you develop this mindmeld mindfulness

730
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:32.730
Helena Rouhe: All about your behaviors and consumption self care. It's not something that I want to see dramatic change in right away. I think better for you to have a slow awareness flash making little adjustments here and there and seeing how you think and feel about it.

731
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.770
casondra b: Yeah, I mean, honestly, I might die. Go. I might go to my grave like drinking lots of direct

732
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.270
casondra b: You know to do

733
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:41.340
casondra b: I just hate water so much

734
01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.880
Helena Rouhe: There's other things besides water like tea.

735
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:50.250
casondra b: I don't like to either like I can drink coffee, but I can only have so much coffee before it stops.

736
01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:52.050
casondra b: Working

737
01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:58.080
casondra b: I don't know. I like fuzzy stuff, but like, get the fuck out of here with that fucking

738
01:25:59.220 --> 01:25:59.970
casondra b: mcroy

739
01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.590
Helena Rouhe: Oh, yeah.

740
01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.030
casondra b: No man.

741
01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:13.500
Helena Rouhe: Well, it definitely is not the same kind of situation is, you almost have to kind of detox yourself from soda before you were to have something like LaCroix or mineral water or anything like that.

742
01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:13.920
casondra b: Yeah.

743
01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:15.090
Helena Rouhe: That's a different pace.

744
01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:27.870
casondra b: Yeah, I mean honestly there's times when I go like without it, like, especially during like work. It's always there. But there's like times when I was like drinking Gatorade. Instead, know that that's like a shit ton of sugar. It's just like

745
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:29.760
casondra b: Oh, no.

746
01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.850
Helena Rouhe: Like matter of mindfulness

747
01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:37.980
Helena Rouhe: And you paying attention to it. And I think it'll just be interesting for you as you develop this

748
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.180
Helena Rouhe: Awareness, what you notice

749
01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:52.620
casondra b: Yeah. Um, the other thing I was gonna say about like things to do, aside from the cross stitch projects, as I've definitely taught myself like how to do my own nails, which

750
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.000
casondra b: Mm hmm. Like I I'm not great at it or anything, but like I love

751
01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.110
casondra b: Banana little

752
01:26:58.290 --> 01:26:59.790
Helena Rouhe: Not an easy task.

753
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:01.800
Helena Rouhe: No it's not, especially here so

754
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.680
casondra b: Yeah, when you're doing with your non dominant hand, it's very different.

755
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:10.290
casondra b: And I like I have materials that are fine.

756
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.980
casondra b: And I do think that over time. I can, you know, if I if I just go slow enough I can like make whatever happened.

757
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:28.380
casondra b: Because I'm so familiar with the process just from having it done for so many years, but like I can tell that there's like, like I'm fucking up my natural nail beds.

758
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:42.360
casondra b: From over filing like I need to watch out for that. And I'm like, I don't know, there's like other things are difficult about it like I need. I would hate to have to get a different drill, but I might have to

759
01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:51.750
casondra b: But that's, like, another thing about this fucking backyard thing. I was like, I'm done. Now I can have some I wouldn't try to give myself some like crazy nails like I used to have. And like

760
01:27:52.860 --> 01:28:02.040
casondra b: If I were, if I were to do that. First of all, I've already like poke holes through the gloves that I have. And so it's like what, like you can imagine the gloves that I'm wearing that.

761
01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:03.270
casondra b: Right with dirt.

762
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:04.230
Helena Rouhe: Right.

763
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:13.320
casondra b: And so like if I were to go all out. I wouldn't even be able to get my hands and gloves or if I were to break one that would be very painful.

764
01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.690
casondra b: So what like

765
01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:18.270
casondra b: I feel like

766
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:23.010
casondra b: That yeah that shouldn't stop me from doing what I want to do.

767
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:38.430
Helena Rouhe: I think that you're in transition. And what you're used to doing is shifting a little bit. And there's a little bit of rebellion like through that this is the way it should be. Because this is the way it's always been

768
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:45.930
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. To what do I. Well, that just because it's always been that way, doesn't mean it has to stay that way because you make the choice.

769
01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:51.870
Helena Rouhe: Not because the choice is being put upon you, and I think maybe a little bit of the sky and these people kind of

770
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:59.220
Helena Rouhe: Putting themselves and inserting themselves in your project is feeling like they're kind of making things be a certain way, when

771
01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:05.910
Helena Rouhe: You don't actually that doesn't need to happen. It doesn't need to be anything on their agenda can continue to be

772
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:12.330
Helena Rouhe: That was your project is now done, you're going to do you can to maintain it and now you're going to put your focus on other things.

773
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:22.080
Helena Rouhe: And that may mean that you don't have longer nails, because it'll still be easier for you to keep this nail length and continue to maintain your project outside

774
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:31.200
casondra b: I hate. Maybe I hate this nail like and I there's a lot to do with like longer nails. I just can't put them in gloves and like I don't need to like maintain long

775
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:32.520
Helena Rouhe: Okay, well,

776
01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:37.680
Helena Rouhe: Then you can play around with these different things based on what you want to do and

777
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:47.340
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, you need to do so. You are the master of your own destiny and these things go ahead and tinker around with it, but please take care of nail beds, because that people

778
01:29:47.700 --> 01:30:01.380
casondra b: It's, it's hard. Well, when I took them off air already so thin and then like you have to bust them in order to get rid of the natural shine and then like I just locked him up because I didn't know what I was doing.

779
01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:09.990
casondra b: But I don't know it feels better to have like if they were exposed right now like oh my god would be so painful.

780
01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:13.080
casondra b: But it's not that bad with them on.

781
01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:17.070
casondra b: There, just like ugly. It's hard to get them all.

782
01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.250
casondra b: One length, um,

783
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.510
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, I would imagine.

784
01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:30.270
casondra b: Especially like you get one hand done and then you go to do the other hand, and like maybe I should start with my with my dog like doing it with my Non dominant hand because that's the one I struggle with.

785
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:35.340
casondra b: I feel like if I did that one first and then established like okay this is how long are going to be would

786
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.590
casondra b: Be easier to adjust

787
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:38.370
Sure.

788
01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:47.220
casondra b: Yeah, I don't know, there's like so much on YouTube. Like, I wonder what how people learn things before YouTube

789
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.760
casondra b: Like from

790
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.110
Entering

791
01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:58.170
Helena Rouhe: In person tutoring and education is now become the YouTube phnom I

792
01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:03.990
casondra b: Feel like maybe just like where people really doing ship by trial and error because that seems like

793
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:04.770
Helena Rouhe: Oh, yeah.

794
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:09.090
Helena Rouhe: We get done. Well, a lot of emergency room visits.

795
01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:14.400
casondra b: Okay. Speaking of hospitals, I read this book called

796
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:23.610
casondra b: The butchering art by Lindsay Fitz Harris or something and it talks and talks about

797
01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:29.280
casondra b: Like the emerged, like how they learn how to do surgeries and like what

798
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:33.900
Helena Rouhe: Oh yeah, that's a pretty. No wonder it's called the Turner.

799
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.620
Yeah.

800
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:41.820
casondra b: So she was on a I read her book and then like after that she was on a

801
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:47.040
casondra b: Podcast with Joe Rogan. I don't know if you know who that is meeting as

802
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:58.890
casondra b: She was on there and she was like showing pictures. And so of course I looked on her Instagram and she was like telling stories like oh god like they're like everybody that was really trial and error.

803
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.840
casondra b: That was like such

804
01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:06.960
Helena Rouhe: There is no communing with others on that. That was just let's see what happens if we do this.

805
01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.320
casondra b: Oh god, and there was like so many

806
01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:24.960
casondra b: Like there is this one story or this guy. He was like, really big. Really big surgeon like very strong and muscular and he was known for holding you down with one arm and then sawing off your limb within a

807
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:27.030
casondra b: Oh, with the other

808
01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:34.710
casondra b: Joseph listing or something like that. And then he like killed three people during this

809
01:32:36.090 --> 01:32:40.980
casondra b: Because I used to fucking like gather people in an auditorium and like watch them happen.

810
01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:41.310
Helena Rouhe: Right.

811
01:32:41.490 --> 01:32:41.910
casondra b: I know

812
01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:42.810
Have a pita.

813
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:46.860
casondra b: And so he he like had this

814
01:32:48.360 --> 01:33:00.030
casondra b: I don't know very crude surgical instrument that was that he would like a hold between his teeth as he switched it was so disgusting, no gloves, no nothing, and he killed the patient on the table.

815
01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:17.130
casondra b: He killed and then in the process of trying to take this person that the patient slim off. He cut off the finger of his assistant and then as he was trying to like reach around for his like a different rudimentary keep wanting to say weapon but instrument. He like

816
01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:22.050
casondra b: He like cut this guy who was like observing and all of them died of gangrene.

817
01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:23.460
Helena Rouhe: Oh my word.

818
01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.290
casondra b: And it just seems like, oh god.

819
01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:33.510
casondra b: That barbaric yeah it's, I mean, also, just like the people who would have multiple surgeries like

820
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:49.590
casondra b: Like people that would get shot in the face during war. There's like so many people that want so many, but there was quite a few people who like voluntarily went through a process where they like without anesthesia got surgery to their face.

821
01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:52.890
casondra b: I just I can't imagine

822
01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:01.830
casondra b: I don't know how it. I don't like it when I think about that kind of stuff I was doing shadow people or even alive today like childbirth.

823
01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:10.860
casondra b: Living like that's another thing like just childbirth on its own. Like I feel like that must have just been like 5050 you're gonna probably died during this

824
01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.160
casondra b: I feel like I would

825
01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:15.690
Helena Rouhe: Definitely worth back in the day.

826
01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:29.310
casondra b: Well, I feel like I would have killed my mom like if there, if not for modern medicine because I was I'm like 10 pounds nine ounces. I was two weeks late and they had, they had to give her a C section.

827
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:38.130
casondra b: She know she was like a big lady like six one. But I don't think you can. I don't think any person can pass and 11 pound baby.

828
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:40.560
Just

829
01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:46.230
Helena Rouhe: So you have survived and you didn't killer.

830
01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:47.640
casondra b: I mean, they

831
01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:48.450
Helena Rouhe: Had her own

832
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.580
Helena Rouhe: She had our own ideas about that.

833
01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:52.200
casondra b: Sure.

834
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:56.250
casondra b: Yeah.

835
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:08.370
casondra b: Sometimes like think about that. Like, it still hasn't like like she's dead. Yes, but the fact that she died of, like, oh, ethanol poisoning like to her organs and bloodstream. Like, that's just

836
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.580
casondra b: I'm not like surprise but like at the same time, it's just like, Whoa, you know,

837
01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.880
casondra b: That that's an extreme way to go.

838
01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:19.320
You know,

839
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:29.130
Helena Rouhe: So this is why you are developing a mindfulness process so that you can behave differently.

840
01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.440
casondra b: Yeah, I'm never going to be

841
01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:32.790
casondra b: No, I know.

842
01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:33.660
casondra b: I know

843
01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:44.250
Helena Rouhe: That it is you're just you're working to behave differently in many ways from your family dynamic, which is about awareness and understanding, but the exact opposite. Yeah.

844
01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.320
casondra b: It's definitely a motivator, that's for sure. Yeah, that's how I am choosing to see it.

845
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.180
Helena Rouhe: There you go. I like it.

846
01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:55.920
casondra b: Anyway, those are all the things that I wanted to talk about. So I'll let you go.

847
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:56.190
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

848
01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.550
Helena Rouhe: All right, well, sounds like you've got a good plan.

849
01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.800
Helena Rouhe: Yes. Take care.

850
01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:05.940
casondra b: Yes. Um, if I want to schedule another one. I'll just

851
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.510
Helena Rouhe: Let me know.

852
01:36:06.690 --> 01:36:08.850
Helena Rouhe: Okay. Sounds good. Okay.

853
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:09.960
Helena Rouhe: All right, bye. All right.
