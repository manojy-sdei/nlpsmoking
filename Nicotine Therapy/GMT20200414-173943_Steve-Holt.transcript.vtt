137
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.320

138
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:15.150
John Ashley: It's doing well made me really sleepy in the beginning, um, it's really starting to balance out now. Um, it's kind of not doing as much for me anymore.

139
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.510
John Ashley: Okay, with a pain with the two milligrams

140
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.060
John Ashley: And I'm putting a hoodie on I'm stepping outside. Just one second.

141
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:40.230
John Ashley: Sorry. So yes, it was doing really well, but now I mean it's still working but just starting to notice the pain coming back a little more

142
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:47.460
Steve Holtsford: Okay, and what else are you doing for pain are you doing ibuprofen or Tylenol or anything like that.

143
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.180
John Ashley: Um, ibuprofen, if it gets really bad, but other than that I normally don't take anything

144
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.820
Steve Holtsford: Okay. All right. And I imagine exercise helps and you haven't been able to do that.

145
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.440

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.660
Okay.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.430

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.790
Steve Holtsford: So if we go to

217
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.830
John Ashley: We go to

218
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.980
Steve Holtsford: You know, four milligrams

219
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.720

John Ashley: Day at 16

222
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.540
Steve Holtsford: And that's probably

223
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.550
John Ashley: And that's probably

224
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.840
Steve Holtsford: The dose that

225
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.920
Steve Holtsford: Most people are on

226
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.310
John Ashley: Those moving people around. Okay.

227
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.830
Steve Holtsford: And then we can you know as

228
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.900
Steve Holtsford: As the months go by, I think as

229
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.940
John Ashley: The months go by, I think.

230
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.180
Steve Holtsford: We can probably sort of

231
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.370
John Ashley: battling for

232
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.380

Steve Holtsford: I will wait

235
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.460
John Ashley: For that to the farmer. He waited for you. OK.

236
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.090
Steve Holtsford: And then so in terms of the bright hearts and

237
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.930
John Ashley: Then so

238
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.490
John Ashley: In terms of the bright heart stuff.

239
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.160
Steve Holtsford: You'll have me you'll have

240
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.330

242
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.240
John Ashley: There.

243
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.160
Steve Holtsford: And a case manager.

244
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.380
Steve Holtsford: Or manager.

245
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.270
John Ashley: It's called a care coordinator. I'm sorry.

246
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.730
John Ashley: It's called the care coordinator

247
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.650
Steve Holtsford: So we'll just kind of learn a scanner.

248
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.020
John Ashley: And we'll just kind of learn this together.

249
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:53.100
John Ashley: This is actually kind of familiar for me because I've been through therapy. My whole life I've always had three four doctors, you know, psychiatrists like

250
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.550
John Ashley: I just counselor, you know. So this is kind of

251
00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.990
John Ashley: Optimal for me, having, you know, bunch of doctors and stuff like that.

252
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.620
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, good and one, one thing that

253
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.380
Steve Holtsford: Also, does one thing that

254
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.270
John Ashley: Point heart also does

255
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.520
Steve Holtsford: Is they do have a chronic pain.

256
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.690
John Ashley: Sort of own sort of angle as well.

257
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.770
Steve Holtsford: So, and that's something that I've that I

258
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.660
John Ashley: am interested in it. Some

259
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.290
John Ashley: More of that.

260
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.350
John Ashley: Than I am interested to learn more about

261
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.400
Steve Holtsford: Rather than just the opioid

262
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:43.230
John Ashley: Yes, definitely sounds like it's just the opioid use this. Yeah. Well, it's because when I got out of surgery. They didn't want to prescribe me any medications and they wanted to put me on methadone.

263
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:58.200
John Ashley: And I didn't really have the best experience with methadone. I used it to detox before, but it wasn't something I wanted to be on on a regular basis. So that's why I chose Suboxone instead

264
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.800
Steve Holtsford: Got it. Yeah, Suboxone really is.

265
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.870
John Ashley: No one really is.

266
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.800
Steve Holtsford: Effective and say,

267
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:16.230
John Ashley: Oh yeah, it's done wonders for me it's, you know, I actually wake up and every day. I'm in pain, you know, no matter what I do.

268
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:37.770
John Ashley: I wake up and I'm in pain. I wake up I take my first strip. I go outside make my coffee smoke my cigarette within about 15 minutes, you know, my back pain. Starting to calm down my nerve pain in my hand. The burnings not as bad. And you know, I actually feel at a functional level. Yeah.

269
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.310
Good.

270
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.330
Steve Holtsford: The four milligrams for

271
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.230
John Ashley: Oftentimes,

272
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.190
John Ashley: The phone number and often times are hard to find.

273
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.320
Steve Holtsford: So you might have to cut an eight and a half.

274
00:18:50.280 --> 00:19:00.300
John Ashley: by phone, we might have to cut an eight and a half, okay, that's fine. If you just want to set an eight. I will just cut them in half and two a day and just split them in half.

275
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.420
Steve Holtsford: Sounds good. Okay.

276
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.100
Steve Holtsford: Have a great day.

277
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:05.970
Alright.

278
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.080
John Ashley: Have a great day. You too. Thank you so much.
