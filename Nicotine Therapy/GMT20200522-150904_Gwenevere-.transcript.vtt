00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.510
Daniel Guerrero: And so I just figured since I'm here.

21
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.600
Daniel Guerrero: Just we just had our meeting here instead of

22
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.740
Daniel Guerrero: Having to go back home and then having to come back or whatever the case may be.

23
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to hear a little bit about what made this week hard um

24
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.480
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so

25
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.600
Daniel Guerrero: So, last Friday.

26
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.390
Daniel Guerrero: About 130

27
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.940
Daniel Guerrero: I picked up my check from work.

28
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.860
Daniel Guerrero: And I was driving to the bank.

29
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.710
Daniel Guerrero: And I seen

30
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.520
Daniel Guerrero: What I had seen was I had seen these officers. They had this people pulled over, right.

31
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.360
Yeah.

32
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.710
Daniel Guerrero: Well,

33
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.330
Daniel Guerrero: They see me, are they seeing vehicle.

34
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.740
Daniel Guerrero: Because there's there's like two trucks in town that are almost spray painted the same like to see like

35
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.470
Daniel Guerrero: So my father in law. Let me just pick up. But before I got out of prison, someone had taken it spray painted it like blue and black, you know, just try to cover it up. So no one could recognize it.

36
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:28.470
Daniel Guerrero: But we ended up finding it. And so now it's painted blue and black. Oh, there's another vehicle that's exactly the same model that almost identical to mine now.

37
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know it's spray paint.

38
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.320
Daniel Guerrero: Well,

39
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.410
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I'm just thinking it was just like

40
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.460
Daniel Guerrero: Hey, say it a false false

41
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.740
Daniel Guerrero: Identity or whatever.

42
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Mistaken Identity.

43
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.570
Daniel Guerrero: There you go, mistaken identity and oh

44
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.000
Daniel Guerrero: Well, the officer.

45
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:59.040
Daniel Guerrero: Turns around sees me get to his vehicle leaves a person that he had pulled over and turns around, it comes, it pulls me over.

46
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.310
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, right. And so his reason for pulling me over that my brake lights weren't working

47
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.060
Daniel Guerrero: I was like, well, you know, it's kind of impossible because I just recently got them fixed, you know,

48
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

49
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.220
Daniel Guerrero: Well anyways, so the cases is that a

50
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.650
Daniel Guerrero: Right now I have

51
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:29.100
Daniel Guerrero: My license are suspended revoked because I gotta do lie in 2002 and New Mexico.

52
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:41.190
Daniel Guerrero: And the state of New Mexico, by law, it's mandatory that if you have a DWI that you get an interlock in your car. Well, I got a lot right I had gotten one and

53
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:56.040
Daniel Guerrero: But they wanted me to pay the reinstatement fee for my license. And then I had a ticket. When I was on the run. I went to the state of Iowa and I was up there and I got pulled over. This is how I end up getting caught. I got pulled over.

54
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.120
Daniel Guerrero: And already knew matters who were bad, so I didn't want to make them worse. So I just went ahead and pulled over.

55
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.830
Daniel Guerrero: And so

56
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:19.980
Daniel Guerrero: They gave me a ticket for no driver's license. Well, with that they put a suspension on my license, so that I could not get a license in the state and the nation. They put a nationwide suspension on my driver's license until I paid that ticket.

57
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.070
Daniel Guerrero: So I ended up going to jail.

58
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.070
Daniel Guerrero: Spent this horrible weekend.

59
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.900
Daniel Guerrero: And

60
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.770
Daniel Guerrero: Almost. I want to say almost like it almost took me back to where I was like, I'm just a failure just messing up you know

61
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.930
Daniel Guerrero: Because I saw the inside of that place or the

62
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.570
Daniel Guerrero: Where I just want to forget, you know, because like that's not me anymore, you know, and it was it was it was hard. It was pretty tough.

63
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.340
Daniel Guerrero: And then, you know, having to call my family from again the damn phone system that they have in there.

64
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.640
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I finally get out Monday.

65
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.770
Daniel Guerrero: You know, then

66
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.570
Daniel Guerrero: I get out my day. I had to open Tuesday.

67
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.620
Daniel Guerrero: And that's when I had to, you know, go to group, you know. No, no, that was tough for me, you know, because

68
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.240
Daniel Guerrero: You know i don't i don't like to not miss you know I like to stay

69
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.410
Daniel Guerrero: You know, on point.

70
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:32.160
Daniel Guerrero: And then, you know, then they call me into work, you know, and whatever, right, whenever I checked in virtual clinic.

71
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:41.100
Daniel Guerrero: My boss calls me, he's like, well, you know, Nicole. You know his daughter sick, she's having to take it to the emergency room. I need you to come in right away.

72
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:50.970
Daniel Guerrero: I said, Well, I'm about to have a doctor's appointment and you're just like, can you reschedule. I really need you here, and I'm just like, man, because he kind of made me on. You know what I mean. And I know

73
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.900
Daniel Guerrero: It now kind of just feel like know obligated.

74
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.350
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

75
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.730
Daniel Guerrero: Because we remember we talked about, um,

76
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.500
Daniel Guerrero: You know me feeling like I'm backed up in a corner. And now, like maybe, maybe I was just filling space here at work, but

77
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:20.460
Daniel Guerrero: I guess, I guess, I guess I just wasn't looking at the whole picture because you know through this whole time that I mean it was only four days that I was in jail, but for the four days that I was in jail.

78
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.570
Daniel Guerrero: You know they overlooked for my family, you know, is there anything guys need what Daniels gone, please let me know. You know, you know, whatever we can do to help

79
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.030
Daniel Guerrero: And well,

80
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.950
Daniel Guerrero: So when I get out my boss is like you know what's what's going to keep you out of jail, no.

81
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:52.170
Daniel Guerrero: And I, at first I kind of took it offensive because I'm like dude, I've been working here for a whole year. You know, I'm not like some car trouble maker. Right. And I said, what

82
00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:01.410
Daniel Guerrero: Do I say, What the hell do you mean what's going to keep me out of jail. Yeah. Like, I don't mean it like that. He was like, how can I help

83
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right.

84
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.940
Daniel Guerrero: So I was like, Now that may, you know, and so I apologize. I said, well,

85
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.930
Daniel Guerrero: I have this ticket in Iowa this you know

86
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.340
Daniel Guerrero: I want $500 that I need to pay so that way they can let the suspension, so I can get an interlock in my truck and

87
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:29.070
Daniel Guerrero: You know, see about hopefully get the interlock in my car, get the driver's test. Get the interlocking my car before court.

88
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:42.660
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, and hopefully you know present this to the judge a judge, look. Yes, I messed up. But this is what I've done to correct it. And, you know, maybe, maybe, just give me a fine or, you know, maybe just drop it, you know, and

89
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.800
Daniel Guerrero: Let me go on.

90
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.220
Daniel Guerrero: So that's that's that's been my week

91
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What did he say after that.

92
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.480
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, my boss.

93
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.590
Daniel Guerrero: He gave him the $500 to pay the ticket.

94
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.420
Really

95
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:01.950
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

96
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.490
Daniel Guerrero: So it's like

97
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.270
Daniel Guerrero: Whatever he did that.

98
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.400
Daniel Guerrero: Was like

99
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.180
Daniel Guerrero: My first thought was, at first I was like

100
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:25.080
Daniel Guerrero: I felt like I wasn't you know man enough to my own responsibilities. Right. You know, because I was just like, Damn, you know, that's my responsibility to pay that ticket not no one else's

101
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.000
Daniel Guerrero: And so then

102
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.100
Daniel Guerrero: He's all like

103
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.710
Daniel Guerrero: You know, let's just get it paid

104
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:41.370
Daniel Guerrero: And then what made me realize that he was looking out for his interest and not my interest is because he's like, I can't go another weekend without you.

105
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

106
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.110
Daniel Guerrero: I was like, all right, you know. So anyways,

107
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.180
Daniel Guerrero: So we got the ticket paid and, you know, they sent me

108
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.380
Daniel Guerrero: They sent me this paperwork, you know, showing day

109
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:05.250
Daniel Guerrero: They live. They live the suspension like it's like it's saying that they lift the suspension.

110
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

111
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.470
Daniel Guerrero: On my, on my driver's license.

112
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that.

113
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.890
Daniel Guerrero: So now that's, you know, that's a step forward and then so like

114
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.240
Daniel Guerrero: But

115
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.650
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I try not to have bad weeks I try not to let you know know we talked about that petty, you know, any stuff, you know, I try not to let that petty stuff bother me anymore.

116
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.270
Daniel Guerrero: You know, trying to become like more mature in that in that area because I used to be the worst with the petty crap you know and so

117
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:53.550
Daniel Guerrero: It's, it's been a long week say the least, because now I'm having to come in like an extra 30 minutes early, you know, 45 minutes early into work, you know, and make cover that because you know I missed, I missed three days I missed four days of my paycheck.

118
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.980
Daniel Guerrero: And so it's just like staying extra coming and extra

119
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.820
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, and now, and so he tells me he's like

120
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:14.100
Daniel Guerrero: Because I've been telling him, You know, for the past six months, seven months. I say we need to get a weekend crew to come in.

121
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:23.730
Daniel Guerrero: Because we're closed on Sunday. And I said, Come in and you know just clean up the restaurant, you know, like, I'm not saying that we haven't done a restaurant. What I'm saying is that, you know, there will be some deep

122
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.780
Deep

123
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.350
Daniel Guerrero: Right, so

124
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.190
Daniel Guerrero: Yesterday, he's all like remember

125
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:42.030
Daniel Guerrero: That a DVD, we've been talking about it and stuff. And I was like, yeah, so why don't you come in on Sundays and do that and

126
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.790
Daniel Guerrero: Was quite the money that you owe me

127
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.860
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so

128
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. No way. Right there.

129
00:11:48.990 --> 00:12:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What did now he that was open ended. He didn't say how many Sundays. He didn't say how long, so I want to know what you said after he said, and then we'll squash that $500 you owe me. What did you say

130
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:11.640
Daniel Guerrero: Well, my, my immediate response was, like, okay, you know, like, oh yeah, you know,

131
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.370
Daniel Guerrero: Um, but, you know, he wasn't. It wasn't a specific, you know,

132
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:25.950
Daniel Guerrero: He basically said this was no let's just get this, you know, cleaned up, you know, let's just get, you know, looking know

133
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.410
Daniel Guerrero: in top shape. You know, so

134
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:45.210
Daniel Guerrero: You know me personally, I've taken me personally, I'm thinking maybe you know five days. I mean, five, five hours on a Sunday, you know, come in at, you know, eight o'clock in the morning seven o'clock in the morning, go home by noon, so I can still have the rest of my day, you know,

135
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:52.740
Daniel Guerrero: And you know just keeping track of, you know, what I've done. And you know the hours. I've done yeah right away.

136
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.710
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

137
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.440
Daniel Guerrero: Of 50 hours.

138
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.360
Daniel Guerrero: Basically what I own the code of the $500

139
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.730
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because he's paying me 1025 an hour, I guess, something like that.

140
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:22.890
Daniel Guerrero: So, you know, something like 45 hours. I was what I owe him knows as far as cleaning, but there's not 45 hours worth of work to be done in here, you know,

141
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.730
Daniel Guerrero: So like the work that needs to be done is, you know, do some basic stuff, you know, maybe

142
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.230
Daniel Guerrero: You know, some extra scrubbing on the walls, you know, some extra you know

143
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.590
Daniel Guerrero: Stuff like that, you know, but

144
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:48.120
Daniel Guerrero: To me it to me. I'm kind of I'm grateful for it, you know, because I probably would have been able to do it otherwise. And I would have probably went to court with the judge and Ben like

145
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:54.240
Daniel Guerrero: And he would have been like, all right, you're going to jail for seven days because in the state of New Mexico. It's a mandatory seven days driving on a

146
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.780
Daniel Guerrero: Suspended revote license.

147
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.680
Daniel Guerrero: So, you know, it's

148
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.600
Daniel Guerrero: It's extremely heavy for me because

149
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:15.240
Daniel Guerrero: It's something that I don't want to have to me personally relive but the same time my kids have to relive it like

150
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:25.200
Daniel Guerrero: You know, on the 20th on the 20th of this month, you know, I was out for a whole year for a prison planet. Make it because on the 18th. I went to jail.

151
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it counts. Oh, cut it out, it counts jails, not the same as president. Come on now.

152
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't mess with yourself, don't undo what you did, don't do it.

153
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's not the same. Come on, really, no.

154
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

155
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.160
Daniel Guerrero: I'm sorry you froze up on me.

156
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you froze. Um,

157
00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know that anniversary means a lot to you but you know that prison is not the same as a county jail.

158
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.030
Daniel Guerrero: Right well

159
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.840
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, but I just I just kind of feel like

160
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.270
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just me going to jail. I mean, even though, even though it's just for like a civil infraction, you know, like, you know, without a license, whatever.

161
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.480
Daniel Guerrero: To me was a big deal because you know that's something that I didn't want you know to present to my family again did

162
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.300
Daniel Guerrero: Dad. Sorry for

163
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.460
Daniel Guerrero: Me, you know,

164
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.530
Daniel Guerrero: My kids.

165
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.690
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

166
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You said our connections kind of crummy you said your, your kids kind of freaked out a little bit. What would they say

167
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:40.980
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

168
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.150
Daniel Guerrero: I probably shouldn't you know this, you know, just

169
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.270
Daniel Guerrero: It just kind of like open my eyes and paint a day to you know what's going on around me.

170
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.760
Daniel Guerrero: But I feel like, but I feel like I got you know I got pretty good shape going on.

171
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:05.400
Daniel Guerrero: Think, at least, you know, look, you know, I haven't, I haven't been touched in any pills and so long. You know, I've had extra money.

172
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.350
Daniel Guerrero: You know, good things that my kids need, you know, to, you know, help

173
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:18.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know, pay our bills on. I'm like, you know, I was letting my I was loading my legs to go climate seven

174
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.190
Daniel Guerrero: Me on it and I'm trying to catch up and trying to catch it and trying to catch up and work today, you know,

175
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.820
Daniel Guerrero: I paid my electricity bill. And for now, you know,

176
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.040
Daniel Guerrero: $120

177
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.380
Daniel Guerrero: And boom, you know. And to me, it's to me. It's like a big progress because we've, you know, this is something I've never done before you

178
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.870
Daniel Guerrero: Know, so

179
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:56.400
Daniel Guerrero: The last thing I wanted to get her go still amuses home old house meter in my house. You know, I learned how to become electrician by doing shit like that excuse my language. But you know, I became a plumber because

180
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.890
Daniel Guerrero: For my water off.

181
00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

182
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:07.530
Daniel Guerrero: When I went and did is I went and illegally turned it back on, you know, I cut the law or they took the whole meter at one time.

183
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:23.490
Daniel Guerrero: And all it all it takes is a two inch fitting in a an inch and no one, three quarters fitting and you and you put them together. Well, they can't take the little, the little nozzle out or they can take us Demeter out

184
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

185
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.530
Daniel Guerrero: So I hope those two things I turned a little water back on and I have water leak illegally.

186
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:31.890
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

187
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got it.

188
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

189
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.450
Daniel Guerrero: No.

190
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. So you're trying to do this, this life legit and and there's, there's, there's some pride in it to that you're doing it.

191
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

192
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:50.790
Right.

193
00:17:53.970 --> 00:18:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm gonna, I'm going to say, let's take your video off for just a little bit, just because we're having some difficulty here.

194
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And there

195
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.280
Daniel Guerrero: Was one way

196
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.520
Daniel Guerrero: Should I call you right back.

197
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: No, let's just, I'm just now, just take you off video poker stop video for a second, I, I've tried it twice. You're going to have to do it because it's not working on my end just yeah there we go.

198
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um,

199
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel if what I'm hearing is you've got to put together 50 hours and then it's clear.

200
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You can certainly write it down, keep track of it have him sign in each week say just trying to really make sure I'm staying up to date with it so that there's no confusion at the end. I'm so grateful for the help, like I didn't have that lump sum. I'm really appreciative.

201
00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's it. So there's that 50 that that those 50 hours you know you've got it on a piece of paper.

202
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But I started to write down a couple of things I wrote down a goal of I need an interlock and I wrote down get driver's license, but I don't know if those are things that you want on your treatment plan. I can take them right back out.

203
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they like I need to get the interlock. Is that something that you do want to do

204
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.460
Daniel Guerrero: Now, that's, that's something that was most definitely gonna have to be done.

205
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.200
I went

206
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.390
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I have court. I have I have court June 9

207
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.210
Daniel Guerrero: So we're. I mean, we're just days away. You know, like two weeks.

208
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.690
Daniel Guerrero: What 17 days away. Maybe

209
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So where do you go to get it. What do you have to do to go

210
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:47.790
Daniel Guerrero: Well, actually.

211
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:54.060
Daniel Guerrero: It's right next door to it's right next door to my job. So when I get off the phone with you.

212
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.610
Daniel Guerrero: Want to set up an appointment with this guy next door.

213
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there we go.

214
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.130
Daniel Guerrero: And then

215
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:01.380
Daniel Guerrero: And then also

216
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:09.930
Daniel Guerrero: So you can't get into the DMV without an appointment. So the second I got out of Joe I called the DMV and Santa Fe.

217
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.480
Daniel Guerrero: And

218
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.220
Daniel Guerrero: I had to set up an appointment through them. Okay, so

219
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.500
Daniel Guerrero: June 1

220
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:20.940
Six.

221
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:32.280
Daniel Guerrero: Years. They finally open up the DMV, but it's like I said appointment only so when they open up the DMV. It's already scheduled. You know, so

222
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.430
Daniel Guerrero: The earliest word

223
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's an appointment of the third. So the third is

224
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Wednesday and what time is it out on the third. Do you remember

225
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.890
Daniel Guerrero: That's a 232 30

226
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And your, your boss knows about the 230 appointment and he knows about court on the night

227
00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.220
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

228
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good, good, good, good.

229
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

230
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So now what about driver's license. That's the, that's the DMV piece right

231
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.720
Daniel Guerrero: Right so so

232
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:25.500
Daniel Guerrero: I'm guessing what they're going to want to do is they're going to want to like want me to come in because it's how it worked last time I went and told them that I need to work on an interlock license.

233
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.970
Daniel Guerrero: He had me take your driver's test.

234
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:38.280
Daniel Guerrero: I took the driver's test than I had, and after passing the driver's test, they gave me this b&b

235
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:48.930
Daniel Guerrero: Yet to go online schedule an appointment for them to come in and do that driven, you know, because you can't do it in the same day.

236
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:55.380
Daniel Guerrero: For whatever reason you can't do it in the same day not never seen that before. And, but

237
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:03.420
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, vicious maybe because this DMV is so small that they have to like do that so they can have like a scheduled appointment, whatever, because

238
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:13.200
Daniel Guerrero: When I was in Texas in Lubbock, I went into the driver's test 30 minutes later I was on the road, taking the risk the driving part of it, you know.

239
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.320
Daniel Guerrero: I took the written part. Then I took the drivers part I got my driver's license that day. You know, so

240
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.400
Daniel Guerrero: I don't get it. How they work here, but that's the way they do it.

241
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you are already moving forward. You know, we're going to do when you get off of the zoom meeting with me.

242
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that you and I can process is just getting it all off your chest about this idea that is the fear that your kids view you in a negative way is that the biggest emotional obstacle or is it how you're viewing yourself.

243
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.700
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

244
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.970
Daniel Guerrero: I guess I'm going to try to, I want to try and move closer to my

245
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.050
Daniel Guerrero: Move closer to the building.

246
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.520
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, are you

247
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.010
Daniel Guerrero: Sure. Can you hear me okay

248
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear you.

249
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:20.730
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, well I just because at the end of what you were saying you were breaking up so I couldn't understand me.

250
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Too bad.

251
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.340
Daniel Guerrero: So john

252
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.710
Daniel Guerrero: I apologize, I repeat,

253
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.330
Daniel Guerrero: Them at home right

254
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, are you able to hear me fluidly

255
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me.

256
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes so so Daniel. My question is, is the is the biggest stressor for you right now on an emotional level what your children family think of you, or is the biggest challenge what you think of you.

257
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.660
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, I just

258
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.380
Daniel Guerrero: I think i think you know 90% of that is you know myself, you know, because I

259
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.210
Daniel Guerrero: Don't wanna. I don't want to go to that.

260
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:17.370
Daniel Guerrero: I don't have to go through that whole process of getting back into the system.

261
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:30.960
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I've never been, it's been 12 years since I've been out of the system. Well 13 years. Now this past year made 13 years, you know, finally I have, I mean 12 years and the system one year out

262
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:43.830
Daniel Guerrero: And here I am again, possibly a chance of maybe getting probation or, you know, some unsupervised. You know, deal at the magistrate court where, you know,

263
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.990
Daniel Guerrero: But it's my first offense on driving on revocation.

264
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

265
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.570
Daniel Guerrero: It's my, my first offense.

266
00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. Keep in mind if if it turns out that you need to include that you are, you're in, you're in a program if it turns out that that looks good, make sure

267
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I connect on that level where you get a release of information and I can write a letter saying you're participating in a program. It turns out that that's helpful. Sometimes the court system likes that.

268
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it sounds like what you're doing is

269
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel

270
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The deal here you you broke some laws in the past.

271
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it didn't happen. This didn't happen overnight and and and and you're paying a price.

272
00:25:48.900 --> 00:26:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's catching up. And so what. So, okay, fine. You know what I did some things. I'm not proud of, um, I couldn't just walk right out of prison. I didn't have, you know, I'm not independently wealthy. I couldn't just pay off at $500 couldn't go get the interlock I've had some challenges.

273
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't have to just be you coming down on yourself. It's not what's defining and what defines you is what you do at this moment. All you have to do is when you leave me. You just go to the next right thing. The next right thing will happen. Don't complicate it with self doubt.

274
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.640
Daniel Guerrero: And you know that's and that's the part that's a part of the part of it, you know, because

275
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:44.340
Daniel Guerrero: Like I try not to be so doubtful. You know, I try not to be so hard on myself. You know, so I've come to realize that you know what i'm so hard on myself. It's just like more stressful. You know, it's just like

276
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.760
Daniel Guerrero: Now always trying to please everybody.

277
00:26:50.010 --> 00:27:02.550
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's hard. You know, it's difficult, because you know i want i want to please the kids. I want to please my wife, you know, I want to, I want to, you know, please. The my employer, you know. So for me, it's

278
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.790
Daniel Guerrero: It's a big deal. You know, like I try not

279
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.510
Just

280
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.130
Daniel Guerrero: Its kind of heavy, you know, and it's not just something you know

281
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:22.350
Daniel Guerrero: That you can just talk to about anybody you know and that's why, that's why I'm kind of thankful for these you know sessions, because

282
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:30.930
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I even tried to talk to this about to my wife, and you know, and of course you know she's all like, Oh, you're doing all the right things. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, but

283
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.920
Daniel Guerrero: At the end of the day is like what she even really listening, you know, because we're watching TV. The kids are yelling or, you know, or something, you know, you hear me.

284
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it.

285
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.170
Yeah.

286
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:49.500
Daniel Guerrero: And so so honestly like those this conversation. You know, it can come out, you know, the way it's supposed to come out.

287
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.440
Daniel Guerrero: I can get the feedback that I need to get back, you know, or because you know

288
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.420
Daniel Guerrero: I don't wanna. I don't want to

289
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.040
Daniel Guerrero: Just a lot, you know, I

290
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Will get it off your test Daniel just you just went through a really stressful event and you're still in it. Just get it all out. Let me listen to you. Let me hear you.

291
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.450
Daniel Guerrero: So it's only that to, you know, is because, you know,

292
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:35.850
Daniel Guerrero: It's a lot then my dad, you know, my guys kind of sick too so that that puts a little bit of stress on me to, you know, you know, because I know

293
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.400
Daniel Guerrero: Growing up, growing up.

294
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.790
Daniel Guerrero: I never really knew my real dad until I turned like 25 I met my real dad.

295
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.160
Daniel Guerrero: And so

296
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:54.660
Daniel Guerrero: Like actually met him, madam, you know, like sat down, had a nice conversation Jenner taught

297
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.710
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, and so now he'll be in a hospital.

298
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.760
Daniel Guerrero: Know my mom so

299
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.520
Daniel Guerrero: It's kind of know going along ways to everything is

300
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:12.600
Daniel Guerrero: So,

301
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how is it making you feel that this dad that you just met basically just getting to know him just met him, and now he's in the hospital. What is it making me think about

302
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.130
Daniel Guerrero: Oh you know that's that's

303
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.460
Daniel Guerrero: That's kind of rolling for me because like I don't know how to feel emotionally. You know, like

304
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:41.880
Daniel Guerrero: Because, you know, part of me, you know, Lowes, my dad you know me, I love him, you know, because you gave me life. You know, it's my dad, my father, whatever.

305
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:53.850
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he came down a couple weekends ago my mom came down couple weekends ago and it was like so great. It was like

306
00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:05.220
Daniel Guerrero: I actually had, you know, like a dad, you know, not like a stepfather. There was always, you know, down my ass and know you're never going to be perfect. You know, he's like,

307
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:15.150
Daniel Guerrero: And my, my dad was just like, Now son, you really got things going on, you know, you're looking good. You're looking healthy families. Looking good.

308
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.280
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and

309
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.280
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I came down for Mother's Day.

310
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:29.340
Daniel Guerrero: And so it was, it was really nice to know and then my mom went home. So she called me the next day and

311
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.710
Daniel Guerrero: She was saying, do you know how proud. My dad was on me because

312
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:44.970
Daniel Guerrero: I got to remind you that my dad has never seen me and you know having this much progress is always seen the addicted Daniel addicted.

313
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.480
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, no fun, you know,

314
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.300
Daniel Guerrero: So it kind of, you know, it was refreshing, you know, to, you know, hear my mom. Tell me know that I get to do so proud of me and

315
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:04.530
Daniel Guerrero: That because I never really had you know that, you know, I, well, I've always had his

316
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.020
Daniel Guerrero: Amount to share

317
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:19.620
Daniel Guerrero: And now it's like that right there is is like kind of what's holding me together is because you know it's tough, because I don't want to lose everything that I've gained

318
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:30.870
Daniel Guerrero: And I've only been out one year I've only been out one year and the one year that I have been out, you know, when I first got out know the kids were sky FT or like child protective services.

319
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:31.920
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

320
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:47.400
Daniel Guerrero: My wife was messing up ever. That's a whole different story. But anyway, so when I came home, you know, that was a progress that we had to do you know so I had to fight and fight and fight to get to where I'm where I'm at today and I just don't want to lose it behind

321
00:31:49.350 --> 00:32:09.090
Daniel Guerrero: A citation or, you know, get put on probation and here I am sucked back into a system that continues, you know, that's, I believe it's there to help people. But at the same time, it hasn't ever helped me don't think it's ever given me was my was my DLC number renewed and

322
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.360
Daniel Guerrero: So it's

323
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, Daniel. This is where

324
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the thinking can change.

325
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel

326
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If you catastrophizing if it turns out they put you on some sort of supervision.

327
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter that nothing. It's not going to be inconvenient. Yeah. Yeah. It'll be inconvenient the data you get to decide how much meaning that has I I say

328
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm paying for some things that I did in my past. And as much as I don't like it. I did do some things. And this is, this is how it's rolling out. I am going to focus on the present.

329
00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: If you beat yourself up all of what you have worked for. It'll. It'll fade away really fast.

330
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:10.320
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah, and I agree with that. So whenever I got out of prison.

331
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.410
Daniel Guerrero: My wife had gone to jail because she was driving on revocation as well. Right.

332
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:23.550
Daniel Guerrero: So she went to jail. And they ended up giving her one year probation.

333
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.040
Daniel Guerrero: It was supervised, but it's just like a misdemeanor probation.

334
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.110
Daniel Guerrero: Right and

335
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:37.020
Daniel Guerrero: And it went by so fast like next month. I think she gets off my

336
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Desk fast right

337
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.760
Daniel Guerrero: So, I mean, the year went by so quick and

338
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.360
Daniel Guerrero: But the whole thing is

339
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.550
Daniel Guerrero: Is I don't think I need that restraint. You know, I don't think that I need. I don't think I need that a supervision.

340
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.430
Daniel Guerrero: No, but

341
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.410
Daniel Guerrero: For whatever reason,

342
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.840
Daniel Guerrero: Now I feel like I'm going to go back into that supervision, you know, it's kind of tough for me.

343
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.800
Yeah.

344
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel, the meaning that it's making for you. The fact just imagine you're back on supervision, maybe even an ankle bracelet. What a pain in the ass.

345
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what Daniel. It's what you do with that event that is going to make or break your future. If you catastrophizing meaning it's the end of the world. I'm back in the system systems never done anything for me. Screw it. I'll never make it on the outside. If you do that,

346
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Every other decision you make, is going to be this negative

347
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Minimization of all the effort if you do it differently, Daniel. If you just say, Okay, I'm going to do everything I can to prevent that supervision, but if it happens.

348
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say to myself, you know what I'm paying for some things that I did in the past. Whatever, I'll get through this.

349
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know what, I also I lost heating and I learned how to be a plumber.

350
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I lost my electricity. And I learned about electricity. I've also been able to take a really crummy situation and I've been able to turn it around and learn from it all. This is just another opportunity because the alternative, Daniel.

351
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going back to that life if you if you get sucked back in to that. I can't do it. I'm like legit kind of life. I can't do it. Look, it's it's it's set up to fail.

352
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get that thinking in your head. I'm afraid you're, you're going to throw your hands up and say, I'm just forget it's not worth it. That's my fear.

353
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.240
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I was thinking about that too. You know, because of

354
00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.830
Daniel Guerrero: This last time that I was on probation I seemed like that everything that I was trying to do right came out wrong. You know,

355
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:18.510
Daniel Guerrero: Of course, when I got out, you know, I was doing great doing great. Can I got some pills and then I couldn't find the pills, you know, the doctor wasn't writing my script anymore. I couldn't find the pills on the street. So I ended up using some math.

356
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:25.950
Daniel Guerrero: And then it just snowballed from there, you know, just went from bad to worse to

357
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.950
Daniel Guerrero: Prison and

358
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.060
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, I know today that I got a stronger head on my shoulders, you know,

359
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:40.380
Daniel Guerrero: It's just, to me, as I just don't want to have to go through that crap. Again, you don't have to

360
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:47.880
Daniel Guerrero: Deal with all that and and I knew, I knew this was something that was going to catch up to me because you know the signs were

361
00:36:48.510 --> 00:37:00.810
Daniel Guerrero: The signs were everywhere you know my I had my mom. Have you worked on your driver's license. You know, I had you know i i see i would see people around me driving without tail lights. I'm like, oh, they're going to get pulled over, you know, and

362
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:19.950
Daniel Guerrero: Okay. And, you know, so it's like I seen the signs were and I had the opportunity to call this place and arrange $25 a month. They could have taken that take it off in my license, you know, and I could I could have done it. But I just

363
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know, laziness and not willing to

364
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:30.270
Daniel Guerrero: Pay that damn ticket. You know, I'm doing just fine. You know, and no

365
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.370
Daniel Guerrero: Because of that,

366
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:43.500
Daniel Guerrero: Position that I am and I just wonderful. Thank you, am I messing up knows

367
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel, you're not messing up if you can settle. You're almost there, right, you've almost got this settled thought which is

368
00:37:52.020 --> 00:38:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I ignored the early signs that I needed to hold myself accountable. I just ignored them. I won't do it today because all you have to do. There's nothing else any of us can do

369
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I, I, not that you're looking for pride for me. Certainly not, but I am I'm proud of you. And you guys don't get how hard you're working on a daily basis.

370
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to be able to pay bills on time to not be you know in in an abusive relationship to not be back using drugs. Again, it is a testament to how much you want this growth, how much you want a healthy family Daniel you're working hard every day don't minimize that.

371
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.790
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I really appreciate that, you know,

372
00:38:49.680 --> 00:39:03.900
Daniel Guerrero: Because, you know, it's, you know, I see, I see the progress. I'm just like, you know, one day to day how much progress. My actually making and it's not that I'm looking, you know, I'm looking for a pat on the back. Every, every five minutes of my

373
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.450
Daniel Guerrero: Day, because it's not something that

374
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:25.440
Daniel Guerrero: I'm looking, I'm looking for. I just, I just want to make sure at the end of the day, you know that my family is set, you know, and because you know I'm not getting any younger, you know. Shit, I'll be 41 and just, you know, few more months and I'm just like, you know, where is it time going

375
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.570
Daniel Guerrero: On it's so

376
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. Here's the deal. If what life just did. Was it said, Get off your ass. If that's what just happened. If that's all this is

377
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Just imagine it's just that it's not some big, you know, I'm a bad man and Baba, Baba. What if all this is was I ignore the signs and to get off my ass.

378
00:39:52.020 --> 00:40:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to stop talking and just doing if I say I want to go get this license. I'm going to get it.

379
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: If I say I'm going to, I want to get these 50 hours down. I want to pay him off. Maybe I'll have my wife come and do it with me. That'll drop it into half

380
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Will will basically she'll be paying down that debt to will knock it out. We'll get it done that's in your solution. If you go into remorse and regret and beating the crap out of yourself.

381
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to have a depressed man as a client and I'm going to have a man that's going to be thinking about using again, I don't want it. I want you to be proud of what you're doing.

382
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this thing is just a, it's just a kick in the ass. So what I couldn't get you to. I couldn't kick your ass. Your mom couldn't kick your ass right we can't get you to see.

383
00:40:45.390 --> 00:41:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's just one inconvenient nuisance. Oh my gosh. Life is full of these, we got to make these calls we got to show up and do these these stupid $25 things that that's just life. It's not like we all have these things you're describing their, their pain in the butt.

384
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.090
Daniel Guerrero: Right, right.

385
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:08.370
Daniel Guerrero: I just

386
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.190
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know,

387
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:19.380
Daniel Guerrero: My, my plate my plate was, you know, heavy at one time, you know, because probation and trying

388
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:33.000
Daniel Guerrero: To do the right thing. And now, and now that I'm there. You know, I just I just know. I don't know if I want to fill it with probation in jail again, you know, because my life. My life is full right now. You know, I don't have time for those

389
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:34.980
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

390
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.070

Daniel Guerrero: Don't have to go to do some na. Are you gonna have to go and you know

Daniel Guerrero: Do some extra you know classes, whatever, you know, just classes or we're going to put you in, you know, who knows what they're going to say, you know, because I because you know that that DWI was in 2002 I was just a kid, I was 22 years old and I got it.

396
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.700
Daniel Guerrero: You know, here I am 18 years later, and I'm still paying for it because I hadn't taken care of it.

397
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:27.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know, but I what I did do what I did do though is, as I did.

398
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.160
Daniel Guerrero: Trying to remember. Not if I if I completed a DWI class.

399
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.750
Daniel Guerrero: While I was in prison, I'd have to go back and look at my
