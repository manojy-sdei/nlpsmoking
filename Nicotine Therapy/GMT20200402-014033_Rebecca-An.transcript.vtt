1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was weird.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.810
ethant: I don't know what happened.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:16.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My internet went completely down and then when it came back up my computer tried to connect to it and it assigned itself, its own IP address. So it was really weird very weird.

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I had trouble logging back on weird

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Today, the internet. I don't know what is happening.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: clients have been having issues all day long. Getting logged in and getting logged on

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So anyway.

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.840
ethant: I bet the of the infrastructure is kind of tax because so many people are using the internet from home, like all day long.

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Schools work everything you know way more than what it's normally being used. So,

10
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. So anyways, what we're used telling me.

11
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.430
ethant: What was I telling you

12
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:13.260
ethant: I was telling you that I was using the Adderall is kind of a crutch that works in some ways and doesn't work in other ways. Like, it gives me super focus, which, which is great. And it gives me

13
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.970
ethant: Getting out of the present moment.

14
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.060
ethant: To so I don't

15
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.520
ethant: I don't feel the

16
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.670
ethant: Just that are like

17
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.950
ethant: This is the other like chaos.

18
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.080
ethant: Of it, you know, it's, I get some relief from that.

19
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.420
ethant: Um,

20
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.870
ethant: But then I'm not actually like as we discussed before, I'm not actually doing my best work or anything. It's kind of like

21
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.920
It. I

22
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.880
ethant: Have that attic thinking where I'm like I did this situation is so fucked up. I deserve a way to get through this without, you know,

23
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.490
ethant: Without being like

24
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.600
ethant: Can without having to confront reality.

25
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.150
And that's

26
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a way to think, yeah, it's not. No.

27
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.810
ethant: Well, it's like, it is a way to think, but it's ultimately it won't work. You know, I can't go through life.

28
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.230
ethant: And whenever there's a

29
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.590
ethant: Situation. That's this

30
00:02:46.560 --> 00:03:00.510
ethant: Like sad and chaotic and uncomfortable and you know unclear and all the things that it is I shouldn't be like, Oh, well I can just get, you know, I can handle it just by taking a bunch of drugs.

31
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, the idea is you know for you to

32
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Abstain from using anything

33
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:21.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know at this point to help you get back on your feet. Right. It's not to rely on a different substance, because I it's really counterproductive. If you think about it.

34
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:33.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and you know when you weigh it out the cost and the benefits. Is it really helping you in the long run, or is it causing more issues than it normally would.

35
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.060
ethant: haven't written it out. I like to think it would kind of be 5050 but probably, in reality, it would be a net loss.

36
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

37
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:05.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well net loss. Yeah. You know, I guess, you know, there's this other piece to that says, How is it you know you're you've got a couple months left at this employer and

38
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you want it to end.

39
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:23.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, do you want it to ending chaos or do you want it to end on good terms, you know. And so really kind of again the cost and benefit analysis of it and really

40
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking a look at to what benefits, you're gaining from it, you know, versus

41
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The cost. Yeah.

42
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.550
ethant: Yeah.

43
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:51.750
ethant: As as of tonight. I'm like, doing all this. It's not a miracle worker anything. I'm just setting up these meetings, I'm talking to all the people that I'm supposed to talk to and then starting tomorrow. It's going to be

44
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.870
ethant: You know, probably, where we should have been at the beginning of the week that

45
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.150
But

46
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.180
ethant: That feels good.

47
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.170
ethant: And I think I need to make a personal like

48
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:15.000
ethant: Deadline Lauren. It's kind of hard to stop mid week I mean anything's possible. I absolutely could do it, but I was thinking I would

49
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.850
ethant: Kind of keep doing this until I get through this week and then spend the weekend.

50
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.680
ethant: sobering up and I could I could appear chipper and sober at our Monday. Monday group.

51
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And answer all kinds of questions on what happened this week.

52
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.770
ethant: Yeah.

53
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It kind of it right

54
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So after this. The, the plan and commitment is to

55
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not right. Yeah.

56
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.810
ethant: Yeah, I don't wanna. I don't want to live my life this way, like on an ongoing basis. I want to

57
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.620
ethant: I want to get through a large a lot of hard stuff that's coming out of and I don't want to do it with a crutch.

58
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:21.090
ethant: It'll come out worse if I if I do it with my surprise if you use crutches like this. This is just one little mini part of it. I mean, there's the job search, you know,

59
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:28.620
ethant: You know, it has all the same features of, like, I gotta impress these people. I gotta

60
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.300
ethant: You know I gotta do Herculean demo projects that will

61
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.520
ethant: Impress them so much, you know, how did he possibly get that all done in this amount of time.

62
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.350
ethant: So all the temptations are going to be there, but I'm going to have to learn how

63
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.210
ethant: To

64
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.910
ethant: You know they have

65
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.770
ethant: To do the math to be you know know as tempting as that might sound. It's just going to make things worse.

66
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is Lily say about it.

67
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.750
ethant: She

68
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.020
ethant: Is obviously concerned about my job. My job is in a weird position where

69
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:28.560
ethant: Like I keep screwing up and this is screwing up pretty bad, like sleeping through meetings and, you know, failing to get basic stuff set up for that involves a bunch of people this week.

70
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.930
ethant: So I'm really not performing

71
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.490
ethant: Well at the job and so she's worried like, are you, you know,

72
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.460
ethant: Is the Java my suddenly going to get fired and then we'll be

73
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.240
ethant: In Job Search mode sooner than we expected.

74
00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:04.380
ethant: Other than that, you kind of rolls with it, she she she's very clear with her with her disappointment. Like when I I don't hide it from her and she's you know I tell her what I'm doing and she

75
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.090
ethant: sits me down, and she tells me, really, sincerely. The how deeply like disappointed. She is that that you know

76
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.870
ethant: That I've let let things go this way.

77
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.660
ethant: But on the other hand, she's not like leaving the house. She's not

78
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.170
ethant: You know she's not actively like trying to find my drugs and throw them out or anything like that.

79
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's just letting you handle it and deal with it you know she's

80
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.670
ethant: So she's kind of hands off in that regard.

81
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

82
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can see you know why she would take that stance, you know. Yeah.

83
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

84
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.350
ethant: Yeah, she's learned. She's been around my this my behavior long enough to know that.

85
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.090
I'm

86
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.430
ethant: That you can't control it, you know, she has an interesting sort of Eastern European mindset where

87
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.500
ethant: You should be able to apply for not force exactly but like influence on a person

88
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:24.060
ethant: And ultimately control them, and she should be able to achieve in her culture. It's like, you should be able to

89
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:38.520
ethant: Do whatever it takes, you know, in prison, somebody in their own house basically to like keep them from from doing you know whatever this destructive thing they're doing

90
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is

91
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:52.650
ethant: They can actually do that in Russia. It's funny that or it's interesting because we have all of our personal freedoms laws over here. So, like when you go to rehab. Here you have to agree to to go to rehab and that's not the case in Russia.

92
00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:03.060
ethant: The family can get together and decide like this you know so and so, needs to be in rehab and he doesn't have any personal choice in the matter. I don't know exactly how the laws work out but

93
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

94
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wonder how

95
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:23.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What the statistics show as far as success rate as far as people staying getting sober staying server, you know, in that type of culture, right.

96
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Interesting. I'm gonna have to research that now. Thank you.

97
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.350
ethant: Yeah, check it out. It's also interesting because they have a very sort of

98
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:42.330
ethant: You know the machismo, kind of thing that uh like Latin American cultures have yeah the guys in in

99
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.650
ethant: Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe. Definitely have

100
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.500
That quality.

101
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

102
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.060
ethant: I don't know.

103
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.770
ethant: Maybe they have some success cases I

104
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:01.020
ethant: Would think that if you put someone in one of those programs against their will and they're so proud about

105
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.090
ethant: You know, running their life the way that they want and then it would be hard.

106
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

107
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:17.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Well, I know it's hard to convince somebody to go to rehab, you know, to want to go.

108
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, nobody wants to go to rehab, that's for sure.

109
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you doing on your Benz's

110
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:42.690
ethant: So I have the ones that Mary prescribed to me. I've taken just I've taken less than, you know, one a day she basically gave me 30 and more or less wrote it. So it's like one a day.

111
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.940
ethant: Um, but I also got some Xanax from my

112
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.280
ethant: From my

113
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.440
ethant: My dealer and I have been taking those, I would say like

114
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.600
ethant: And I'm trying not to go overboard with it, but I haven't taken like

115
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.360
ethant: Two bars, a day.

116
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For how many days.

117
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.270
ethant: For the past, whatever week that this has been going on.

118
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long are you planning on taking those daily

119
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.370
ethant: I want to stop taking those and start

120
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.620
The the

121
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:39.750
ethant: The path to getting on track seems pretty straightforward because I've been continuing to take the the Suboxone and I'm pretty you know made all this chaos. But so, my life, my day routines are all messed up, but

122
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:47.490
ethant: Basically I've been taking strictly one strip you know per day. I cut it up in pieces.

123
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:57.390
ethant: I i've been successful is there are also temptations of like Uber. You know, I can get back in, but I don't want it. You know, so

124
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.420
ethant: The path to getting back on track is to like stop taking the Adderall stop taking the

125
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.200
The Xanax and switch to

126
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.860
ethant: The mountain most moderate possible

127
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:23.580
ethant: You know dosage that I can from the ones that Mary gave me

128
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:36.060
ethant: I expect a little bit. There's the Xanax, like the ones that I get. They're not like knock your socks off. They're not like super high dosage or anything so

129
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So milligram

130
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's up,

131
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One milligram point one oh point one or something like that point times

132
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.200
ethant: It's all little questionable because that stuff is made in China. And so like

133
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.650
ethant: You know, some Chinese lab.

134
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.700
ethant: Some Gino Chinese underground lab going to make doing their best estimate at the

135
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: At the figure it out. Yeah, there's

136
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:12.750
ethant: Supposed to kind of be to two milligrams, which there's a there's an equivalent equivalency calculator.

137
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.500
ethant: Which comes out to more than one

138
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.450
ethant: More than one

139
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:27.210
ethant: Day, for sure. So I'll, I'll start with one day of the ones that Mary gave me. And if I feel like I'm

140
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:33.840
ethant: Having significant panic problems and maybe I'll try one and a half for a day or two and then get back to one.

141
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.750
ethant: And ultimately until none.

142
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.270
ethant: Or, you know, unless I have an extreme panic situation that was the

143
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:51.390
ethant: Well panic situation or really bad headache. Those things are a lifesaver for for for migraines.

144
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes a difference.

145
00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.880
ethant: Yeah, I mean, it makes it, it works in cases where it's like, I take

146
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.960
ethant: So I have this

147
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.470
ethant: sumatriptan which is specifically for headaches.

148
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.530
ethant: And some sort of

149
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:32.760
ethant: Average headaches. I'll take one of those. And I'll just be fine. But that sometimes the headaches are so severe, I can take two of those. And it's still like indeed debilitating me until I take a quantum and then it suddenly like whatever it is that this dress part of it.

150
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:38.370
ethant: That it's causing the headache, you know, gets kind of addressed, and then it goes away.

151
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Haha, and have you seen a doctor for him.

152
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.900
ethant: Yeah.

153
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:54.570
ethant: When I showed up at bright hearts door that was, that was one of the prescriptions that I had was, was

154
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.950
ethant: That's why I had the Klonopin prescription was

155
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.800
ethant: Mean it was written for

156
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.760
ethant: For anxiety or panic.

157
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.130
ethant: But the reason that my primary care originally gave it to me was

158
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:27.780
ethant: That's not quite right. He originally originally gave it to me for panic because I guess he just got tired of me coming in there and having all these weird problems which just turned out to be things in my head. And he's like, obviously, you're just having panic attacks.

159
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.130
ethant: And so he gave he gave some to me to try when

160
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.580
ethant: When I was having one of those and. Yeah, no worries work like a charm and then

161
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.230
ethant: And then knowing that panic and

162
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.140
ethant: Anxiety in general and

163
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.460
ethant: And bet and

164
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.820
ethant: Migraines are connected. I started doing some research about it and

165
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.280
ethant: I discovered there are

166
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:05.790
ethant: Some doctors and it's not a first line of defense but there are some doctors that treat

167
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.840
ethant: Migraines with Klonopin

168
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:20.040
ethant: Me because it has all these drawbacks where you you know you you you get used to it. And then when you stop taking it that the headaches, come back, and then

169
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:31.290
ethant: You know, if you don't have anxiety problems, then it makes you a little dopey and all this. So that's why they don't try you know and it has addictive properties and blah, blah, blah.

170
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.070
Yeah.

171
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.430
ethant: But if

172
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.190
ethant: For certain patients with with bad migraines.

173
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:52.380
ethant: It's it's apparently well documented in the research literature that it works really works. And in my experience, it works really well. It's kind of amazing.

174
00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:05.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, be careful, you know, definitely you can become addicted to it physically addicted to it for sure. And that's a long drawn out detox, for sure.

175
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, I hope that

176
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: After this week that you take the time to

177
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To sleep. This weekend reflect this weekend and, you know, kind of get back on track, you know. Yeah.

178
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.590
ethant: That's my active plan.

179
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.330
Is to

180
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.320
ethant: pick back up with all this stuff that I was doing

181
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.910
Um,

182
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.570
ethant: And specifically, with the goal of like showing up for bright heart on Monday.

183
00:18:44.640 --> 00:19:02.580
ethant: And, you know, having. It's not that I just wanting to satisfy bright heart is the kind of thing that's going to keep me sober, but it, it was so great. Those like it was it just a month or a month and a half, whatever it was, but just sticking to those simple rules and

184
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.030
ethant: I you know I had no temptations.

185
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:23.430
ethant: Mean reading back through my journal. It was like it was still chaos every day. So it wasn't like I was, you know, just totally comfortable and everything was great, but at least the the the active damage being made by

186
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: addictive behavior was was basically cut to zero. Right. And that's a piece of it, you know.

187
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely it's crazy if you think about it, though. You know, you get in this rhythm of things in this routine and if things are working and

188
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing can happen.

189
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right to put you in this whole spiral, you know,

190
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:52.770
Yep.

191
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

192
00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:01.230
ethant: What the main thing I was already under the, the, all the insanity at work that was already happening, but

193
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:14.520
ethant: And I kind of got this sense from our, our lat, not the most recent group, but the group before that were like everybody was just like crazy because we can't go outside, we can you know

194
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:24.540
ethant: Yeah, so it was the I was just teetering on the edge already with all with with my work situation and then that

195
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.310
You know,

196
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.940
ethant: The Apocalypse or whatever's going on and outside

197
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.460
ethant: And push me over to the edge or I'm like okay I can, I can. This is a

198
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.450
ethant: You know, it's never a reasonable thinking in hindsight that at the time. It felt like, yep. This is

199
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.330
This is a

200
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.690
ethant: This is solid thinking

201
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why you always want to have a sober support. So you could bounce it off, you know, these ideas that do take you back to

202
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The destruction. You know what I mean. And they can kind of bring you back around to the right way to think about things, you know,

203
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:22.170
ethant: Yeah, I did. I reached out to Dan about that was like dude, we need both of us need to have good super good you know support or during these crazy time so we should set up a regular Skype.

204
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:34.320
ethant: And he responded back. He's like, that's a great idea, let's you know let's start tonight. And then I just fell off on and didn't take him back. But that's a good reminder. That'll be something I'll do tonight.

205
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.170
ethant: I already have, like, eight things back to that I have to do for work and that I can do that for myself.

206
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just take a few minutes to focus you know on you.

207
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and it's the first step of getting right back on track.

208
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yes.

209
00:21:54.570 --> 00:22:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you make the choice to to quit, you know, make sure that you don't have any in your house, you know, get them out of your house.

210
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:17.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you know one as you seen taking one finding one taking one automatic remember yeah you know that really opens the doorway for that total spiral and

211
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:26.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you want to make sure that make sure that you're secure that your environment, secure, you know, and stay connected

212
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and you think about back at, you know, a month ago life still happens. This is a piece of it. You know what I mean, life still happens, it's still stressful. We still have all of these things that we have to deal with. We've just got to learn how to deal with them without

213
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Substances

214
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And in the very beginning, it can be overwhelming. It can be tough, you know,

215
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this is the piece where you know where we say we are powerless.

216
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because we are powerless over our addiction and we're certainly not powerless over choices.

217
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:15.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and we're certainly not not powerless powerless over getting up and starting fresh again. Every day is a new opportunity to do something different, you know,

218
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So on Monday. I'm hoping to

219
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To hear that you know you did, you know, do as you plan to

220
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.780
ethant: Fall, for sure. Yeah.

221
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, and that you're, you know, making healthier choices.

222
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm not going to give you a

223
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do I say it.

224
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you, if

225
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.640
An assignment.

226
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you have plenty. Obviously, you got to get back on track. Now, so you've got to get you know regenerate everything that you've heard already going, you've got plenty

227
00:23:52.530 --> 00:24:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what I was going to say is if if you were struggling on Monday, and you still you know aren't able to stop. I mean, I'm not going to kick you out of group. I'm not going to

228
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, stop therapy. I want to walk you through this and get you to the other side. You know, so I you know I just want you to know that and be be secure in that piece. Cool. I appreciate that. Yeah.

229
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:23.880
ethant: This is like it's the self care. Well, just basic self care is that you don't you don't stop.

230
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.280
ethant: Trying to go to your self care resources when you need it the most.

231
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:36.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, you know, our way of thinking, you know, the addicted brain it's like that's the hardest thing to do.

232
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing. Like we we start doing these things that are healthy for us and we're feeling good. And then we have a trigger. And then we have a craving and event trigger craving, you know, and then we use

233
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we go down this whole spiraling whole and we know still what's good for us.

234
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, we find every reason in the world to keep doing what we're doing. Instead of getting right back on track. It's kind of and that's part of the addicted brain, you know,

235
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:16.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you get to a point where you have a couple days of clarity, a couple days of clearness

236
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and then we can kind of work on that. Stop.

237
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know in your head, stop. And, you know, turn the other direction.

238
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're addicted brain starts talking to you and telling you what a good idea. This is, you know,

239
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It sounds like a plan.

240
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:46.050
ethant: Yeah, so, um, I need to talk to you about it. The, the film's I'm just about to run out of films.

241
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many of you got

242
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.020
One.

243
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's weird.

244
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What, how did that happen.

245
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.110
ethant: Well, you asked me a group, how many I had and I had three

246
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Three days. Okay, right. Yep.

247
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Alright, let me do this really fast and I'll

248
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Daniel sleeping.

249
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mary

250
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Also there's another piece of this that I want.

251
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:36.660
To

252
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on.

253
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To

254
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:48.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I want you to be aware of. And that is, you know, when somebody relapses

255
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: While they're in treatment. The idea is to get a closer

256
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To keep keep close tabs on them.

257
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just know that that is a possibility that Mary has if she you and her talk and she you know finds out that you're continually using she might lower your

258
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your refills to like three days every three days, you have to do a check in and tell you're back on track. And then she gets expanded out or

259
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and that's just to kind of walk alongside yet through this whole process and make sure that you're okay. And yeah, so you know it makes sense.

260
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that piece to that I wanted to let you know about, but I just sent a message. I'm going to email her to marry and let her know that you need a refill. Cool. Alright, so that way. I've covered both

261
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Through through my virtual clinic and

262
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Female

263
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.560
ethant: Sorry.

264
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.420
ethant: I said sorry you covered both

265
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you checked your pharmacy.

266
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

267
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.730
ethant: usually get a notification from them, but I'll check with them.

268
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright.

269
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so

270
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just sent her

271
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just sent her a email and I sent her and Danielle both a message on Slack so

272
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um,

273
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because Danielle is the one that just kind of works with the doctors and making sure that people get their medication. So

274
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.440
ethant: All the crazy restrictions with insurance and everything.

275
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so that's underway now I just initiated that for you.

276
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your plan the next couple days is to continue on this path until Friday and then

277
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:54.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You plan on resting for the weekend and starting back on your other routine Monday. Okay.

278
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, and you're going to call your support system tonight. Yep.

279
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.480
Okay.

280
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

281
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.530
ethant: Yeah.

282
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.510
ethant: I got a call my mom to and so I'm a little trip trip for this about

283
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.610
ethant: Because she

284
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.060
ethant: I have an eye out now told her, like, you know, basically relapse, but

285
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.400
ethant: But I gotta tell her at some point.

286
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

287
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What do you think she'll say,

288
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.310
ethant: She'll be disappointed, but I

289
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.230
ethant: Know, she might

290
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.730
ethant: scold me a little bit, but I think she's mainly gonna tell me to just get back on track.

291
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, she wants to see you succeed. Yeah, yeah.

292
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good that she support for you to, you know, yeah.

293
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.090
ethant: Yeah, yeah. I have a lot of good family support. So I'm lucky in that area.

294
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:14.940
ethant: Good. Well, it's funny. It kind of goes both ways. It's like when when I'm not doing well and then I don't want to talk to the family because I'm I don't want the schooling or whatever.

295
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.260
He then

296
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.170
ethant: And then immediately becomes this sort of

297
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.290
ethant: Trying to walk in log into Walgreens here.

298
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.480
Password.

299
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.910
Ready for pick

300
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.850
ethant: Maybe already do have some quantity 30 ready for pickup.

301
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.760
ethant: It does come in.

302
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.980
ethant: Wasn't expecting

303
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.450
ethant: Thank you for telling me to do that here. I'll paste it.

304
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.640
ethant: On if I can show you this.

305
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah, you've got it.

306
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:55.470
ethant: Yeah, and they're even open till nine so I can hit it. Well, I guess it's not an emergency, I can do this tomorrow. We have plenty of things to do tonight.

307
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Perfect. Okay. All right, let me

308
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell them to so

309
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ya know, they don't think

310
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They don't think anything

311
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yep.

312
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:20.610
ethant: My apologies. Yeah, I'm a decent that I asked you and you sent that message to marry and I have to send another one thing, nevermind. He already sent it.

313
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Got it. Not a big deal.

314
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either I'm here.

315
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My screen is just doing weird stuff today.

316
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, cuz I've still got

317
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're still sharing your screen.

318
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

319
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.880
Sure.

320
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.320
I think it's

321
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.610
ethant: So you can't see my face. I can see my face.

322
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:35.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can see your face, but I have zoom and then right behind that I have your screen is still up and it's actually sitting on your calendar.

323
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:39.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It says Joel's slash david be

324
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:42.510
ethant: Yeah, so

325
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Crazy.

326
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it won't let me click out of it. It won't nothing

327
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.400
ethant: sickies. We're

328
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.200
ethant: Here, I get this, I can share you my whole desktop, but I don't think that's what

329
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We want to closed.

330
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it doesn't give me the option option to do anything.

331
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you're sharing it. So for some reason. It's kind of stuck on that.

332
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.790
ethant: They ever tell you my reason that I'm frustrated, a little bit with zoom

333
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What

334
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:31.410
ethant: So we had a CEO and then Kelly stack Berg at my company for like five years. She was great. She

335
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.170
ethant: She kind of it.

336
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.180
ethant: So click click stop here.

337
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.130
That helps hope.

338
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is still there.

339
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.640
ethant: Anyway, when we disconnect it will fix it. So Kelly.

340
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.770
The

341
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:07.770
ethant: I DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL WORD OF THIS. But the word on the street was that she had an affair with with somebody who worked at the company and the board found out about it and the board thought it was a really big deal.

342
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.340
ethant: bigger deal than anyone else.

343
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.610
ethant: Interpreted as

344
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.830
ethant: So they fired her.

345
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:25.170
ethant: And it was a big problem for us because we needed a CEO. She was a great CEO and we needed a new one. And it started this sort of

346
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.440
ethant: That was the beginning of of not so great, period.

347
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:39.240
ethant: But anyway, what she did when she got fired. When she left and became the CTO of Zoosk and like nine months after she left CT Zoosk went public.

348
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.410
ethant: And you can even

349
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:46.890
ethant: You can even tell in the in the in the filings for the IPO that

350
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:49.920
ethant: Kelly made

351
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.450
ethant: Like $9 million cash as part of the

352
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.260
ethant: As far as the the

353
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.880
ethant: The, you know, the offering of the company on the stock market.

354
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now that

355
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.070
ethant: I haven't followed like the stock price. Ever since then but

356
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:13.050
ethant: So it's like the ones didn't unhappy for around the other seven, something like

357
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:31.200
ethant: Geez, like as a resident trying to get my company to including Kelly even trying, trying to get things to work for so long and then ended up in this kind of iffy merger deal that no one's really making a ton of money on, sir.

358
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.360
ethant: But Kelly left and got to make millions so good for her.

359
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.830
Wow.

360
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: crazy stuff. Yep.

361
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, well I'm gonna let you out of here so you can get to work and call your sober support.

362
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, and I will be looking forward to seeing you in group on Monday, no matter what. Make sure that you show up no matter what. All right.

363
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, don't miss it because if you know

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

365
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:19.770
ethant: Yeah. And hey, I don't know, maybe this doesn't matter at all. The reason that I missed group last week was I was asleep. It was one of those that just one of those cases where I like Crash after being up too long and like, by the time I came to. It was like two hours past group diamond.

366
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.660
ethant: So it wasn't like I was awake and like you know

367
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.560
ethant: The deciding to not participate

368
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm sure, with the schedule. You've been keeping you know definitely makes perfect sense that you actually take cat naps where you good

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

370
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.030
ethant: It's not an excuse or and I'm just

371
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:48.030
ethant: Just so you know, it wasn't like, I'm just gonna blow off Rebecca today that's it wasn't my plan at all.

372
00:38:48.540 --> 00:39:03.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you're pretty consistent. And on top of things. So generally, so you know, I, I get that. And I know that so I'm not worried you're forgiven. Definitely.
