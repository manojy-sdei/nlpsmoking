113
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.760

114
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.460

Hannah Gunter: I see her tomorrow. Well, I have group tomorrow. I don't have a one on one with her. I just have group tomorrow.

157
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.670
Hannah Gunter: But I mean, I'll talk with the ring group or whatnot.

158
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.320
Richelle Direny: And I remember the last time we talked you talked about

159
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:54.570
Richelle Direny: Austin time experiencing blackouts on the last time that we met was back in November. November 21 right before the Thanksgiving holidays.

160
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.290
Richelle Direny: Have you

161
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.280
Richelle Direny: Had any of those backgrounds or anything like that.

162
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.680
Hannah Gunter: No, I have it. I've actually been, I've been doing a lot better with it.

163
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.590
Richelle Direny: Now,

164
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:17.460
Richelle Direny: I know you said, a lot of it was surrounding like if you ever got into an argument with your spouse or any kind of long situation.

165
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.580
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, I like I said, we've been doing a lot better. Just take it one day at a time, you know,

166
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:32.610
Hannah Gunter: I try not to rush anything because doing that, you know, things kind of get out of whack. So I guess. Patience is a virtue.

167
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.080
Richelle Direny: And we know with your grandmother when she on hospice prior to her financing or was it kind of

168
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.880
Hannah Gunter: Well, hospice came in, I believe the day before she passed away.

169
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.160
Hannah Gunter: And

170
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.900
Richelle Direny: So as soon as they started Steve should pass the lead within a day of them starting. Yeah.

171
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:53.730
Yeah.

172
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.940
Hannah Gunter: My mom didn't even call me and let me know, because I was supposed to go down and

173
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.710
Hannah Gunter: I wait for

174
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.300
Richelle Direny: her because she didn't tell you know

175
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:17.460
Hannah Gunter: She didn't she told me everything was fine with my girl, because I had went and seen her the night. Prior to her passing away, and I told them. I told her I would be back to see her.

176
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.090
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, I just don't want to talk about that right now.

177
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.670
Hannah Gunter: I'm just not ready to

178
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.650
Richelle Direny: A little Brief Therapy. But like you said, a little fresh

179
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.600
Hannah Gunter: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

180
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.690
Richelle Direny: See now all the sudden you became loud.

181
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.100
Hannah Gunter: Okay. Yep. You did.

182
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.170
Hannah Gunter: But I guess I really haven't dealt with it. And I just, I'm not ready to

183
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:14.460
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it takes a little time. It takes a little time and so I mean only been you said the 2016

184
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.790
Hannah Gunter: No, no, the 24th. She passed away on Christmas Eve.

185
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.260
Richelle Direny: Christmas Eve. Okay, little, a little over a month.

186
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.060
Hannah Gunter: Okay about yeah around a month. Yeah, but

187
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:35.700
Richelle Direny: Then it doesn't help with what's going on in the news. Now, this is like a reminder of

188
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.550
You know people that we've lost

189
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.740
Hannah Gunter: Yeah.

190
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.080
Hannah Gunter: You know, the only two people I ever had, you know,

191
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.010
Richelle Direny: It was your sister. Very around afterwards.

192
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.140
Hannah Gunter: I know your sister.

193
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.700
Richelle Direny: Was a relationship.

194
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.580
Hannah Gunter: Oh yeah, my sister, my grandma was in the nursing home where my sister.

195
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.800
Hannah Gunter: She works.

196
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.580
Hannah Gunter: So my sister was with her, you know,

197
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:19.980
Richelle Direny: Okay. Oh, so she was there helping your remedy. You're saying, Yeah, okay. But then I was asking, how was it for you like

198
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.760
Richelle Direny: Because you guys have had the funeral sense right

199
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.560
Hannah Gunter: Excuse me.

200
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.430
Richelle Direny: You had the funeral. So your sister was there.

201
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.580
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, yeah. My whole family was there.

202
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.340
Hannah Gunter: No one even really acknowledge

203
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.200
Hannah Gunter: Was there. Yeah.

204
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.770
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, I'm just not ready to

205
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:52.800
Hannah Gunter: Think about it.

206
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.990
Richelle Direny: Hi helps with the healing.

207
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.190
Process.

208
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.070
Hannah Gunter: I don't know.

209
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.740
Hannah Gunter: Because. Trust me, I've done my fair share of probably not healed yet so

210
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:07.920
Richelle Direny: What's it

211
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.760
Hannah Gunter: Statistics say that I've noticed, this is a statistic at all. So,

212
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:25.410
Richelle Direny: Um, yeah, kind of the healing process. You get out. It gets it out all of those body locomotion. It helps to release it.

213
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:26.760
Richelle Direny: Oh,

214
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.360
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, that's what I do I push you to like push everything down.

215
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.140
Hannah Gunter: Sit down and just keep pushing them best.

216
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:42.330
Richelle Direny: Thanks. So crying helps to release the pain, what you're feeling the emotion, like you said, even though you know

217
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.230
Hannah Gunter: I feel weak.

218
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.680
Richelle Direny: I completely get it.

219
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.470
Hannah Gunter: I completely get it but

220
00:17:51.420 --> 00:18:01.500
Richelle Direny: In this situation, it is definitely something that helps with the process because like you said you know that she's in a better place. Oh, it's okay to cry.

221
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.830
Richelle Direny: It's okay. And you say you have your biggest supporter there with you, your husband. I do.

222
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:15.300
Richelle Direny: Yes. Yeah, but I really encourage just to continue, um,

223
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.120
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, if I didn't have him well.

224
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.650
Richelle Direny: Huh.

225
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.860
Hannah Gunter: If I didn't have. I don't know what what happened.

226
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.150
Hannah Gunter: I don't know. Well, it would be bad.

227
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.890
Yeah.

228
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.480
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of like I know like we talked about just the dress like so social

229
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.160
Richelle Direny: Anxiety and even though

230
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.550
Richelle Direny: You've been going to the meetings with your host name and you have your sponsor.

231
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.470
Richelle Direny: About like the socialization. I know that was another thing that we

232
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.150
Hannah Gunter: Want on your socialization.

233
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.180
Hannah Gunter: Well, like I said, I'm still kinda working my way into

234
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.590
Richelle Direny: Away, you went away.

235
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.560
Hannah Gunter: Oh, can you hear me now.

236
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.760
Richelle Direny: I can hear you. It's just that you just sound very fun.

237
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.280
Hannah Gunter: I don't know what is wrong.

238
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.980
Hannah Gunter: Okay, now. Now, what was it again. I'm sorry.

239
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.640
Richelle Direny: No, I was talking about your socialization. How has that been for

240
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:20.880
Hannah Gunter: You

241
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.940
Richelle Direny: Being able to socialize on your own initiating

242
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:33.090
Hannah Gunter: conversations with people yeah i i i don't talk to people. I don't do well with people. People there too judgmental.

243
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.730
Hannah Gunter: And that is one thing I do not

244
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.370
Hannah Gunter: I do not go for

245
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.030
Hannah Gunter: That's I think that's a reason. Another reason you know that I do have social anxiety.

246
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.860
Hannah Gunter: There's too many judgmental people

247
00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.390
Hannah Gunter: In this world and I judge myself enough, let alone, someone else, you know,

248
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.390
Richelle Direny: What do you find initially when you meet someone, you can look at them through that lens before even having a conversation with them.

249
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.040
Hannah Gunter: No.

250
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.730
Hannah Gunter: No, that I feel that they do that to me.

251
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.730
Hannah Gunter: I feel that it's vice versa.

252
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:32.190
Hannah Gunter: In, you know, I just feel, you know, just because I am a drug addict. But I'm a recovering drug addict. That doesn't define me as a person at all.

253
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.540
Hannah Gunter: Well,

254
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.580
Richelle Direny: I think part of what we

255
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.930
Richelle Direny: Are ourselves, like you say we're we're our own worst critic.

256
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:40.950
Yeah.

257
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.240
Richelle Direny: Definitely our own worst critic, but at the same time.

258
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.610
Richelle Direny: The way we look at ourselves and what we think of ourselves.

259
00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.920
Richelle Direny: You automatically think the people

260
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.960
Richelle Direny: around you is the same thing.

261
00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:13.590
Richelle Direny: The way you look at self and then you know it doesn't necessarily help that you said you don't necessarily have the greatest relationship with the people who are deemed as meaningful in your life. And because of how they look at you, you kind of somewhat

262
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.730
Richelle Direny: I mean, and I've we've talked about in the past and

263
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:28.590
Richelle Direny: Without realizing it, we start thinking of ourselves and think others think of us the way people who are meaningful in our lives. Look at us and think of us.

264
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.260
Hannah Gunter: I mean, that's

265
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:32.970
Yeah.

266
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:41.340
Hannah Gunter: That's true. I mean, uh, but I just, I don't know, that's just, that's where I'm at right now, I guess.

267
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.810
Richelle Direny: Even you know we all do it it's it's not it we all

268
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:58.800
Richelle Direny: We all do it. If you think about when you were younger, I don't know if you've ever had. Have you ever had, as I'm talking about it. I think about, like, have you when you were younger, you've ever had, like, a pupil that cigarette on your face and you think

269
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.000
The world and

270
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:06.870
Richelle Direny: Attention to

271
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.830
Richelle Direny: What we do, we're like,

272
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.920
Richelle Direny: The person is talking to us. And I'm like, I'm looking at this

273
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:17.940
Is

274
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.440
Richelle Direny: Why, why they don't stop looking at it. You're the only one that knows that.

275
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.300
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, that's worrying about it and I. That's what I don't know how to overcome. I don't know how to overcome that.

276
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.100
Hannah Gunter: But it's

277
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.150
Richelle Direny: All of us it's

278
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.260
Every single

279
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.120
Hannah Gunter: aspect to it.

280
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.170
Richelle Direny: Why do I give the example of does it because I've walked that road, I

281
00:22:42.990 --> 00:23:00.330
Richelle Direny: Want that point. But I think it's, it's our own self confidence and self esteem that needs to come up right now for you. It's really super low. So it's just your own self confidence, it's your own self esteem. It's like super low so you

282
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.780
Hannah Gunter: Just

283
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:08.730
Richelle Direny: Say that, you know, I don't know. That's what you want, that's what you have to work on. It's your. How do you pick yourself.

284
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.090
Hannah Gunter: And say that like that's hard.

285
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.330
Hannah Gunter: Because I don't look at myself.

286
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.680
Hannah Gunter: In a good manner and a good sort of perspective at all.

287
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.570
Richelle Direny: How would you describe. So how would you describe it and tell me about

288
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.560
Hannah Gunter: Oh gosh, I don't even know.

289
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.390
Hannah Gunter: That's a hard one.

290
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.510
Richelle Direny: But what do you think, and I think about

291
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.630
Richelle Direny: Or not what's in it. What does anything people think about her.

292
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.990
Hannah Gunter: I think that they

293
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.840
Hannah Gunter: See drug addict, you know,

294
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.460
Hannah Gunter: Worthless that I'll never amount to anything.

295
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.770
Hannah Gunter: And that's not true, because I am I am very, very smart.

296
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.390
Hannah Gunter: I

297
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.170
Hannah Gunter: I just you know i i think the worst.

298
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.950
Richelle Direny: What did you no something that you're saying, I've heard in the past. What is your think about you.

299
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.640
Hannah Gunter: Oh my, my sister and I don't get along at all.

300
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.410
Richelle Direny: I understand that, but what does she think if she was supposed to describe our what was

301
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.360
Hannah Gunter: What I just what I just said to you.

302
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.480
Richelle Direny: And you believe that because of what she says to you,

303
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.290
Hannah Gunter: And she's a judgmental bitch, that's why. Yes.

304
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:50.400
Richelle Direny: But remember, it's outside of the fact that she's judgmental. Remember, we believe, of ourselves is true what others say or think about us. And if a person says it long enough, we

305
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.380
Richelle Direny: We own it.

306
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.050
Hannah Gunter: Yes, we own it.

307
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.710
Richelle Direny: So,

308
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.090
Hannah Gunter: And the reason why I

309
00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:10.320
Richelle Direny: Said, What is your sister think about because it was very hard for me to tell me about no but no was able to tell me what someone's you're at what you're still thinks about for is what Anna thinks about yourself.

310
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.670
Okay.

311
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:18.180
Hannah Gunter: Do you mean Hannah, are you ME KNOW YOU'RE CALLING ME. Anna.

312
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.540
Hannah Gunter: I was confused.

313
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.690
Hannah Gunter: Yes.

314
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:31.890
Hannah Gunter: But yes, that is, that's why I do, that's a big part of my social anxiety. Most definitely.

315
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:45.420
Richelle Direny: Because we are convinced. Yes, the people who are meaningful in our lives family close friends ones, what they think about us.

316
00:25:45.930 --> 00:26:03.900
Richelle Direny: We have redefined who we are based on their lens. So it's very hard for you to tell me something. Otherwise, because you're fully convinced that you are worth nothing, you will never amount to anything because you're fully convinced that

317
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:21.870
Hannah Gunter: I'm i mean i'm i'm not convinced of that. I know that that's where I'm at, in life right now am I always going to feel that I am you know worthless a drug addict, you know. No, I'm not. Because it doesn't define me.

318
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.690
Richelle Direny: But it's very hard for you to

319
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.250
Richelle Direny: Me.

320
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.060
Hannah Gunter: And that's what I need help with. Yes.

321
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.490
Richelle Direny: Well, the first question to start please does analysts, Anna.

322
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.570
Hannah Gunter: Yes, I do love myself.

323
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.570
Richelle Direny: And does does Hannah believe that she's worth something.

324
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.910
Hannah Gunter: I do

325
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.240
Hannah Gunter: I just lost sight of it, I guess.

326
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.790
Richelle Direny: It's not, I guess.

327
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:55.740
Hannah Gunter: Yes.

328
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.530
Richelle Direny: Understand, it's looking

329
00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.010
Hannah Gunter: At it.

330
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.350
Richelle Direny: It's starting off with

331
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:11.340
Richelle Direny: It's nice when your husband and tell you the positive and the great things. It's nice when some people tell you the positive and the great things.

332
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.150
Hannah Gunter: But you

333
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:17.250
Richelle Direny: Have to tell you the positive in the great things about yourself.

334
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.330
Richelle Direny: Then

335
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:29.460
Richelle Direny: And working on building that self confidence is telling yourself. It doesn't matter what another person think or feel because everyone is entitled to their own opinion that they can

336
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:41.100
Hannah Gunter: You're right. Yeah. And it doesn't matter what they think it's just at that point in time, at that moment, you know, I know how people are and

337
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:50.220
Hannah Gunter: It's, it's really not me bashing myself as much as I know it is other people. Mm hmm.

338
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.070
Richelle Direny: Exactly.

339
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.150
Hannah Gunter: Well, it's

340
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.000
Hannah Gunter: Like I don't know where to start.

341
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.910
Richelle Direny: You start with you.

342
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:06.210
Hannah Gunter: Yeah.

343
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.020
Hannah Gunter: I do

344
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:16.950
Richelle Direny: It starts with you there. I think was the one I sing the song, I think, was Michael Jackson.

345
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:28.860
Richelle Direny: Uh huh. What is the song I'm starting with the men in the mirror. Yep, I'm asking him, it was a change his ways and in the day. The Man in the Mirror is who

346
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.520
Hannah Gunter: Make yourself that's

347
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:43.740
Richelle Direny: That's all that's who. That's, that's all that's important. It's all about what you think about you. I'm not saying to be conceited, and I'm not saying to be overly self, it's just

348
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.960
Richelle Direny: And that's how you start. It's not allowing

349
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:55.290
Richelle Direny: It's thinking how much power and control. Have you allow people to have over you.

350
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:57.750
Hannah Gunter: And the word

351
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.010
Richelle Direny: How much power and control. Have you allowed people to have over you.

352
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:18.000
Hannah Gunter: Well, I guess not full control because I can still, you know, I still know you know what I know is what's right, you know, and what you know what is so

353
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.210
It's just

354
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:33.570
Hannah Gunter: It's just there are so many people whom are judgmental and they judge before you know they know someone

355
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.100
Hannah Gunter: And that's not the type of person I am.

356
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.960
Hannah Gunter: Okay, so

357
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.900
Richelle Direny: Everyone is judgmental in some way. Okay.

358
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.920
Richelle Direny: So we're going to start every single person.

359
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.900
Hannah Gunter: Instrumental in some way.

360
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.800
Hannah Gunter: Whether you

361
00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:04.110
Richelle Direny: Realize it or not. Every single person is judgmental. I'm judgmental or just mentioned your husband. Your mom, your brother, your every person is judged.

362
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.470
Hannah Gunter: Right.

363
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.430
Hannah Gunter: All right. It just depends on what level they take it to

364
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.960
Exactly.

365
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:24.330
Richelle Direny: You taking it to the point where you are going to damage a person's way of looking at their self confidence their self image. Are you going to, and oftentimes we do that simply

366
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:24.990
Because

367
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.490
That's always

368
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.980
Richelle Direny: That's all you know a lot of

369
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:35.280
Richelle Direny: Us know but we often think about a bully is a bully is a bully because a bully is what

370
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:37.680
Richelle Direny: Bullied first

371
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.850
Hannah Gunter: Well, like first. Yes.

372
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.950
Hannah Gunter: That's all they know

373
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.270
Richelle Direny: That's all they know

374
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.510
Richelle Direny: Is a bully, simply because they're bullied first

375
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.170
Hannah Gunter: Yes.

376
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:56.340
Richelle Direny: But then it changes their perspective on how they do things like you hurt. I want you, I hurt. I want you to hurt because I need you, the same way.

377
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:11.610
Hannah Gunter: But see, that I don't feel that way, though. Michelle I don't feel that, you know, if I'm sad or upset that I want you know my loved one to fail that or even worse, that's what

378
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.450
Hannah Gunter: I'm struggling with. I'm not like that.

379
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:22.170
Richelle Direny: The end. You're right. You don't want to do it, but other people are like that. I'm hurt. So guess what I'm gonna tell you

380
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.850
Hannah Gunter: Everything bad about yourself. Yes.

381
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:28.290
Richelle Direny: Because I need you to feel the way I feel I'm feeling crappy, I need you to feel crappy right along.

382
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:28.530
Hannah Gunter: Yeah.

383
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.520
Richelle Direny: But the difference is you start believing the crap, I'm telling you.

384
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.170
Yeah.

385
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.080
Richelle Direny: So now you just gave me power over you.

386
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.340
Richelle Direny: Because I am I'm feeling bad. So I'm going to make you feel bad.

387
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:57.420
Richelle Direny: Now notice that you're eating up the stuff. So now I just became your personalized boom because you gave me power to do so.

388
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:59.940
Hannah Gunter: OK, I see.

389
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.680
Hannah Gunter: I do I understand it's a

390
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.820
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

391
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:13.530
Hannah Gunter: It's just hard. Like, I don't know, it's, it's hard. I don't know where to start, or even you know how to

392
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.600
Hannah Gunter: If I could change the world and you know make everyone like me, I would do it.

393
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:34.980
Richelle Direny: We can't unfortunately we all feel that way, but we can't. But what we could do it. We could just start with loving ourselves and trying our best not to

394
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.240
Richelle Direny: Give people control.

395
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:48.870
Hannah Gunter: Right, and I do, I do love myself. I, I do. It's just, I've lost sight of how much I love myself.

396
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:55.200
Richelle Direny: Mm Hmm, how can how can you what is one thing that you can work on

397
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:57.930
Hannah Gunter: Oh well.

398
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.770
Hannah Gunter: That's there's a lot. I could, I need to work on.

399
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.770
Richelle Direny: It's a lot. We all need to work on a lot of things, but

400
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:05.730
Hannah Gunter: You know,

401
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:12.180
Hannah Gunter: Finding you know myself that that part of that love that I've, you know,

402
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.020
Richelle Direny: And where did you lose yourself. At what point in life. Did you lose yourself.

403
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.200
Hannah Gunter: A long time ago.

404
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.470
Richelle Direny: That's where you start. And when was that

405
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.180
Hannah Gunter: Well, it's been about 18 years. That's where you start.

406
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.890
Richelle Direny: You got to find that little person. Yeah. And what be yourself.

407
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.340
Richelle Direny: And I know a lot of that surrounds the abuse you sustained with through that right

408
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.180
Yeah.

409
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.010
Hannah Gunter: Yeah.

410
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.850
Richelle Direny: That's what started the addiction.

411
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.040
Richelle Direny: Yep. Now,

412
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.780
Hannah Gunter: Yes, you're right.

413
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.080
Hannah Gunter: I did it to you know numb myself and

414
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.660
Hannah Gunter: Maybe get attention.

415
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.610
Hannah Gunter: Because I didn't have it from my mom or, you know,

416
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.120
So,

417
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.050
Richelle Direny: We can be fun. I remember in our session. He talks about. You are the only one that experienced it right

418
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:16.920
Yeah.

419
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:18.720
Hannah Gunter: Yep.

420
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.870
Hannah Gunter: But I have broad shoulders.

421
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.930
Hannah Gunter: To have to

422
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.010
Richelle Direny: When did you start developing broad shoulders.

423
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.110
Hannah Gunter: Whoo.

424
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.540
Hannah Gunter: Probably when I was a kid.

425
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.240
Richelle Direny: And what made you. What did you tell yourself to start in the valley developing

426
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.420
Hannah Gunter: I didn't I, I had no choice.

427
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:52.200
Richelle Direny: No, I know. But I had what was going on in your mind at the time that you can remember that helped you to develop those broad shoulders.

428
00:34:53.580 --> 00:35:03.960
Hannah Gunter: It wasn't anything good that helped me, you know, be able to take on what I take on trust me it wasn't it, it wasn't something good. It wasn't a good outcome.

429
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:13.260
Hannah Gunter: But I just I you know I grew up and I dealt with it.

430
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.330
Hannah Gunter: The way I dealt with it.

431
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.250
Richelle Direny: And how did you you dealt with it, like you said, in a not so good way. Right.

432
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:27.240
Hannah Gunter: Right, I won't. I wouldn't say a wrong way. But I will, you know, not, not very good.

433
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:33.360
Richelle Direny: But what was but describe what is you're not very good. Because if you're everything you can you can

434
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.430
Hannah Gunter: Turn drugs, drugs.

435
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.360
Richelle Direny: Drugs to help you to get through.

436
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.760
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay.

437
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:51.240
Richelle Direny: Now you you let it was a bad thing that you were going through. It was a horrible thing that you went through, but

438
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.100
Richelle Direny: Gave you

439
00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:05.850
Richelle Direny: Some options. The one option that seemed effective in your mind at that time was being introduced to drugs, where it helps nothing

440
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:14.610
Hannah Gunter: Yeah. And I, and I was, I think, also, like I said, I was crying out for attention that I was not getting

441
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.920
Hannah Gunter: The only, you know, good attention and the only people who loved me. You know where my grandma and grandpa.

442
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.680
Hannah Gunter: And they're gone.

443
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:40.410
Richelle Direny: They're gone. But at that time, because remember you saying you're trying to find yourself you lost it about 18 years ago. Yeah, and your grandma and grandpa are worth their in addition to them you sought out other things.

444
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:49.860
Richelle Direny: Yes, he's to help with the situation, but with your grandparents. How did they provide that direction that you sought out

445
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.580
Hannah Gunter: Um, they, they

446
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.040
Hannah Gunter: They gave me the love.

447
00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.830
Hannah Gunter: That my mom.

448
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.470
Hannah Gunter: never even tried

449
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.080
Hannah Gunter: To give me

450
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:12.090
Richelle Direny: And how did your grandmother and grandfather do that like this. How did they do that. In what way that you felt

451
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:18.570
Hannah Gunter: That love it. They traded that I was I was their kid, you know, I was theirs.

452
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:27.870
Richelle Direny: But there you are. So you had some one you felt that sense of belonging.

453
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.910
Hannah Gunter: Of course,

454
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:42.660
Richelle Direny: And what else you identified that in your that time in your life when you sort something out. You were seeking out and that they met you. What they met you.

455
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.110
Richelle Direny: What you needed it was

456
00:37:46.470 --> 00:38:00.270
Hannah Gunter: It's, it's hard because from the time I was born until now, you know, my grandma, grandpa raised me so I mean honestly, I couldn't tell you I don't

457
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:02.520
Hannah Gunter: Know,

458
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:14.340
Richelle Direny: I'm like my ratio and they provided that they were kind of they bridge that gap for you to some degree. Was there a part of you that still sought it out from your mom.

459
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.990
Hannah Gunter: Yes, and I still do.

460
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.280
Richelle Direny: There you go.

461
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.560
Hannah Gunter: I still do today, you know,

462
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.030
Hannah Gunter: I

463
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.940
Hannah Gunter: I hold on and I hope you know

464
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.950
Richelle Direny: And what's what's causing that division, because as much as your grandparents.

465
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:35.220
Richelle Direny: gave you that temporary respite in terms of they provided that love and affection.

466
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.670
Richelle Direny: About what is blocking it today.

467
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.380
Hannah Gunter: I don't know. I don't know. So

468
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.600
Richelle Direny: You don't have to, you have a relationship with your mom at all.

469
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.430
Hannah Gunter: I try to

470
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.830
Richelle Direny: And what's stopping it.

471
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:54.750
Hannah Gunter: Her

472
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.820
Richelle Direny: Based on your understanding, what do you think what

473
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.480
Hannah Gunter: I know it's

474
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.910
Hannah Gunter: It's her look. It's not me, it's her

475
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:08.280
Richelle Direny: But I'm saying from from your, what you can see from your field of view.

476
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.770
Richelle Direny: What do you think for her is hindering her

477
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.490
Oh,

478
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.340
Hannah Gunter: I believe what happened to me as a child, and she blames herself.

479
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.990
Richelle Direny: She blamed herself for it.

480
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:25.980
Hannah Gunter: Yes.

481
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:33.210
Richelle Direny: Did she can. So she can't bring herself to embrace you in, whether it's saying

482
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.780
Hannah Gunter: It. I feel like she she

483
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.090
Hannah Gunter: She hates me.

484
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.200
Richelle Direny: She hates you. For in Europe in Europe based on what you think she hates you, for

485
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:51.660
Hannah Gunter: For what happened to me as a child like she blames me

486
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.450
Richelle Direny: She blames you

487
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.500
Hannah Gunter: In the sense

488
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.450
Richelle Direny: That she think it's your fault.

489
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.830
Hannah Gunter: Yes, yes.

490
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.170
Richelle Direny: Is it that she felt that your dad was giving you

491
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.400
Richelle Direny: The love and affection that she desired

492
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.380
Hannah Gunter: Yes. Yep.

493
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:18.240
Richelle Direny: And to this day, she does she think that your dad loves you more than her.

494
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.890
Hannah Gunter: I think so, yes.

495
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:25.740
Richelle Direny: And so it no point in time that she ever think that that was not love.

496
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.540
Hannah Gunter: Right.

497
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.610
Hannah Gunter: She believes in her. I don't know. She's just

498
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:42.870
Hannah Gunter: She does it. I mean, I don't say it at all. She I I try and call her. I tried reach out to her every way possible.

499
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:44.850
Hannah Gunter: And

500
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.840
Richelle Direny: The feelings are not reciprocated. Right.

501
00:40:53.130 --> 00:41:00.720
Hannah Gunter: But I always you know like that door open and hold on, you know, to hope, hoping that she will one day.

502
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.330
Hannah Gunter: But, but I need to stop that, because all it's doing is hurting me.

503
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:10.890
Richelle Direny: How old is your mom.

504
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.200
Hannah Gunter: My mom is 54

505
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:24.570
Richelle Direny: So, your mom is 54 and you're hoping that one day she will come around after 54 years and say,

506
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.280
Hannah Gunter: Why I'm, I'm hoping she would come around right now.

507
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.180
Hannah Gunter: Nine years from now, not days right now.

508
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.660
Richelle Direny: But if she just says

509
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:44.460
Richelle Direny: The words that you think you want to hear, but she doesn't necessarily mean it. What is it going to

510
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.330
Hannah Gunter: Hurt me even worse.

511
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:55.320
Richelle Direny: So your excellence those expectations. So that's what's that's what's hurting you. It's the

512
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.060
Hannah Gunter: Yes. Yep.

513
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:07.380
Hannah Gunter: Is the expectation of her being a mom to me and it you know it hurts. Even worse, because she is a mom to my brother and my sister.

514
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.220
Richelle Direny: Because maybe in her mind.

515
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:13.590
Richelle Direny: Your dad.

516
00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:20.670
Richelle Direny: Does she think that your dad didn't love them or show them the same affection that he didn't see you.

517
00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.620
Hannah Gunter: I really don't know.

518
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.610
Hannah Gunter: I mean, I know he he gets, you know,

519
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.790
Hannah Gunter: My brother him and my brother are really close. And so our him and my sister so.

520
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.010
Richelle Direny: Your dad is still alive that he

521
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.950
Hannah Gunter: I thought he passed away. Well, when he was

522
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.710
Richelle Direny: Really close to them. But, and you were

523
00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.280
Hannah Gunter: Yeah.

524
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.470
Hannah Gunter: You're the middle Jess Yes.

525
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.460
Huh.

526
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:59.700
Hannah Gunter: Yep What and she blames me she blames me for a lot, and I think that's also where I get the feeling you know of judgmental. People are, you know,

527
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:15.720
Richelle Direny: It goes back to what we talked about. It's all about mom sister and if your brother treated the same way. It's the people who means the most to us that hurts us the deep

528
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.260
Hannah Gunter: Yes. Yep, you're exactly right.

529
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.620
Hannah Gunter: I just think I just need to, you know,

530
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:36.840
Hannah Gunter: Cut off. You know what ties are maybe even there, and you know, just move on and better myself, you know,

531
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.780
Richelle Direny: And because you said that your sister is raising your children. Right.

532
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.640
Hannah Gunter: Well, yeah, her my mom.

533
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:48.510
Richelle Direny: And

534
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:58.440
Richelle Direny: It is a lot. It is a lot and I think it's just a lack of education, not to save that.

535
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.630
Richelle Direny: Choosing a life of addiction is necessarily

536
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:17.010
Richelle Direny: Was the greatest choice, but at the same time. I don't think they realize that often times a person who is an addict or they don't look at it, the person who was an addict is suppressing

537
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.230
Richelle Direny: I'm

538
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.430
Richelle Direny: Just these overwhelming feelings and emotions that

539
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:30.090
Hannah Gunter: They just right. I, I didn't choose to be a drug addict. You know, I feel I was born that way, you know,

540
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.880
Hannah Gunter: I don't feel anyone chooses

541
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.940
Hannah Gunter: You know that kind of life.

542
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:46.980
Richelle Direny: But when you say born that way the reality of it is, it's thinking about when you bring a child into the world and child comes a clean slate, you have to

543
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.230
Hannah Gunter: Innocence, yeah.

544
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:58.680
Richelle Direny: Travel is 100% innocent innocent child is not born an addict. They are not born addicted to anything.

545
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.120
Hannah Gunter: Unless exactly

546
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:06.960
Richelle Direny: It less while you were pregnant, you were pouring the drugs in them, then yes, they are born addicted to it.

547
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:14.250
Hannah Gunter: They're born addicted to it, but not therefore that that's why I say it doesn't define you as a person.

548
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:25.890
Richelle Direny: It doesn't define you as a person. So you when you're born a clean slate and empty a blank slate. You have to pour in, you have to teach you have to do a child wasn't born

549
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.480
Richelle Direny: Knowing how to hate

550
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.830
Richelle Direny: You have to teach them how do you

551
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:50.010
Hannah Gunter: Have to teach them how to. Well, see, I, I don't necessarily agree with that, because I feel, you know, some people are born, the way they're born, they're born with that natural, you know, they just have that that dark side to him, you know that side that does hate that, you know,

552
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.410
Richelle Direny: We all are born with all of these

553
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.120
Hannah Gunter: I don't believe it's taught, no.

554
00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:05.760
Richelle Direny: No, no, no. Not everybody naturally knows how to be bad, like nobody has to teach you how to be bad. I have to teach you how to be good. So, that is true, how ever

555
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:13.950
Richelle Direny: If you have a child and you bring them out and they see fire. Oh, cool. Let me go touch that you

556
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:25.500
Richelle Direny: Have no, don't do that. Right. And so in the same way when you think about addiction in terms of being an addict.

557
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:39.150
Richelle Direny: It has to be introduced to you. And oftentimes, someone says, hey, try that you're hurting you're this, you're that and then you try it and then you realize, oh, I like it stops me from feel

558
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:45.870
Hannah Gunter: Right, because I feel you're born with that with that gene in your body. That's what I believe.

559
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.320
Hannah Gunter: I mean, you know, I could very well be wrong but

560
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:54.660
Hannah Gunter: That's what I believe in. I mean, that's, I believe you are born that way you're

561
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.930
Hannah Gunter: Just like just like set in some instance, you know,

562
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:05.910
Hannah Gunter: Say a female is born into a male's body, you know, they're born into the wrong body.

563
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:19.470
Richelle Direny: So it's all naturally when you look at natural things. It's in terms of understanding from the concept of, you know, when

564
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.900
Richelle Direny: Who somewhat lost all sense of control.

565
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:38.520
Richelle Direny: It's you experienced things in life you experienced something in life. And then you lost all sense of control. You were hurting so bad and you needed to stop the pain and you needed to stop.

566
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:48.120
Hannah Gunter: Right. Yes. And I feel if you have that kind of love, you know, if you have that nurturing love

567
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.870
Hannah Gunter: You know, in some cases it could be different. Yes, I agree.

568
00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:56.460
Richelle Direny: I agree.

569
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.310
Hannah Gunter: I mean, I was dumped the cards I was out

570
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.710
Hannah Gunter: You know i i

571
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.690
Hannah Gunter: I'm doing what I'm doing what I can you know

572
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:18.240
Hannah Gunter: It's, you know, it's a life it's a it's a process, you know, I'll be an addict for the rest of my life. Will I be an active addict.

573
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.020
Richelle Direny: No.

574
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.420
Hannah Gunter: I don't know that because you know I can't tell you what's going to happen. Five minutes from now.

575
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.290
Hannah Gunter: But I do know right now that I am

576
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:32.910
Richelle Direny: I think you froze.

577
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.510
Richelle Direny: I think you froze.

578
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:59.580
Richelle Direny: If you can hear me you froze completely

579
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.220
Hannah Gunter: Oh, okay. Are you there.

580
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.060
Richelle Direny: I'm here.

581
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.670
Hannah Gunter: Okay, I'm sorry. I lost connection.

582
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:27.060
Richelle Direny: Yeah, in, you know, so in, you're absolutely right. Do you have a history of addiction. Are you an addict. Yes. Are you an active addict. No.

583
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:41.220
Richelle Direny: No. No one knows what's going to happen. Five minutes from now, but what you do is put the work. Your goal is not to go back into active addiction. So it's the work and to work through those

584
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:42.600
Hannah Gunter: Obstacles

585
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:54.720
Richelle Direny: The obstacles to that will, you know, put you back in active addiction. So if you work on those, then you will meet your goal of maintaining

586
00:49:55.470 --> 00:50:17.010
Richelle Direny: Sobriety where you won't go back into active addiction. So when you go back to think TALKING ABOUT WHEN DID YOU FIND WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'VE LOST yourself and you said many years ago when you went through what you went through with your, your fam. And it's on rebuilding your self confidence.

587
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:26.250
Hannah Gunter: Right, it's, it, it's made me the person that I am. Mm hmm. And I'm okay with that person. Yes.

588
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.930
Richelle Direny: And that's where you start.

589
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.040
Hannah Gunter: And that's all that matters.

590
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:39.540
Richelle Direny: That's it. It's okay. That's where you start. It's okay with let me identify what the sources and how can I work on

591
00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:52.290
Richelle Direny: Working through it and maybe for one, it's looking at. Have you set the bar high for yourself and for other people, or should you lower it just a little bit to start working on you.

592
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:59.070
Hannah Gunter: Exactly. That's what I I don't even think I have set a bar for myself, let alone other people

593
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.490
Hannah Gunter: And that's why I have this social anxiety that I do.

594
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:11.520
Hannah Gunter: Because they're going to see me how they want to see me no matter what.

595
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.870
Hannah Gunter: And that's just, that's something

596
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.180
Richelle Direny: What is important is how

597
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.000
Hannah Gunter: Horton is how I feel about myself.

598
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:27.780
Hannah Gunter: And that is, but I mean, that also. It's also it's a process.

599
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:34.830
Hannah Gunter: It's a process. It's a strange it's a strange process, it, it's, it's hard. Very long and hard

600
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:43.020
Richelle Direny: He's very long and hard, but you have to start with one thing at a time. And so maybe with one thing at a time. Start with I'm

601
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:50.220
Richelle Direny: Telling saying at least one thing positive about yourself, each thing.

602
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.090
Hannah Gunter: Uh huh.

603
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:56.130
Richelle Direny: And that one thing that you say about whether you say, Anna, Hannah.

604
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.270
Hannah Gunter: You are beautiful and

605
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:07.080
Richelle Direny: That's what you say every day to yourself until you start believing it and understand the depth of what you're saying just start with that alone.

606
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:24.480
Richelle Direny: You're removing everybody else out of the picture me out of your mind, meaning your husband, your grip everybody out of your mind and you're focusing on you and start with your positive self love saying something positive to you each day and believing that

607
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:32.400
Hannah Gunter: And that is a that's a very hard start because I mean that that is that that is that's hard to do.

608
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.580
Hannah Gunter: Because I've seen only the bad in myself, you know, for so long.

609
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.290
Hannah Gunter: But do I know I have great potential. Most definitely.

610
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:50.460
Richelle Direny: So that's it. That's all you say I have great potential no have great central that's all you have to say.

611
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.980
Hannah Gunter: Yeah, for today.

612
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.510
Richelle Direny: It's hard to remember you're owning it. You

613
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.430
Richelle Direny: Know it's hard, you know,

614
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.590
Richelle Direny: And but you're going to

615
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:08.940
Richelle Direny: Push yourself to say it's kind of like thinking about those days when it's hard to get out of bed. But do you have to get out of bed.

616
00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.110
Richelle Direny: I think you froze again.

617
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:24.930
Richelle Direny: Okay, you're back.

618
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.170
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

619
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.470
Hannah Gunter: I lost you for a minute. Rochelle Yeah.

620
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:39.540
Hannah Gunter: Okay, yeah, I'm losing my connection. And I don't know why I don't know what's happening.

621
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:48.990
Richelle Direny: But I was just saying I was just quickly saying is that, you know, like you said, it's how you have already identified, it's hard.

622
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:55.680
Richelle Direny: But think about it. There are days where you don't feel like getting out of bed. But do you have to get out. Right.

623
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.420
Hannah Gunter: Yes.

624
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.290
Richelle Direny: Did you push yourself to get out of bed and it's the same way.

625
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.250
Richelle Direny: I think you froze again. Did you

626
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.450
Richelle Direny: Yes, so let's

627
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.710
Hannah Gunter: I'm sorry I lost you again. Michelle No.

628
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.380
Richelle Direny: I was just about to send you an email but

629
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:44.730
Hannah Gunter: That's just

630
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:49.230
Richelle Direny: But like I said, we're going to start off with just say one thing, positive I'm

631
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:50.520
Hannah Gunter: Positive about myself.

632
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.240
Richelle Direny: No matter how

633
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.730
Richelle Direny: Hard, it is you're still going to say, even if it just one time for the date, but you're going to push yourself. Okay.

634
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.170
Hannah Gunter: Okay, yeah, like that.

635
00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.100
Okay.

636
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:01.350
Richelle Direny: Let's, um,

637
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:10.170
Richelle Direny: Let us put on the castle. Let's start off. Now what is best for every other week, or every week.

638
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.660
Hannah Gunter: Every other week. Right.

639
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:12.930
Hannah Gunter: Now,

640
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.010
Richelle Direny: Every other week Mondays at seven o'clock. Is that good for you.

641
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:20.070
Richelle Direny: you muted yourself.

642
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.640
Hannah Gunter: Or Tuesdays okay for you.

643
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.060
Richelle Direny: Do you but you have groups on Tuesdays. Don't you

644
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.420
Richelle Direny: Right, but it would have to be Monday.

645
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.730
Hannah Gunter: Monday. OK. OK. So Monday at seven and yes and

646
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:44.280
Richelle Direny: I hold on. I don't think I have anything on the 10. So that would be the next time.

647
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.940
Hannah Gunter: Okay, every other week. So February tip.

648
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.450
Richelle Direny: Yes, I look

649
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.430
Richelle Direny: At seven. Alright.

650
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.140
Hannah Gunter: That sounds good, Rochelle.

651
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.290
Richelle Direny: All right then. So in the meantime we'll just check in. If you need a question in between that, just like you did.

652
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.460
Hannah Gunter: Okay, now

653
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.420
Hannah Gunter: But yeah

654
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.410
Richelle Direny: I mean, it is a long stretch between we meet again, but just

655
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:13.380
Hannah Gunter: If I need you. I will. I'll email you or something.

656
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.860
Richelle Direny: Yes, but what what is, what is your goal. What are you going to work on.

657
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.490
Hannah Gunter: I'm going to work on saying one positive thing every day about myself.

658
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.640
Richelle Direny: Even if it's just one time for the day, it's going to try

659
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.880
Hannah Gunter: Okay, yes. Thank you, Michelle.

660
00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.200
Richelle Direny: You're welcome. Bye bye.

661
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.100
Bye bye.

662
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.050
Brandon Higginbotham: Hello.

663
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:39.660
Richelle Direny: Oh,

664
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.570
Brandon Higginbotham: Can you hear me. Yes, I can hear.

665
00:56:44.970 --> 00:57:00.720
Brandon Higginbotham: It appears as if he still had you on the calendar with Maggie. Yeah, well I just called in. That's the number they gave me they gave me her meeting ID. So that's why late right now. Yeah, but I don't know why they had to encounter. I had you on my calendar.

666
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:03.660
So,

667
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:10.590
Richelle Direny: So just, you will hit when your email you set a bio cycle. You don't have a bias already did.

668
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:20.040
Brandon Higginbotham: Oh yeah, we'll see. That's what they told me when I tried to schedule my counseling, like a week and a half ago. They told me I needed to complete that. And I wasn't sure exactly what that was.

669
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:23.100
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you did that back with Maggie. Remember

670
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:27.210
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I remember having a meeting with her. I just went to her like what it was called or anything.

671
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:35.280
Richelle Direny: But so I sent Maggie. A MESSAGE. SAID THAT YOU HAD you had been a notional three different on three different occasions.

672
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:49.320
Brandon Higginbotham: I tried to like call in and like, Jamie. That's my care coordinator Navigator. She told me that Maggie's or Natalie's availability wasn't posted yet, and she can give me any information and that was posted

673
00:57:52.770 --> 00:58:05.730
Richelle Direny: Well, we'll try to figure out what's going on because sometimes they do put on the schedule without their knowledge and because I had sent an email. I know that she she didn't have any of them.

674
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.290
Richelle Direny: So hold on let me pull up

675
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.880
Richelle Direny: Now, in that. Have you met with her for an individual before in the past.

676
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:20.280
Brandon Higginbotham: Maggie, Maggie.

677
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:28.620
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, yeah. I had that one meeting with her and then like every time I tried to schedule another 100 level ability wasn't there. So like they want my supposed to do.

678
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:41.700
Brandon Higginbotham: Has Dr. Jamison like she was getting like very strict with the Council and meetings and stuff. And I was like, I'm, I'm trying to schedule. I can't. There's nothing like if I'm told her availabilities not there. You know me.

679
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.340
Richelle Direny: Well,

680
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:58.230
Richelle Direny: I'll see because I mean our, our, our schedules, kind of get filled a little quicker. But I think for me I am now kind of scheduling my own

681
00:58:59.250 --> 00:58:59.580
Brandon Higginbotham: Right.

682
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:05.550
Richelle Direny: I don't I you know I do find people show up in then I'm like, I didn't happen so

683
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.000
Yeah.

684
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:12.120
Richelle Direny: I think it's just what's more feasible and having an ongoing on

685
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:13.950
Richelle Direny: Our

686
00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:25.440
Richelle Direny: Schedule, whether it's based on my sessions I determine whether or not once a month, once every other week or whatever it's feasible and financially affordable as

687
01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.510
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what

688
01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.140
Richelle Direny: What time do you go to your group.

689
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.190
Brandon Higginbotham: My group said is at 12 eastern time on Tuesdays.

690
01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.090
Richelle Direny: Okay. Every, every Tuesday, you go to from every Tuesday.

691
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.010
Brandon Higginbotham: Yes, ma'am. Okay.

692
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.410
Richelle Direny: Oh, it seems like you have

693
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.540
Richelle Direny: So you're still in school right now.

694
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.090
Brandon Higginbotham: I'm actually just started a backup.

695
01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:53.520
Richelle Direny: You're in law school.

696
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:54.360
Brandon Higginbotham: This man.

697
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.420

699
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:10.740
Richelle Direny: So when you're in Knoxville. That's you. At the same time, you work on getting credentials in multiple states or how does that work.

700
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:18.060
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, if I also have to take the bar in the States, but those are the three states, and then I'll be able to practice in and be able to take the bar and

701
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.640
Brandon Higginbotham: Like once I graduate law school.

702
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.060
Richelle Direny: Barring offering me

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.430
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah yeah it's through concord law school.

704
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.040
Richelle Direny: That's a lot of study.

705
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.120
Yes, ma'am.

706
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:38.670
Richelle Direny: Okay.

707
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:43.710
Richelle Direny: And you graduate in three years.

708
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:51.000
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I finished my pre law back in 2013 when I graduated with a 3.8 GPA.

709
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:53.430
Oh,

710
01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:03.480
Richelle Direny: So you're working on maintaining your sobriety. That's good. And this career path is pretty stressful isn't not

711
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.740
Brandon Higginbotham: Yes, it can be

712
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:09.990
Richelle Direny: So you work full time and are in law school.

713
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:10.740
This man.

714
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.630
Richelle Direny: Wow, that's, that's, and how are you managing that

715
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.520
Brandon Higginbotham: One day at a time.

716
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.580
Richelle Direny: That's a good answer.

717
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.280
Richelle Direny: Because all you can take it.

718
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.820
Richelle Direny: One day at a time. Right. Yes.

719
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:31.890
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, so do you go to any outside

720
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:34.800
Richelle Direny: Programs.

721
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:41.220
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, me and my wife, we go to like in a couple times a week, a couple different meetings locally here.

722
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.390
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay. Great. And then you do groups here with bright heart.

723
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.170
Correct.

724
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.860
Richelle Direny: So how long have you been with bright heart.

725
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:59.850
Brandon Higginbotham: November. Yes, it's, I think it was mid October Maven first part of November. Yeah.

726
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:07.380
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, and this has been much more feasible for you to write our program.

727
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:13.140
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, that's definitely it takes like the travel time out and give me a little more time to work around the schedule.

728
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:15.870
Richelle Direny: Okay.

729
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:26.220
Richelle Direny: All right, so I'm for you. Just in trying to because I would have to find out with Maggie, I know her schedule is limited.

730
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:48.360
Richelle Direny: And I don't you know I'm not sure what exactly for you is it that you just wanted to meet with another therapist one time because I know Dr. Jamison she really advocates for not just the groups, but she also advocates for therapy as well.

731
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.660
Brandon Higginbotham: Not

732
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:53.910
Richelle Direny: Even have to meet every week and everybody's at a different place in their life.

733
01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:02.310
Richelle Direny: Different season in their life. So they don't necessarily have to meet every week and financially, no matter how stressed, you are financially, if you

734
01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:03.570
Richelle Direny: Can't afford it every week you

735
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.730
Richelle Direny: Can afford it every week and I'm reasonable in

736
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:06.180
Richelle Direny: That way.

737
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:16.170
Richelle Direny: So if it's once a month, but what have you but I guess what I'm trying to establish what is your hope in

738
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:27.810
Richelle Direny: Moving forward with the sessions like what are you looking to accomplish because I also don't want to necessarily start and then say, OK, now go back to your therapist or

739
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.520
Richelle Direny: Trying to

740
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:43.260
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, the reason I put in that email that I was willing to meet with a different counselor what because, to my knowledge, what I was told I needed to complete that bps and you said already completed that that was one of my tend to work with that.

741
01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.650
Richelle Direny: So it was just more. So just to complete the bio

742
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.850
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah yeah

743
01:04:51.810 --> 01:05:06.120
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, but even if, during your initial bio with Maggie. I'm trying to establish like what was the plan, moving forward, what was her recommendation I should

744
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.830
Brandon Higginbotham: Say in initially said is like once a month is when when I needed to meet with her.

745
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.450
Richelle Direny: And what were the recommendations in terms of

746
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.000
Richelle Direny: Work on

747
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:27.600
Brandon Higginbotham: Us. Well, I'm not really sure because like it's been when I meet with her back in November.

748
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:39.840
Brandon Higginbotham: I'd be lying to you if I told you I know we just basically talked to see like got a rundown about how my life and things like that. So I'm not really, you know,

749
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:47.640
Brandon Higginbotham: Sure of like what the main goals were, and all that. I know maintain sobriety, DEFINITELY BY OTHER NIGHT.

750
01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.240
Richelle Direny: Okay, so it was mainly to

751
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:51.480
Brandon Higginbotham: Meet

752
01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:54.870
Richelle Direny: Me at the time is to maintain your sobriety. Yeah.

753
01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:03.150
Richelle Direny: Okay, now I do notice here that one of the things that you follow up with the psychiatrists for further assessment.

754
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.980
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah yeah cuz I got PTSD bipolar one into

755
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.220
Brandon Higginbotham: Anxiety with depression, all that

756
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:12.870
Richelle Direny: Okay.

757
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:16.500
Richelle Direny: But we were you able to follow up with us as

758
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:27.060
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, I've been trying to make an appointment and like, I don't know if you're familiar with, like how psychiatry works but like you got a schedule like a month or two in advance before you can even get in so

759
01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:33.240
Richelle Direny: You spend. Well, yes, because it's a lot that goes into some take insurance, some don't.

760
01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.420
Richelle Direny: Work well and it's awful lot of different no matter what state you're in the same issues with psychiatrists

761
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:40.620
Brandon Higginbotham: But

762
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:53.520
Richelle Direny: Typically when you do finally get that appointment. I'm usually follow up with them once a month after yeah produce medication because they don't necessarily talk therapy.

763
01:06:54.150 --> 01:07:01.020
Richelle Direny: Right. But now, since you've met with her back in November. You have not had the opportunity to

764
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:07.110
Richelle Direny: Know it, have you do you have private insurance.

765
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:08.190
Brandon Higginbotham: I got Medicaid

766
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:15.270
Richelle Direny: Medicaid and so and so that also is the determining factor in finding a psychiatrist because of the insurance.

767
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.300
Richelle Direny: Medical. Unfortunately, it's not pretty rapid and getting you

768
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:22.860
Brandon Higginbotham: Know,

769
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.120
Richelle Direny: When you become a lawyer, maybe you can try to explore

770
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.900
Richelle Direny: Different states that you working

771
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:44.970
Richelle Direny: Well, but I would definitely recommend you know called contract to Medicaid to see if you haven't already done so, just getting now are you on any kind of medication for the mental illness.

772
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.310
Brandon Higginbotham: That, oh yeah, I probably should be that

773
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.370
Richelle Direny: I mean how long ago, were you diagnosed with

774
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.630
Brandon Higginbotham: last summer's when they gave me all that diagnosis.

775
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.070
Richelle Direny: And who were, who was the one that diagnosis.

776
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.550
Brandon Higginbotham: There's a local psychiatrist or

777
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.680
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, then that's hearing Greenfield where I live and

778
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:12.090
Brandon Higginbotham: Like she's the one that gave me all the diagnosis. I'm like, Okay.

779
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:14.370
Brandon Higginbotham: So,

780
01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.950
Richelle Direny: Okay. And, um, and you're not able to follow back up with my car insurance.

781
01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:31.500
Brandon Higginbotham: Honestly, I did not like her at all. I love. I think she just like I tried to call her a quarter to three days in a row asked her to return my call. She never returned any calls

782
01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:40.290
Brandon Higginbotham: And then I showed up out there and I swear, she locked the door or maybe even 10 minutes before they close and okay i was like i did not like this one.

783
01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:45.360
Richelle Direny: Then you haven't been able to find another psychiatrist.

784
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:47.400
Brandon Higginbotham: No, I haven't really had much time.

785
01:08:48.210 --> 01:09:03.210
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. Um, now you know with every insurance company and you know I'm not going to say strongly for Medicaid, but typically what most insurance companies do have a case manager or you are, you have the ability to go on line.

786
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.430
Brandon Higginbotham: With that Molina so

787
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.570
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so you should you should have a case manager with Molina

788
01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:10.080
Brandon Higginbotham: I do

789
01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:22.020
Richelle Direny: One with, um, or even going online to look through to see who is you know what psychiatry except Medicaid in your state.

790
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:31.350
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, like Selena has a specific website. I can go on and actually filter down to what I need to find and I can do that. Yes, yes.

791
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:34.200
Richelle Direny: It's, I mean, not everything is really at your fingertips.

792
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.560
Brandon Higginbotham: Right, you can you can look into them.

793
01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:42.990
Richelle Direny: To try them to. I mean, I would definitely encourage it. I mean, you know,

794
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:56.520
Richelle Direny: Now I'm not going to knock if you do you experience a trauma and you have whether PTSD or bipolar disorder and all the different stuff. But I mean, a lot of times when I've worked with people. And I'm like, really. Who told you you on that.

795
01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:10.050
Richelle Direny: But it is something that you find more often, that it is affecting you know different things are affecting your life, whether it's the trauma, whether it's the anxiety.

796
01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:25.470
Richelle Direny: You have, you know, experience mania. How long is the manual and if it's in interrupting your life and something that truly needs to be addressed and treated. I really truly encourage that you follow up with a psychiatrist to monitor the medical

797
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.490
Brandon Higginbotham: You know place on that to

798
01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:44.370
Richelle Direny: Help you with it. Um, I with anything. I truly encourage and I really encourage everyone that I meet with that you know therapy, along with Medicaid, like the two is a perfect marriage. Yeah.

799
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:46.680
Brandon Higginbotham: Kinda hand in hand.

800
01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.220
Brandon Higginbotham: They

801
01:10:47.280 --> 01:11:02.940
Richelle Direny: go hand in hand, you know, medication is only to put you at a level state. So you can think until you can process. And so you can work through whatever it is that you need to work through. I'm just taking medication and not doing the other piece.

802
01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:05.160
Brandon Higginbotham: Correct. I did like the circle pointless.

803
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:10.980
Richelle Direny: And then you say, oh, well, my goal is to get off the medication. Well, I mean,

804
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.990
Richelle Direny: You know until you address the

805
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:19.890
Richelle Direny: Issue, you're not really going to ever successfully come off that medication, without going back on the, you know, answers wheel.

806
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:28.620
Richelle Direny: Yep, so I definitely really I try to encourage everyone I know, life happens I listen I'm human.

807
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.880
Richelle Direny: We all have issues.

808
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.860
Richelle Direny: The world is not getting any

809
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.900
Richelle Direny: Financial easier. It's getting harder.

810
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:57.300
Richelle Direny: So I do completely understand but I you know I did you meet for a session. It's all it takes a long email and say, Hey, can I reschedule something different, but the psychiatry definitely follow through on that I'm working with Dr. And find therapist.

811
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:04.020
Richelle Direny: Now I see that you talk to her about sleep. Are you having issues with sleep.

812
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:05.910
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, yeah. I still do.

813
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.450
Brandon Higginbotham: Have you thinking about your Jason

814
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:17.520
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, she gave me a circle. And I mean, it helps a little bit but not to the point where I can still rest comfortably know

815
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:20.220
Richelle Direny: How hours do you sleep right

816
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:25.800
Brandon Higginbotham: Like straight hair. I might be lucky to get like two hours here when I'm up

817
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.830
Brandon Higginbotham: To more hour to talk to them at all.

818
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:32.370
Richelle Direny: So I was actually meeting with

819
01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:42.960
Richelle Direny: Another patient who was a little cranky oftentimes very, very cranky. I think we had a session where it was like pretty intense.

820
01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:54.000
Richelle Direny: And so it was just like, you know, it went from kind of like one to two to one day, like a shout out to like eight or nine not like our buddy like you really need to kind of tone it down a little bit. Yeah.

821
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.830
Richelle Direny: This went on for a few sessions. And do you know what the source of his issue was

822
01:12:59.280 --> 01:12:59.820
Richelle Direny: Leslie

823
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:16.440
Richelle Direny: Like a sweet and so finally, I'm like all right after an hour and a half session, um, where, you know, typically the sessions or an hour, but like 30 minutes over. I wasn't Emily keep him hanging. I'm like, listen, you need to talk to the doctor, you're not getting any sleep.

824
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:26.670
Richelle Direny: Described a medic. I want us to maybe Sarah cool too. And all of a sudden one day, I was like, I didn't know you could smile.

825
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:29.250
Richelle Direny: And

826
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.040
Richelle Direny: He started getting a little bit of sleep.

827
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:43.740
Richelle Direny: It wasn't that he was going through eight hours now all of a sudden, but it went from like you said, the two hours of sleep to about four hours.

828
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.650
Richelle Direny: And made a little bit of a difference.

829
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.610
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah definitely affects your men mental stability, they don't get enough sleep so

830
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:56.190
Richelle Direny: I mean, anxiety, does kind of somewhat affects your sleep too if

831
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.810
Richelle Direny: You have anxiety and your mind is racing racing thoughts on all kinds of things.

832
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.460
Brandon Higginbotham: Are 50 all day long.

833
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:04.950
Brandon Higginbotham: It is due

834
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:21.120
Richelle Direny: So if you have a lot on your mind, and it's working through kind of like, you know, kind of bringing down the anxiety, a little bit so you can get some sleep. Um, but also in addition to taking the medication to help the situation. I mean,

835
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:30.540
Richelle Direny: You're kind of walking a path there that can be very stressful. You're in law school. So you do need your mental capacity.

836
01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.610
Richelle Direny: Right focus

837
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:46.860
Richelle Direny: So, speak to her that if she prescribed a circle and you haven't really seen the improvement over the course of like two, three weeks, then definitely talk to her, so she can maybe up it if they need to be okay.

838
01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:52.560
Richelle Direny: Okay, because I did see that works for the one patient. It was just like night and day. All of a sudden

839
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.400
Yep.

840
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.060
Richelle Direny: Now it says one of the goals was to obtain employment.

841
01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:08.580
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, finally did that.

842
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.980
And I see here

843
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:21.000
Richelle Direny: Yet driver's license will reinstate in the next three to six months.

844
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:26.010
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah. What I have to do there. I just got to get an SRO 22 then that's like reinstated so

845
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.230
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, um, was it your license was revoked.

846
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:48.060
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, I ended up getting pulled over, back in 2017 I think was May of 2017 and I was drinking prior and it you know he's drinking a little bit. And when the deputy pulled me over well.

847
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:54.930
Brandon Higginbotham: He said that if I would have waited 30 minutes I would have been good enough to drive not like, can we just stay in here for 30 minutes

848
01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:01.020
Brandon Higginbotham: And he's like, unfortunately, I know under, under that company up

849
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.830
Richelle Direny: Oh, and so for them it was, um, suspending

850
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:10.170
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, they got suspended and then like already paid my reinstatement fee and all that just got to get in. So 22

851
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.060
Richelle Direny: What is that

852
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.250
Brandon Higginbotham: That's a like

853
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:30.540
Brandon Higginbotham: A bond of insurance where you got to hold it for like three years. I think it is. And if you don't hold it for the three year time and if you get caught drive and then you get driving under suspension and all that good stuff. But it's basically just maintaining insurance.

854
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:31.770
Actually

855
01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:41.130
Richelle Direny: Okay, and now you're in Ohio. Right.

856
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.780
Brandon Higginbotham: Yep. Okay.

857
01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:49.710
Richelle Direny: Okay then. So, so while the what I was going over what some of the things that she

858
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:55.470
Richelle Direny: Um,

859
01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:01.710
Richelle Direny: Those are some of the things that she recommended or what are some short term goals.

860
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.670
Richelle Direny: For you, so. About the only thing is that you did get a job. You said right

861
01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:16.500
Richelle Direny: Okay. So pretty much everything else is ongoing. Um, I would definitely recommend speaking to Dr. Jamison and

862
01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.340
Richelle Direny: Attended weekly groups which that you have

863
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:35.070
Richelle Direny: And, you know, look, you're working on, but reach out to the insurance company. Now what is I should ask, what was your goal in terms of when you join Bernhard health

864
01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:37.350
Richelle Direny: Outside of maintaining sobriety.

865
01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.940
Brandon Higginbotham: Or maintaining years writing because it

866
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.550
Richelle Direny: Sounds like you've been doing that for the last three years.

867
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:45.990
Richelle Direny: Is that okay so what what is your ultimate goal.

868
01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:53.910
Brandon Higginbotham: advance my career and actually get my feet on the ground and run with it is what I want to do.

869
01:17:55.170 --> 01:18:01.590
Richelle Direny: Now now with that. How can be hope you back to the right heart.

870
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:10.830
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, I mean like continued like group meetings because like I like being active like during the groups and stuff so that helps a lot. And

871
01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:24.960
Brandon Higginbotham: I know just really basically just having like people there that I could speak with you know that helps a little bit too because I don't really like being in a big group of people, although I fit in, like, a chameleon. I don't like being around a bunch of people but

872
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.790
Brandon Higginbotham: It helps that way to go. Okay, now

873
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:36.090
Richelle Direny: What is a goal ultimate outsider, because to maintain your sobriety. That's more long term that's

874
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:36.600
Brandon Higginbotham: A given that

875
01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:48.720
Richelle Direny: That's going to be over time. Now, outside of that, what other goal for you like immediate when you think about, you know, another goal that you would try to

876
01:18:49.530 --> 01:19:08.190
Richelle Direny: Through bright heart through the resource you have now the platform you have now you know what would that you can get through this telemedicine. What is it that you would like to work on if given the opportunity which you're being given what would you like to work on.

877
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.490
Brandon Higginbotham: Hmm, that's good question.

878
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:20.640
Brandon Higginbotham: A goal that I would like to work on with the tools that I'm giving right now through bright heart health.

879
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:32.970
Brandon Higginbotham: Maybe pass on the knowledge, maybe other people that struggling, that maybe I could get them involved in the program. Maybe something

880
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:45.030
Richelle Direny: Okay, now when you look at you've maintained, and that is something like pass on that you you maintain your sobriety. For the last three years. And what was your drug of choice.

881
01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:46.440
Brandon Higginbotham: Heroin said no.

882
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:58.140
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you would like to pass on your knowledge or what have you. For free while you're in for therapy. But my question is this, that

883
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.290
Richelle Direny: When you look at

884
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:04.890
Richelle Direny: Now let me back it up a little bit.

885
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:12.000
Richelle Direny: Would you like to eventually in the future over time as a long time.

886
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:15.990
Richelle Direny: To be tapered off on this song.

887
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:27.450
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, like every time. Like, right now it really helps cuz I mean carbs, the cravings. Like, I don't have any of those. And you know, I mean, it helps but yeah overtime. I'd like to get off of it.

888
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:39.840
Richelle Direny: Okay, so when you look at until what I'm trying to kind of guide in terms of looking at goal we're working on. When you say curve, the cravings, like what are some things that

889
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.300
Would

890
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:51.510
Richelle Direny: And as I as I work with everyone. I look at it from the standpoint of

891
01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.060
Richelle Direny: You

892
01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:00.060
Richelle Direny: Part of the addiction is to suppress

893
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:15.270
Richelle Direny: Your so suppressing an emotion, you've lost control you have your coping skill is reaching for something that will help you to numb your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions. Right, right.

894
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:39.180
Richelle Direny: Yes, man. So, that is what you are the person. And so in some ways, though the Suboxone is helping it still is a form of the band aid to what you don't completely fully have control over or haven't fully learned how to gain control over something in your life that brings about

895
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:41.640
Richelle Direny: Comments or what have you.

896
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:42.720
Richelle Direny: And

897
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:57.780
Richelle Direny: What is that, because until you address that elephant. It will be hard for you to ever taper off of the Suboxone because I remove the Suboxone the cravings come back up because the issues are still there. And for you. What is that

898
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:10.590
Brandon Higginbotham: Well, like my childhood. It was all messed up all kinds of messed up all me my whole life, then all kind of messed up. I just got to take control back of my life and take the reins, you know,

899
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:23.700
Richelle Direny: In the last three years you have been somewhat successful in gaining that control, but you need to kind of get that control my luck.

900
01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:30.720
Richelle Direny: Yes. And what is something that's hindering you fully getting back on.

901
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:34.770
Brandon Higginbotham: Oh man, that's good advice never really thought about it.

902
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:42.120
Brandon Higginbotham: I'm not really sure how to answer that.

903
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:53.400
Richelle Direny: Because the reality is, I mean, your passes your past, you can't really do it like you said your childhood and you know is all kinds of messed up. And you can't really

904
01:22:53.850 --> 01:23:00.360
Richelle Direny: I think if we can all go back in our paths. I mean, I don't know what this world would look like if we could go on to the path.

905
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.790
Richelle Direny: I don't know what the world would look like.

906
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.910
If

907
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.590
Richelle Direny: It is our past, but we can

908
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:15.180
Richelle Direny: Use our past to rewrite what our future looks like in terms of the decisions we make.

909
01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:22.410
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, just like using the past is like lessons and then just, like, make sure you learn from it. That's what I tried to do

910
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.270
Richelle Direny: Exactly, exactly. And in that

911
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:41.340
Richelle Direny: What when you look at you know in the past. If you drink and use it because it's one thing to drink and say, oh, you know, I'll have a little drink and then you're done. But it's like

912
01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:49.200
Richelle Direny: You keep going. You keep going. You keep going. You keep going to the point where you have no sense of you, you've lost all sense of control.

913
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:57.960
Richelle Direny: And it's not like you know it's fun, it's exciting. Let's go. You know, like, okay, you know, I like dancing. Let's go dancing. That's not how we use alcohol. Let's go dancing.

914
01:23:58.350 --> 01:24:12.900
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you use it for something else. So for you, is it whether it's thinking about maybe your childhood, like the relationship with your mom with your dad or, you know, is it impacting the relationship with your wife. Do you have children.

915
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.370
Brandon Higginbotham: We don't

916
01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:38.520
Richelle Direny: Okay, but either whatever that is. It's like, what is that and and have over the years, have you pretty much developed somewhat of a solid foundation in learning how to work through different adversities that you're faced with or do you crumble at those adversities

917
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.280
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, pretty much like freeze up

918
01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:53.430
Richelle Direny: And so it's identifying the, what is that so crippling about those adversities. What is the fear is it that you lack

919
01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.390
Richelle Direny: Trust within yourself, is it

920
01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.170
Brandon Higginbotham: And

921
01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:11.160
Richelle Direny: That brings on the anxiety. And so looking at from that lens. How can you work through that because once you identify what that is and you start working through it.

922
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.160
Richelle Direny: You're, you're your

923
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:20.940
Richelle Direny: Cravings with somewhat start decreasing because you're bringing it into your awareness to work through

924
01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:30.480
Hmm.

925
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:37.350
Brandon Higginbotham: That's on that I'd have to think about the see like next I dig deeper. A little bit. But I'd have to do

926
01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:53.310
Richelle Direny: You know, oftentimes our issues is not something that we necessarily have to dig deep for. It's that it's there. But sometimes we feel, bring me if I speak it out. I'm worse facing

927
01:25:54.900 --> 01:26:00.600
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm pretty strong willed and minded and everything, but like

928
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:07.920
Brandon Higginbotham: There's a lot of stuff like even from my childhood like my sister. She's, she's three years younger than me and

929
01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:20.940
Brandon Higginbotham: Like she's, she's like, rather than do you remember this that I was like I had no idea what you're talking about. Like there's stuff that she remembers that I have absolutely no clue about like I blocked it out. Like, I don't remember years of my childhood and I was like okay

930
01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.210
Richelle Direny: And so because of trauma oftentimes the trauma is so

931
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:31.530
Richelle Direny: Deep that we train ourselves to complete lockdown.

932
01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:37.320
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, like there's a couple different years that I can't remember anything.

933
01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:47.700
Richelle Direny: It's funny. It's funny that our minds, we have the ability, without realizing it. So blocked out chunks of our childhood.

934
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:52.890
Richelle Direny: Trauma is so much that we find a way to block it out.

935
01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:05.850
Richelle Direny: Because you don't want to face it, but not realizing that the things that we do today and the behaviors that we display today is a direct correlation to

936
01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:24.000
Richelle Direny: That traumatic experience you've had as a child that you kind of blocked out a new mom and some would say, well why bring it up if you don't remember why Bermuda. But could it be, that's the reason why it's affecting your today.

937
01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.160
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I guess the way I see it is like if I don't remember it. Then I can't bother me.

938
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.020
Richelle Direny: Have you ever had those feelings, where you know I feel away or I'm angry and I just don't know why.

939
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.230
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah a lot. I do that a lot. Mm hmm.

940
01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:53.220
Richelle Direny: It's because subconsciously we suppress it deep down in our subconscious and it's trying to wanting to escape, and you're like, nope. Nope, you can say that down there. Nope. Nope.

941
01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:02.310
Richelle Direny: I want to do it. Nope, nope, nope, move that's putting that down there, but not realizing that maybe the history

942
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:03.360
Brandon Higginbotham: Of if you

943
01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:12.240
Richelle Direny: Have alcohol abuse. If you have addiction to heroin. If you have all these things. That was your way of training yourself versatile.

944
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:13.590
Brandon Higginbotham: Yes.

945
01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:22.740
Brandon Higginbotham: And and even as even as a child like I come home from school. I definitely want to go to sleep. Just, I would have to deal with it.

946
01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:24.990
Brandon Higginbotham: That's how it was.

947
01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:26.250
Richelle Direny: And

948
01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.190
It's a way of teaching us how to do

949
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:37.410
Richelle Direny: I remember some time ago I watched this movie and

950
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:46.890
Richelle Direny: She was like, it was like a Tyler Perry movie but like sometimes he makes movies are really very deep. Yeah.

951
01:28:47.970 --> 01:29:01.020
Richelle Direny: It was, I can't remember that. But I think her addiction or this is an addiction. She had become addicted to I think she had a sexual addiction.

952
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:24.210
Richelle Direny: That was her addiction. Yeah. And it became she was just really, it became out of control. She lost all power of control and it was through therapy that she realized that from the age of I think there was 10 was a significant number and through cycle therapy, she realized that

953
01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:37.980
Richelle Direny: The biggest trauma that occurred in her life happened at that age, and she kept it so suppressed. She didn't realize that her current addiction was a direct relation to the sexual trauma.

954
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:50.670
Richelle Direny: And it was until she allowed herself to bring it out into the face it. That's when she started the healing process because it was at the age of 10

955
01:29:51.150 --> 01:30:10.830
Richelle Direny: Something really bad happened with her and she didn't realize that what was going on with her today had something to do with what have that from the trauma that she suppressed that she just couldn't remember what she refused to remember she had buried so deep down in our subconscious.

956
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.570
Brandon Higginbotham: What's the name of that movie.

957
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:15.540
Richelle Direny: Oh god, you know,

958
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.940
Brandon Higginbotham: I could probably google it.

959
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.870
Richelle Direny: It was oh god I cannot. I cannot remember

960
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:40.410
Richelle Direny: I cannot remember it. I'm gonna think about it and email it to you, but it was. It's a Tyler Perry movie and what it was through therapy that at some point later on through the therapy, she realized that she had buried so deep, deep down,

961
01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:57.480
Richelle Direny: That she didn't because every time the therapist would ask her the same thing that you would say to your sister. Yeah. Are the blowing off. She didn't want to talk about it. She didn't want to go there. No, no, nope, nope, nope, nope, not because the trauma was so severe.

962
01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.310
Richelle Direny: And the minute she brought it up and out. That's when her human started

963
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.200
Brandon Higginbotham: So it was it was the movie called addicted.

964
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.330
Richelle Direny: You know, what do you want

965
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:14.580
Richelle Direny: Yes.

966
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:16.920
Richelle Direny: Did you find it so quick.

967
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:17.880
And Google

968
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.780
Richelle Direny: I think that's what it was called

969
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.970
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, it was came out in 2014

970
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:30.630
Richelle Direny: There you go. Here you go. And so, and for me. I mean, maybe if it's because it's my my

971
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:49.230
Richelle Direny: My profession. When I watched it like it was like, whoa. It was such an eye opener and that often times you don't you don't realize that the decisions that you're making right now and what's going on with you right now has a direct correlation to something experience as a child.

972
01:31:52.500 --> 01:32:03.210
Richelle Direny: So, but, in that sense, I brought it up and I just kind of pointed it out just so it's for you to think about, you know, here it is that you have this platform, you have this opportunity.

973
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:12.330
Richelle Direny: And you know you speak about what is it that you would like to work on during your time here while you're in this program.

974
01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:17.700
That's it.

975
01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:19.440
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah.

976
01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:29.220
Richelle Direny: No, I was saying I was just thinking like if you if it's not something it's something that you need to really think about then, you know, something that you just have to think

977
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.010
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah yeah

978
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:40.440
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I mean I like oh no I like listening to

979
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:46.170
Brandon Higginbotham: Mr. Reinhart and everything, you know, he makes a lot of points like mindfulness and

980
01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:53.790
Brandon Higginbotham: No, no. Oh no, he when he starts talking about like mindfulness. I like listening.

981
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.150
Brandon Higginbotham: Then it makes a lot of sense. It really does.

982
01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:09.060
Richelle Direny: You know, unlock it makes sense. Is it the question is putting it into practice and how effective are we in putting all that makes sense.

983
01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:16.800
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I mean, it really depends on the person, because I mean everything makes sense differently to each individual

984
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.810
Richelle Direny: But personalizing it to your son.

985
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.640
Richelle Direny: Are you meditating on it and putting it into practice or finding a way that you can put it into practice.

986
01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.860
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, I mean,

987
01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:36.990
Brandon Higginbotham: Yeah, like on after groups and everything like I talked to my wife about it.

988
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:51.480
Brandon Higginbotham: I mean, she's a great conversation. And anyway, so I mean that just haven't heard there to listen and you know I know she's like on the same level as I am, when it comes to thinking and not a lot of people can keep up with me. Anyway, so

989
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.280
Brandon Higginbotham: She's one of the very few

990
01:33:56.250 --> 01:33:58.830
Richelle Direny: How long have you been been married

991
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.710
Brandon Higginbotham: Like a year.

992
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.240
Richelle Direny: Very new very new.

993
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:08.160
Richelle Direny: Anyway,

994
01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:20.070
Richelle Direny: Okay, so. But yeah, definitely. Think about it. Um, I mean, I'll let out I'll check in with Maggie to let her know now.

995
01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:21.960
Richelle Direny: How

996
01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:25.260
Richelle Direny: If you were supposed to check in.

997
01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.270
Richelle Direny: Whether it's once every other week, once a month, what is

998
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:33.000
Richelle Direny: What is convenient for you.

999

1025
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:42.090
