00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Have you you've been down there a couple of times.

21
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.620
Adam Frederick: I've never been done a Google about it and the land outside of Georgia.

22
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.190
Adam Frederick: So cheap and nice thing.

23
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:17.280
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Is you know a lot of people from Ohio. Once you hit 75 you just take it straight on in there. But just to let you know if you if you live in Atlanta.

24
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:30.720
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: There's no time day or the week that you don't really travel that you're not going to have some type of traffic jam. I mean, even on the weekends and that's the thing, it's everybody's moved here so much that if you don't like traffic.

25
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.500
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It'll be problematic and i don't i don't like traffic.

26
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.790
Adam Frederick: Yeah, no problem, man.

27
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.190
Adam Frederick: Like

28
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.240
Adam Frederick: Atlanta now.

29
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.440
Adam Frederick: Every night is just like a party. It's like it's crazy.

30
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You know, that's what they tell me, it probably is. And then like if you live in the Fulton County area where a lot of it is, but

31
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.220
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: The thing is, is that now. The city has gone outside of the inner city. So there's so many pockets of city.

32
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:16.380
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Area. But you're right, if you go and you get some land outside of the city area is prettier. And I think that's one of the reasons people really like come into Georgia because you can get quality land and still have still a lot of activities, a little come a lot

33
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.850
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Of cultural things to do to

34
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.280
Adam Frederick: Just like outside

35
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.960
Adam Frederick: Like they're weird, like the white cops are weird and racist.

36
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.840
Adam Frederick: Well, I will say that like

37
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:43.740
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: You're, you're right. And I think it probably has to do with some of the culture, but what i right I think some of the culture and some of the geography but what I will say is that a lot of people you meet. They're not like that at all.

38
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.090
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And I honestly I think that's probably just about anywhere you go.

39
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.500
Adam Frederick: Yep, exactly.

40
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.420
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah, yeah. So am I saying your name correct Frederick

41
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.620
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Frederick. Yeah.

42
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.310
Adam Frederick: Adam Frederick

43
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.140
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Frederick. Okay. Well, great, great. I'm going to minimize this and let's just make certain you can still see me. Can you still see me. I can still see you. Okay.

44
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.370
Adam Frederick: Perfect. Nothing.

45
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:21.060
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Nothing changed. Okay, Dan. Some go ahead and pull up a couple of things. So with the new patient intake. There are a lot of questions. So we take our time and we'd like to be very thorough to make certain that we understand

46
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.180
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: How you're doing and making certain that we can get the medicines that address your needs. Okay.

47
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:39.060
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: One of the things I always share with patients is just if anything happens and if you relapse. We don't want you to. But if you do, don't run from us run to us. Okay.

48
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:53.280
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Sometimes if things happen. People just kind of want to run away. No, pick up the phone and give us a call if I can see you soon, or if the therapist can see you soon. We do try to make certain that we're there for our patients. Okay, so

49
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.940
Adam Frederick: Any and

50
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.890
Adam Frederick: Then that's the whole reason why we're

51
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.080
Adam Frederick: Going to program. You know what I mean.

52
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:15.510
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Exactly. It's a virtual clinic. So any questions or concerns, start with that virtual clinic so that number that you dial before you came in. We have people call like care navigators some of our patients are nurses. We have physicians, we have providers so we

53
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.430
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Anytime you call the number. My understanding, someone will be available. And I'll double check on that. But yeah, so there's a way to do if you need to be able to reach me, they can reach me. Okay.

54
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:41.880
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Currently I see patients from one to nine, Monday through Friday my schedule will change a little bit. But that's pretty much the framework that I work in, and I do see patients on the weekend, especially for emergencies or anything like that. Okay.

55
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.760
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Okay. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and get this opened up for you.

56
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.750
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Because there's a format that we follow, just to make certain that we've got I's dotted and T's crossed

57
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:08.010
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It. Okay. Now, if at any point in time, Mr. Fred. If you have any questions as to, you know, why ask a question or you just have some concerns, don't hesitate to stop me and ask your questions. Okay.

Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Very safe medicine is you don't see people dying because they stopped breathing on the buprenorphine Suboxone okay but there's two

347
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:40.530
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Substances that can make your Suboxone unsafe and one is if you're drinking alcohol, especially high doses. And if you're doing those nerve peels that combination can be deadly. Because you could take a safe medicine and now becomes unsafe and you can stop breathing and die. Alright, so

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:52.950
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah, so, so we're gonna always revisit this. Um, so I do want to encourage smoking cessation. Sounds like you and your wife have small kids. And one thing that smoking does with people who smoking is that can shorten your life by 10 years to

467
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:54.540
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Write

468
00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:07.890
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: The good thing about when you stop smoking is that the benefits are there pretty immediate like within 20 to 30 minutes your blood pressure may go down to normal.

469
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:15.420
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Within 24 hours, your risk of a heart attack can decrease within a couple of days. I've even had patients tell me

470
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:24.510
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Where they stopped smoking for about a week or so they noticed that they their, their this male. The nurse at a nose is like must have gotten better because

471
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:33.060
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Now they can smell things they didn't. They couldn't smell before they can taste things that they weren't able to taste before food taste richer. Okay.

472
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:41.220
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: A couple of things patient says share it with me in terms of the benefits of smoking, they say, Look, I feel younger

473
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:55.110
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: It's like I can actually run and keep up with my kids I can go up the stairs and not feel like I had his elephant on my chest and so you may notice your exercise and Doris actually increases. So now the four year old is not all running you you know

474
00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:04.440
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: I've had patients basically share that but but medically you do notice that people that smoke it age issue.

475
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:13.710
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Oh risk of cancer arm and then the other thing it does to your white blood cells, which are your warrior cells, they don't work as well.

476
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:21.330
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: A lot of my people that start smoking they notice they don't get a sick as they used to get they didn't wasn't always catching every cold at walks by

477
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:23.370
Adam Frederick: I didn't know that.

478
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.380
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Yeah, and

479
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:37.770
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And it's not. These are not benefit. YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER TO GET and then it because when you're young, to your you are 37 so if you are to stop smoking. You can stop the ongoing damage to your lungs.

480
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:48.480
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: And a lot. Sometimes it's almost like some of the effects can be reversible to people. Can you know depending on when you stop, but we do know the longer you smoke, you're

481
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:59.340
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: limiting your life and the worst those lungs get most people say the reason they smoke is because of addiction. They want the nicotine, but they don't want the stuff that's causing cancer. Yeah.

482
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.720
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So you can't get the nicotine without getting all the stuff that causes cancer.

483
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:13.290
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: So the goal would be to wean you off the nicotine. Also, but they do have nicotine patches and nicotine products. So one of the things that patients do

484
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:21.900
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: They do the nicotine patch okay would prefer that you not smoke. If you have nicotine products. So it put the patch on 12 hours don't sleep with it.

485
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:30.990
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: On or you can have really bad dreams and if you crave a cigarette. They have the nicotine lozenges, and the nicotine gum. I recall. They even have an inhaler.

Adam Frederick: I tried the nicotine patch sorry to cut you off. I tried on it like every different kind and leave some kind of, I don't know why it does it. There's like

490
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.810
Adam Frederick: My skin must be too sensitive for it because it will burn a huge red mark around where it's at.

491
00:38:49.140 --> 00:39:04.140
Celedor  (Dr. Cel) Akintunde, MD: Right. It may, it's probably an allergy for you so that they have that option in some people like to Chantix but you, it looks like you have a primary care doctor. So if you could just make certain that you taught what your primary care doctor about that. Okay. Yeah.
