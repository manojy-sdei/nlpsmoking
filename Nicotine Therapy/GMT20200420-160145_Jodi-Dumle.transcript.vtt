1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
I'm aware of my

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.879
Holly Roddenbery: And what I'm wrestling.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.599
Holly Roddenbery: Maybe what needs to happen.

4
00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.790
Holly Roddenbery: By last our talk to you. I love

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.980
Holly Roddenbery: And

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.580
Holly Roddenbery: That continued and so

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.250
Holly Roddenbery: Saturday morning.

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.430
Holly Roddenbery: Friday morning thing of this past week.

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:51.810
Holly Roddenbery: And it was really hard because I was really wrestling with, am I allowing him to die by not doing anything and

10
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.370
Holly Roddenbery: I'm going to just kind of wrestling where those boundaries or

11
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.020
Holly Roddenbery: For

12
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760
Holly Roddenbery: What my responsibility is and

13
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.850
Holly Roddenbery: I refrained from having any interaction with him. I wished him. Well, every day, said my prayers forum.

14
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.500
Holly Roddenbery: But on, I think it was

15
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.430
Holly Roddenbery: Saturday. I can't remember if it was Friday or Saturday.

16
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
Holly Roddenbery: He reached out kid went out for a walk, and then said that

17
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:51.420
Holly Roddenbery: sent me a text message. Assuming that I was like watching where he was going, since we had each other on find our friends and said, I, I didn't. I wasn't there, but I didn't go in and he was talking about a liquor store and said that he was really sick and knew what that meant.

18
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.460
Holly Roddenbery: That he was to the point where he couldn't drink anymore.

19
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.370
Holly Roddenbery: Because it was causing liver and stomach problems and that's unfortunate that that can

20
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:19.920
Holly Roddenbery: Hurt him like it dies. And I also know that a watch, and have seizures and balanced and if I hadn't been there. Then he very well would have lost his life and

21
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:39.900
Holly Roddenbery: And that's given the PTSD for him drinking is giving me PTSD for his withdrawals. So during those the time of him going through withdrawals whenever I experience the most intense anxiety.

22
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.960
Holly Roddenbery: And my

23
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.150
Holly Roddenbery: Fear of him having a seizure and worry or him.

24
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.420
Holly Roddenbery: cause me to be

25
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.780
Holly Roddenbery: Overly compassionate.

26
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.650
Holly Roddenbery: For me, I went up and took care of them and we tried to do my best to

27
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.020
Holly Roddenbery: Treat him.

28
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.810
Holly Roddenbery: So that he didn't take a get well and not have a seizure, and I stayed with him that night because I know

29
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.970
Holly Roddenbery: That I've watched him.

30
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:38.730
Holly Roddenbery: Fall asleep and I know his brain patterns, try to work themselves out during that time. And I watched him wake up and have a seizure. So I felt like it would be safe for me to stay up there and that next morning I woke up and I felt myself.

31
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.330
Holly Roddenbery: Repeating a pattern of

32
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:54.480
Holly Roddenbery: Going back to normal since he was getting back to normal. And I don't know that should be repeat

33
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:10.560
Holly Roddenbery: Like, there has to be a change in yes he does grow every time and learn new things every time and repair it and make concessions and try to do something different.

34
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.170
Holly Roddenbery: And

35
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:34.800
Holly Roddenbery: I just know the fight that it takes and I know that there has to be a significant realization, whatever they say in the first step where you realize that you're no longer in control and he does, he did realize that

36
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.080
Holly Roddenbery: And has been thinking on what he needs to do.

37
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.940
Holly Roddenbery: And

38
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.310
Holly Roddenbery: Yesterday being Sunday we have kind of a day of rest together and went for a walk and grilled out in the backyard and put some food.

39
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.110
Holly Roddenbery: And just trying to nourish and not too well being.

40
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.910
Holly Roddenbery: But she's still suffering from physical ailments.

41
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.400
Holly Roddenbery: But we did

42
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:24.960
Holly Roddenbery: We didn't want rain from being part that fasting from our relationship isn't so much in place. Get might need to be

43
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.400
Thinking

44
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.030
Holly Roddenbery: Is I'm still downstairs I did stay the night last night up there.

45
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.220
Holly Roddenbery: But I don't haven't mentioned moving

46
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.660
Holly Roddenbery: In until I know that A is able to

47
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.810
Holly Roddenbery: Demonstrate

48
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.610
Change.

49
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:08.070
Holly Roddenbery: And I've talked. I talked with them about, you know, the tools that I talked to them about that weren't real life experience and I do feel like I'm about the on warns he has

50
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.510
Holly Roddenbery: Enough to not arena and allow himself to receive

51
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.200
Holly Roddenbery: Advice and words and

52
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.770
Holly Roddenbery: Not felt like I don't want this, and I want to

53
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.610
Holly Roddenbery: Open to

54
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.950
Holly Roddenbery: Hearing my story and things that I've learned and wisdom on that.

55
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:46.380
Holly Roddenbery: But I don't know that is for the sake with him warning the relationship or if it's because he wants to help himself.

56
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.550
Holly Roddenbery: And I'm having to come to a place where

57
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.220
Holly Roddenbery: I want him to have the help for himself more than I want us to have the relationship

58
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.970
Holly Roddenbery: Sorry, I couldn't hear what you're saying.

59
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.080
Jodi Dumler: It's, it's not you. My kid is asked me how to turn the TV on. I told her.

60
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.020
Jodi Dumler: I viewed it so I you're hearing her knocking ask

61
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.170
Holly Roddenbery: Um,

62
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:31.200
Holly Roddenbery: But yeah, that book that I mentioned that I was reading boundaries has been really where I've

63
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.420
Holly Roddenbery: Gotten my nourishing

64
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.820
Holly Roddenbery: knowledge and understanding of how to handle this.

65
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:52.170
Holly Roddenbery: And my readings this morning really spoke to me in that it was talking about. Not that I shouldn't continue to set myself up for hurt or disappointed.

66
00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:10.440
Holly Roddenbery: And that I should wait until it is safe and real patterns of change have been demonstrated before I go back and that many people are quick to trust in the name of forgiveness and not make sure that the other is producing

67
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.160
Holly Roddenbery: Fruit in keeping with repentance.

68
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:33.540
Holly Roddenbery: And then just reminded me that it's foolish to open myself up or to continue to open myself up and lock emotionally to an abusive or addicted person without seeing true change and forgive but guard my heart until I see sustained change.

69
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:43.530
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, definitely. Sounds like you know what you're trying to do. And so being able to stay with that.

70
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.920
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

71
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:59.730
Holly Roddenbery: There's been so many times that this has occurred. And I'm not saying like every weekend. Like I moved up here in July.

72
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.150
Holly Roddenbery: So it hasn't been a four year

73
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:14.100
Holly Roddenbery: But since July peace rapidly grown and made changes positive changes inside

74
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:38.850
Holly Roddenbery: Know these situations have happened before I do struggle with the wisdom and most because I do see change and growth and and I do believe in our relationship and makes it

75
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.200
Holly Roddenbery: Hey,

76
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.290
Holly Roddenbery: Can you

77
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.660
Holly Roddenbery: Hear me and see me better now.

78
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:52.380
Jodi Dumler: Yes, everything you said it was like it slow. And then I tried to like catch it all self up so I caught very little of like the last two minutes.

79
00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:02.280
Holly Roddenbery: On okay sorry yeah I walked into the other room and I think I have worst service over there. I'm closer to my router here.

80
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:12.810
Holly Roddenbery: By. Yeah, I was just named I guess the most important part was just what I've been reading that book and

81
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.730
Holly Roddenbery: Understanding how to navigate this

82
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.450
Jodi Dumler: And

83
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.710
protect myself.

84
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:35.550
Holly Roddenbery: And not you know continually set myself up for harm or disappointment, but be supportive, because I do know that I had been a tool or

85
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.000
Holly Roddenbery: Resource for her.

86
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.530
Holly Roddenbery: To help

87
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.180
You

88
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.190
Jodi Dumler: Do

89
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.740
Jodi Dumler: Are you okay with me giving you one tip that I would recommend

90
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.940
Holly Roddenbery: Sure.

91
00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:07.140
Jodi Dumler: I think the biggest thing that just in listening that I think I want to make sure that you you make at least try and encourage in him or allow is just that he seeks out others besides you because you're such a

92
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.930
Jodi Dumler: Okay, easy for you to be the main support.

93
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.030
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, that's what I talked to him about yesterday actually

94
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:23.760
Holly Roddenbery: Was that while I want to be here for you. And I love helping in being here and

95
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.280
Holly Roddenbery: I know that

96
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.400
Holly Roddenbery: My I guess my

97
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.100
Holly Roddenbery: Connection with him as a partner.

98
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:53.730
Holly Roddenbery: Maybe I guess complicated in this arena. And I think that it would be good for her to seek out help by himself apart from me. It's pretty much that too and

99
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.930
Holly Roddenbery: He understood

100
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:07.560
Holly Roddenbery: And I did that, I know that I'm bias, right, trying to medication might provide some relief for some help.

101
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:08.910
Jodi Dumler: Yeah.

102
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.420
Holly Roddenbery: He mentioned Xanax before bed and I was like,

103
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.780
Holly Roddenbery: Be careful about

104
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.600
Holly Roddenbery: Placing the addictive behavior in a different direction.

105
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.340
Holly Roddenbery: That is easy to do that, but not deal with the root.

106
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.630
Holly Roddenbery: By dealing with a ruler. That's what I've been talking

107
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.610
Holly Roddenbery: More about

108
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.270
Holly Roddenbery: And you know guarding your mind.

109
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:50.370
Holly Roddenbery: Active actively listening to your own thoughts and kicking, point taken them captive kicking them out.

110
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.100
Holly Roddenbery: It's a thought that's going to lead you askew, we're off the right path.

111
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.450
Holly Roddenbery: But

112
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.070
Holly Roddenbery: I don't know, I just, I know that I have to

113
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.380
Holly Roddenbery: Focus on myself.

114
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:29.520
Holly Roddenbery: But not in a way that I'm swinging too far to the other side and not being compassionate because I'm going to get that he's going to be sensitive to that because that's going to feel like rejection. This time, I know this all too well was have been through it.

115
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.320
Holly Roddenbery: And

116
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.140
Holly Roddenbery: That's the

117
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.510
Holly Roddenbery: Challenge. We know each other. We're very

118
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:41.700
Holly Roddenbery: Stubborn

119
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:55.500
Jodi Dumler: So what do you want think, what are you hoping the next week looks like in terms of you and boundaries and just you know how much time you do or don't spend with him and really thinking

120
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.220
Holly Roddenbery: I want to be intentional about

121
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:11.310
Holly Roddenbery: Spending time with him because I in the past have been not very intentional about that and I'll allow my work life to

122
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.880
Holly Roddenbery: Take over and

123
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:21.600
Holly Roddenbery: You know won't take a break to go for a walk or I won't take the break to cook dinner, sit down for dinner.

124
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:33.630
Holly Roddenbery: I just end up, I guess, trying to bypass the struggles in our relationship get three work.

125
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:51.510
Holly Roddenbery: And right now I'm behind on work because of worrying and emotion. And so I want to be making sure that I'm getting that work done, but also maintaining a balance and trying to have a health healthier relationship with him.

126
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.240
Jodi Dumler: It sounds like you've decided you really do.

127
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.110
Jodi Dumler: Intend to try and keep this relationship through this just

128
00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:17.130
Jodi Dumler: Living in different settings. So it may not be a constant were together all the time. But it sounds like you've decided you want to maintain the relationship itself because you're actively putting time into it.

129
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.150
Yeah.

130
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:26.310
Holly Roddenbery: I think that I want to stay down here more though, as far as staying the night

131
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.010
Holly Roddenbery: That's going to be where the challenges.

132
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:43.620
Jodi Dumler: Have you when you and him have talked about this how I would have you told him on why you decided you know what you're doing. I guess what you guys are doing.

133
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:54.810
Holly Roddenbery: Well, I've had my belongings. The majority of them down here for two months now.

134
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:08.040
Holly Roddenbery: And it's been a slow increase of me getting this downstairs stuff which to him can look like a project that I'm very own to but I've

135
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:25.740
Holly Roddenbery: spoken to him about it that I have intentions are running this homeowner get paid in and told him that I think especially during this time of corn to that having the additional space will be helpful.

136
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.780
Holly Roddenbery: And that I do feel my heart that we need to

137
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.910
Holly Roddenbery: Take time away from each other.

138
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.390
Holly Roddenbery: To work through

139
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.770
Holly Roddenbery: Our own course no issues and how we treat and respect each other and

140
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.050
That

141
00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:04.500
Holly Roddenbery: I think that this needs to be, I don't know when they'll be into it, but I know that we both need to clean house.

142
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:14.760
Holly Roddenbery: And I've been very open about not wanting to have a relationship if

143
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:27.270
Holly Roddenbery: If the drinking doesn't come to an end, because he knows that his life is on the line that

144
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:36.750
Holly Roddenbery: He's been aware of that and I made it clear in terms of anger that

145
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.750
Holly Roddenbery: There is no relationship there is no future, and this is

146
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.070
Holly Roddenbery: It's the drinking doesn't come to an end.

147
00:19:51.930 --> 00:20:00.360
Holly Roddenbery: By think that I need to make that clear that I still feel like that. And now I want to see him.

148
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.850
Holly Roddenbery: reaching out for help.

149
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:12.750
So,

150
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:20.010
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, I think being able to articulate that in a one word good in a calm manner is definitely

151
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.970
Jodi Dumler: That can hopefully be heard.

152
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.790
Jodi Dumler: Isn't an emotional reaction. This is something you've thought about

153
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.340
Holly Roddenbery: Last night as

154
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:50.400
Holly Roddenbery: As we're getting ready for bed talking about how we both slave drive ourselves and part of living a healthy, balanced life and sobriety is taking the time that you need for yourself. So let's

155
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.520
Holly Roddenbery: Say some intelligent person gets it, it's just

156
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.410
Holly Roddenbery: We both have to do the work.

157
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.550
Holly Roddenbery: drop my headphones there.

158
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.540
Jodi Dumler: I'm wondering, I mean you can you can shoot this idea

159
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.980
Jodi Dumler: I'm throwing it out there. Anyway, um,

160
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.460
Jodi Dumler: I think because I think you're in such a

161
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:38.550
Jodi Dumler: difficult situation in terms of closeness and you know like you started still there. It's like it's a really it's a difficult maneuvering relationship situation where you by yourself.

162
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:49.590
Jodi Dumler: And so if you can. I really think being able to be extremely structured and like intentional time, like you said, like, Okay, I'm gonna

163
00:21:50.010 --> 00:22:03.420
Jodi Dumler: Do meals with, you know, I'm going to have this time, and I do meals and if he wants to be there will be there if he's not, he's not, you know, and we're, you know, these are the times. I'm giving it we're gonna, I'm gonna go on a walk and he's invited and like very intentional, because otherwise.

164
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.620
Jodi Dumler: You're going to be separate, but you're not. And then it's going to feel like, did we really separate I did we really yeah

165
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.480
Holly Roddenbery: I totally get that. And that's why I

166
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.440
Holly Roddenbery: Think that's what I've realized

167
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.570
Holly Roddenbery: That I do have to bring the intention and as

168
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:41.940
Jodi Dumler: You said I mean sound like you're trying to make stuff and you're trying to say I want to try this. I want to you know make sure we're doing what we need and I and like we just said you know you don't want to into in two weeks to a month, be like, did I really do.

169
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.560
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

170
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.230
Jodi Dumler: You don't want to continue it you know

171
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:52.410
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, I told him last week that we really did need to

172
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.340
Holly Roddenbery: Break our paths, like break up or take a break.

173
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.000
Holly Roddenbery: Because of the need for

174
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:24.990
Holly Roddenbery: Time for ourselves and during that time, I, I had a lot of time to myself, but it was aggravated by the worry and anxiety. Is he alive. Is he going to work through this, should I be doing something and so

175
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.590
Holly Roddenbery: I think it would be good for us to

176
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:30.840
Take

177
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.630
Holly Roddenbery: Intentional time to gather and actually see that through

178
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:58.290
Holly Roddenbery: But I know that during this time that he probably feels pretty troubled and worried about our relationship. So I also want to give him some security that I'm not just trying to get away from him that I'm really trying to make a space for our relationship to exist in a healthy place.

179
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.950
Holly Roddenbery: So I think

180
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:11.130
Holly Roddenbery: Expressing that right time and place will be something that I do as well. Yeah.

181
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.890
Jodi Dumler: You guys can almost look at it like

182
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.740
Jodi Dumler: pick back up and a dating capacity, where you times you know where it's like you do and you're not living together.

183
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.670
Jodi Dumler: And so it doesn't have to be a bad thing. You guys just get more intentional time but

184
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.760
Jodi Dumler: You know, you guys can kind of figure out how that looks.

185
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.320
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, that came to life.

186
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.190
Jodi Dumler: That doesn't sound scary.

187
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.780
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah. Yes. Yes. I think that that is

188
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:53.850
Holly Roddenbery: Is too true. Well, I just, and I know I just believe the universe's on our side this, but I do know that they will need some

189
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.250
Holly Roddenbery: Some help you today tools.

190
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.840
Holly Roddenbery: To be able to

191
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.280
Holly Roddenbery: Do better, so to say this.

192
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.850
Jodi Dumler: Do you feel like he's

193
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:12.330
Jodi Dumler: In a place where he's getting ready to seek other support besides just you.

194
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.320
Holly Roddenbery: I don't know.

195
00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.490
Holly Roddenbery: I hope

196
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.640
Holly Roddenbery: I think that he has a lot to catch up on right now and

197
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.800
Holly Roddenbery: I hope that that's one of the things that he does during this time of catching up.

198
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.170
Jodi Dumler: Because

199
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:48.210
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, last week, pretty much just didn't exist forum may as 60 emails per day because of this position, the college

200
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:57.600
Holly Roddenbery: I think that that right now is this first priority, even before himself.

201
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.120
Holly Roddenbery: So I guess time will tell. What that

202
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:06.690
Jodi Dumler: Yeah.

203
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.250
Holly Roddenbery: I never knew

204
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:17.640
Holly Roddenbery: How much this therapy with you all would end up doing for me, which you guys this group has been around for me during

205
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.190
Jodi Dumler: So it's just nice to just have something like, you know,

206
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.870
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

207
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:38.490
Holly Roddenbery: I think that that has been probably one of the biggest helps to us is, I feel like he tried to keep a secret. I know about that. And he led me into that.

208
00:26:39.570 --> 00:27:00.660
Holly Roddenbery: And I respected that for a long time. And then so far. I didn't speak up. But once I realized it was affecting me and I couldn't handle it. I had to open up, it became our problem at that point and and as I've opened up that we've gained how

209
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.630
Holly Roddenbery: And

210
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:12.870
Holly Roddenbery: Also there was, you know, he was forced out and awful about it with the trips to the hospital after seizure.

211
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.770
Holly Roddenbery: Being open with physicians about this.

212
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:26.430
Holly Roddenbery: Is insurance now is health insurance. He has a nurse who calls me about that and talks to them about co prevention.

213
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.990
Holly Roddenbery: And making sure his life is set up for

214
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:46.920
Holly Roddenbery: The possibility of that. And I think that that's kind of a rude awakening forum, especially after I researched and found out that alcoholism can lead to

215
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:55.290
Holly Roddenbery: Seizure is that happen even when you haven't been drinking. They're not going through withdrawals.

216
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.160
Yeah.

217
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.810
Holly Roddenbery: I've only read that one source but

218
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.680
Jodi Dumler: Some people get those

219
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.400
Jodi Dumler: Days yeah I

220
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.910
Jodi Dumler: Can't remember what they're called, but. Mm hmm. Yeah. That is

221
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.170
Holly Roddenbery: This pretty much an alcohol induced, what is it called,

222
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.970
Holly Roddenbery: Epilepsy.

223
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.960
Holly Roddenbery: And I don't want to see that happen.

224
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:34.860
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, I felt like you're giving him as much support as you can and should

225
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:44.520
Jodi Dumler: Because I think I look at it like anything in a relationship, you need both of you in a relationship need outside help for anything.

226
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.860
Jodi Dumler: Especially if you were to, you know, let's say you stay in this relationship. You guys are together for years.

227
00:28:50.400 --> 00:29:03.120
Jodi Dumler: You know if he does have a relapse. You know, so he's great for years and he has a relapse, it's gonna be hard to tell you because you're his, you know, significant other. He's not going to want to hurt you, it upset you. And so he really needs those outside supports to

228
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.410
Jodi Dumler: encourage him to

229
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.550
Jodi Dumler: Do what he needs to do. And so, you know, because it's really hard to tell that person that you

230
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.500
Jodi Dumler: Live with in London. Yeah.

231
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.110
Jodi Dumler: He needs those

232
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.330
Holly Roddenbery: I think that will be looking for, for sure.

233
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.460
Jodi Dumler: Mm hmm. Yeah.

234
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.450
Holly Roddenbery: I've watched and

235
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.600
Holly Roddenbery: Do go for a drink and seeing how it's taking effect on

236
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.580
Holly Roddenbery: How he treats me because he knows I'm up against now.

237
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.800
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, and

238
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.110
Holly Roddenbery: Past couple

239
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.370
Holly Roddenbery: Is taking the wrong path and just coaching job.

240
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.150
Jodi Dumler: Yeah.

241
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.010
Jodi Dumler: Now,

242
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.520
Holly Roddenbery: That help would be beneficial way.

243
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.910
Holly Roddenbery: No matter where things go the only choice that I have is to

244
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.440
Holly Roddenbery: Name, it's really going to be

245
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.010
Holly Roddenbery: Up to her.

246
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:15.750
Holly Roddenbery: Either

247
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.300
Jodi Dumler: It's okay once in a while. It's really slow and I lose you. And then you're back. Okay.

248
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.690
Jodi Dumler: Some of it I think I got most of it.

249
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:41.040
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, and I, as you know, as he's going through this and if Ps and you are desiring to assist you know I'm sure there's a zillion programs where you are, that he could go to

250
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:48.360
Jodi Dumler: If he's nervous how people finding out. I don't know what other options there are virtually bright heart does do alcohol treatment.

251
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.710
Jodi Dumler: But the group isn't going to be as you know it's I got that quite as good because most people

252
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:01.140
Jodi Dumler: Are using our, you know, our are getting location for Suboxone

253
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.160
Jodi Dumler: But the other counselor that you're not seeing

254
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:13.080
Jodi Dumler: could probably do. I know I have a patient that I see, just for alcohol and I would assume she could do the same.

255
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.170
Holly Roddenbery: Did they do medications like the alcohol.

256
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.990
Holly Roddenbery: That like helps with your

257
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:31.980
Jodi Dumler: No, I don't know what is still prescribed. I don't know if in Michigan, a change. I knew in Kansas. They just continued the medication that we use to get your people for cravings.

258
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:37.680
Holly Roddenbery: I have a friend that I speak with and her boyfriend is on a medication.

259
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.670
Jodi Dumler: So you guys must

260
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.950
Do it.

261
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:53.130
Jodi Dumler: You must still have it open in Michigan and any physician can do it technically I suppose a bright heart doctor cut the most of them just to me it

262
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.390
Jodi Dumler: So I would probably just if he has a physician. He's coming.

263
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.780
Yeah.

264
00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:06.900
Jodi Dumler: That route and then do counseling through whoever he feels comfortable. I'm just thinking he probably didn't want people to know whose job and all that.

265
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.410
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah yeah

266
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.490
Jodi Dumler: Finding the ring.

267
00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.110
Holly Roddenbery: Oh, yeah.

268
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.200
Jodi Dumler: No secure with people that he's not going to like, you know,

269
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.330
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, that was just

270
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:27.930
Holly Roddenbery: Curious questions, I realized that he has to be the one that reaches out to find that hope and to get set that's something he can do and that is that's on him.

271
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:34.110
Jodi Dumler: I mentioned, because I knew I thought he probably had some concerns and I don't know what all the options are. So I just let you know I

272
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.270
Jodi Dumler: Think that Rochelle could probably do.

273
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:43.560
Jodi Dumler: Videos video one on one. If he, at some point, once it. I mean, he probably get put in the group as well just

274
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:53.490
Jodi Dumler: Because I've had, like I said, I've had a couple of patients once in a while, we have some that are struggling with alcohol, alcoholism, not jumping that are part of group. It just depends. So

275
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.030
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

276
00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:03.930
Jodi Dumler: If he doesn't find one. He likes or is nervous or, you know, kind of thing. Yeah, throwing it out there. Since I'm sure he'll ask you at some point, possibly

277
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.670
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, great.

278
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:15.450
Jodi Dumler: Advice but okay. So from my perspective as your counselor. My biggest thing I think right now is just, I really want you to be

279
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:23.460
Jodi Dumler: Straightforward with me on what you want your boundaries to look like because I want to check in with you on a week and see if you're maintaining them.

280
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.270
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

281
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.470
Jodi Dumler: You know, so I want to know what what are you really hoping in this next week.

282
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.940
Jodi Dumler: That you see I need to do with him or with an with me and

283
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:40.320
Holly Roddenbery: I want to spend at least three nights of next week in my bed down here.

284
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.270
Holly Roddenbery: Okay, and

285
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:43.770
Holly Roddenbery: I

286
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:58.710
Holly Roddenbery: Hope that in being intentional with time apart and time together. I hope that happens, and I hope that we're able to

287
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.070
