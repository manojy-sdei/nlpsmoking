15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
Dominique Pozo: And I'm going to be typing as we do this actually need to lower my computer. So I can type

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.830
Dominique Pozo: I'll be typing as we do it so that

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.200
Dominique Pozo: Just so you know.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.140
Dominique Pozo: I'll be looking down, looking like I'm doing something, but I'm totally with you. I'm just doing this so

19
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.870
Okay.

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:44.130
Dominique Pozo: Alright, so would you tell me a little bit about what brought you to the program, what led up to this point that you decided to, you know, come into recovery.

21
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.870
Heather Pepin: Okay, so, from about 2008 to 2016 17

22
00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:12.630
Heather Pepin: I was using opiates. I had had a foot surgery and it just led me to keep wanting to do them and I, we just got really bad. I was doing like 15 or 20 pills a day for those years. Um, I caught. I got arrested in 2016 for chuck in charge and possession

23
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.030
Heather Pepin: And then in 2017 of September. I got sentenced to nine years to DLC.

24
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.320
Dominique Pozo: Hold on, wait, can you, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to keep up typing.

25
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640
Dominique Pozo: That's okay i'm i'm like hearing it all, but I can't keep up with a title.

26
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.970
Heather Pepin: So,

27
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.120
Dominique Pozo: Did you say in 2015 you were arrested. The first time 2016 16 okay

28
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.180
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

29
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.010
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And then, and then, when was the next one.

30
00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:00.900
Heather Pepin: In September 2017 I was sentenced to nine years DLC with five years suspended. So I did. I supposed to do, for I did two and a half with good time.

Heather Pepin: I was raised was released October 2 of

32
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.380
Heather Pepin: And then I was put on parole for two years and probation for five

33
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.700
Dominique Pozo: So you're still in probation.

34
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.180
Heather Pepin: Yeah. Um, yeah, I only been out six months.

35
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.630
Heather Pepin: Seven almost seven months, oh seven months actually. Yeah, seven. Um, so

36
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.140
Heather Pepin: It's kind of hard getting out starting all over

37
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.100
Yeah.

38
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.350
Dominique Pozo: Yep permission.

39
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.050
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

40
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.190
Heather Pepin: And I have cravings. So my friend told me about the program.

41
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.450
Heather Pepin: So I thought I tried to see if it helps me

42
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.540
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

43
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.310
Dominique Pozo: And

44
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.940
Dominique Pozo: What was it like, were you using when you were incarcerated or

45
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.950
Heather Pepin: I did some smarts. It was the first time I had ever heard of it. Was it is it of course

46
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.620
Heather Pepin: I did it here and there. Yes.

47
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.500
Dominique Pozo: Okay, um,

48
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.370
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and before before you were arrested and

49
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:47.220
Dominique Pozo: And then sentence. Had you tried any recovery programs or programs. No. No. Okay.

50
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.050
Dominique Pozo: So this is the first one.

51
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.950
Heather Pepin: Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.760
Okay.

53
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.940
Heather Pepin: I go through counseling. I am HR as well.

54
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.330
Heather Pepin: And I do groups then through them and also

55
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.330
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. Like an IoT program or something.

56
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.040
Heather Pepin: I LP, it's just

57
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:24.540
Heather Pepin: A month CCP is what they call it through the floor probation. So it's, I was doing three groups, a week and then one one on one, but I'm down to one one group, a week. I only have two groups left to finish my six month program.

58
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.280
Dominique Pozo: Oh, great. Okay.

59
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.390
Dominique Pozo: But I'm hoping

60
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.530
Heather Pepin: That's going to

61
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.560
Heather Pepin: Help me to continue in my recovery.

62
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.630
Dominique Pozo: And, um, what have you found supportive from these groups.

63
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:51.180
Heather Pepin: I'm just, it kind of keeps me busy and then carried other people that relate to us, they kind of know exactly what we experienced. So that's been good to know that I'm not alone.

64
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.680
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

65
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:20.940
Dominique Pozo: I was typing and i i have to switch screen as I'm typing, but I, I, I thought I heard your voice cracked a little is that bringing up

66
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.350
Dominique Pozo: Is it bringing up the motion for you or am I miss hearing. Yeah.

67
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.430
Dominique Pozo: So I'm now I'm not looking at what I'm typing. I'm looking at you on the screen. What I'm what what's coming up.

68
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.200
Heather Pepin: It's just hard.

69
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.580
Heather Pepin: I just don't want to mess up again.

70
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.750
Heather Pepin: And it's hard. No. Well, I live with my brother. He's very supportive, but

71
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.040
Heather Pepin: He's never done anything in his life. So it's kind of hard to talk to him because he doesn't know exactly what I

72
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.920
Dominique Pozo: can't relate as others who've been through it and yeah

73
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.020
Heather Pepin: So it's kind of hard.

74
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

75
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.360
Heather Pepin: So there's it, I'm doing good. So

76
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.130
Heather Pepin: Sorry.

77
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:19.860
Dominique Pozo: Oh, please. This is a. So I'm going to switch back. I'm just going to save this. Because if I don't save it. It deletes everything I tight and

78
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:31.080
Dominique Pozo: It's fine. So this is what I do. I'm a therapist I I sit with people through difficult times. And I have a therapist to and I'm

79
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.900
Dominique Pozo: Often in tears crying with my therapist, so

80
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:41.700
Dominique Pozo: Please, I, I mean as you wish. If you want to stop the tears, that's fine. And I just want you to know there's so welcome and

81
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.980
Dominique Pozo: Thank you. Yeah.

82
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:55.770
Dominique Pozo: I mean, it sounds like you've been through a lot, you know, and you're just freshly out of prison. There's a lot to read and there's a lot to the reintegration process and

83
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:04.920
Dominique Pozo: You know, I don't know how your experience was through all this but I imagine there's been some trauma along the way it's traumatizing to be locked up.

84
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.140
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

85
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:17.640
Heather Pepin: I mean, that was the first time I had ever been in trouble. Ever. My first risk ever in my life. So like that wasn't something that I ever want to do again.

86
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

87
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.170
Heather Pepin: I'm just trying to go about it the right way.

88
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:37.530
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like you are. It sounds like you're following the program that you you were asked to be participate in and getting the support with the groups and your individual therapy and your you've got a job. It sounds like

89
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:45.600
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Yeah, sounds like you're doing everything and I i think i just want to normalize what you're going through that, you know, it's

90
00:08:47.520 --> 00:09:00.450
Dominique Pozo: It's it's well i i i know it's shocking for the system to be locked for your personal body emotional system to be locked up, and then to come back out after going through that as another shock. Yeah.

91
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.230
Yeah.

92
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:16.470
Dominique Pozo: Let's, um, let's take a moment and just take a few deep breaths. So part of working with trauma and building that resilience inside, again, is to, you know, start to self regulate

93
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:29.070
Dominique Pozo: More frequently. And that's an easy way to do that as their deep breath work. So let's just if you want to keep your eyes open and just lightly focus on something in front of you just taking a few deep breaths.

94
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:41.670
Dominique Pozo: And just feeling whatever you're sitting on whatever has your back. If you're leaning up against something just feeling that support.

95
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:59.070
Dominique Pozo: And really acknowledging you know what you've moved through and where you're at now. And, you know, here you are living with your brother, you're, you're working you're showing up for your recovery.

96
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:10.470
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I want to thank you for coming, half the folks that I make sessions with often don't show up. So I'm going to just say thank you for coming.

97
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.600
Heather Pepin: Thank you for being here.

98
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.410
Yeah.

99
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, just let's let's take a moment, rub your hands together.

100
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:33.210
Dominique Pozo: And if you just want to place them anywhere that feels like you could use a little soothing. So like for me right now. I feel my heart space in my low belly.

101
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:49.380
Dominique Pozo: You know, so whatever part of your body, you know, it could be a cheek can be your shoulder whatever wherever it feels good to just make some contact and and let yourself know like, Hey, I'm right here. I'm here, I'm listening.

102
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.740
Dominique Pozo: To, you know, the part that's maybe scared and having a hard time

103
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.820
Dominique Pozo: Then before we carry on and move on. Just imagine

104
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:21.150
Dominique Pozo: Some place in your life that is a safe a safe place. A good place, a place where you can relax and enjoy.

105
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:37.740
Dominique Pozo: And surrender. You know, you can like let yourself just be to have a place like that. And it could be a memory. It could be from when you were little, or maybe somewhere you went last week, whatever at somewhere that feels. That's a good good feelings come up

106
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.040
Heather Pepin: Over here at all. I'd rather just talk

107
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.520
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Well, that is amazing. That's so great that your actual home is a safe sanctuary.

108
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.710
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Okay.

109
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.010
Dominique Pozo: So just for a moment, just let it in, you know, letting in the reality that you're actually

110
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.610
Dominique Pozo: You're in a good place right now physically

111
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.040
Dominique Pozo: Does it, does this feel like a good time to keep maybe going over some historical stuff.

112
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.000
Heather Pepin: Yes. No.

113
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:21.870
Okay.

114
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.850
Dominique Pozo: I'm

115
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.380
Dominique Pozo: Okay, how about children. Do you have any children.

116
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.290
Heather Pepin: Yes, my lap three boys. Okay.

117
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.370
Dominique Pozo: And where do they live.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.380
Dominique Pozo: And how would you say your relationship with them is

123
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.980
Heather Pepin: I'm building it back. Yeah.

124
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.290
Dominique Pozo: Do you think that's going, how is that going

125
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.420
Heather Pepin: It's going well. Uh huh.

126

Okay.

127
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.440
Heather Pepin: Boy, at first it was hard.

128
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:26.640
But

129
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.960
Heather Pepin: She really didn't let me see them at first when I got home and I didn't have no contact all the time, I was like to

174
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.680

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.620
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

178
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.620
Dominique Pozo: Well, that sounds, that sounds like another layer of pain that your relationship with your mom was impacted so deeply

179
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.210
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yeah.

180
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.980

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.120
Oh,

182
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.080
Heather Pepin: I mean, she has my boys, so

183
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:22.380
Heather Pepin: Like when I first started going to see them like she wouldn't say anything to me but I these past few weeks, like we've been talking a lot more. She's been asking, I'm doing because we're so like we're building it up. But, step by step, it's gonna take a lot

184
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.390
Yeah yeah

185
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.480
Dominique Pozo: About your father. What, what was your relationship like with your father.

186
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.230
Heather Pepin: When I was younger, he was in prison.

187
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.700
Heather Pepin: He's been out since I was like

188
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.930
Heather Pepin: The team. He's been out since but

189
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.090
Heather Pepin: We had a drug addiction.

190
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.850
Heather Pepin: Doesn't anymore. But he did for 30 something years

191
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.500
Dominique Pozo: What was he using

192
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.150
Methamphetamines

193
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.970
Heather Pepin: But we are close now he was there for me the whole time I was locked up and

194
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.620
Heather Pepin: I go see him quite often. And I talked to him daily

195
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.030
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

196
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.260
Dominique Pozo: So he sounds like he's a great support for, you know,

197
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.120
Heather Pepin: He is now. Yes.

198
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.150
Heather Pepin: He was really the only one that was there for me. I was locked up so

199
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.110
Dominique Pozo: Wow.

200
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.540
Heather Pepin: I didn't talk to anybody else in my family, but

201
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:58.560
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's interesting. I imagine that, you know, since he went through such similar things you guys could actually relate and what a gift that you have somebody to connect with that's family.

202
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:10.620
Dominique Pozo: I imagine to that probably stirs up a lot for your mom, you know, that maybe that's where some of the kind of just cutting you off, it probably hit a really deep chord.

203
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.350
Heather Pepin: Right yeah cuz I was

204
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.690

205
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:23.670

263
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:55.170
Dominique Pozo: So let's see. Let's think of some short term goals. So I'm thinking, let's see, we're in May, June, July, by the end of July. Can you think of like five short term goals that are, you know, realistic that you think you can really show up for for yourself.

264
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.860
Heather Pepin: I'm hoping demo face.

265
00:26:59.400 --> 00:26:59.760
Okay.

266
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:14.130
Heather Pepin: I want to try to be able to have my kids stay with me for like a night yourself working on that.

267
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.590
Heather Pepin: Just staying sober.

268
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:37.620
Heather Pepin: I finished my counseling next week through me char. So I just want to be able to continue this one is, and I had a question is group every week.

269
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.080
Heather Pepin: Yes. Okay. At the same time,

270
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.510
Heather Pepin: Yes. Okay, I just wanted to make sure

271
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.170
Yep.

272
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:57.720
Dominique Pozo: And then we can talk about our schedule. But, you know, you're welcome to see me weekly or every other week, whatever, whatever, however much support you need.

273
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.650
Heather Pepin: Okay.

274
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.530
Dominique Pozo: If you're counting is going to end there for sure.

275
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:07.320
Dominique Pozo: Look, yes. Make sure that you're seeing that we're at least seen each other every other week. And if you want it every week. That's great.

276
00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.160
Okay.

277
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.250
Heather Pepin: Let's see.

278
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:16.980
Heather Pepin: Really no

279
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:36.900
Heather Pepin: Was it really just my main goals. I want to try it out of a conversation with my mom, sit down, actually talk to her.

280
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.740
Heather Pepin: I've been trying to what I just have it and I need to. I just keep putting it off.

281
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.190
Dominique Pozo: But that sounds like a good idea to me.

282
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.340
Heather Pepin: Yeah.

283
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:09.750
Dominique Pozo: That could be something I can kind of work on and prepare you for before you do it and we get really clear on unless you're already clear and you know what you want to say and

284
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.330
Dominique Pozo: What's that

285
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.530
Heather Pepin: I don't yet.

286
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.970
Dominique Pozo: Okay, okay.

287
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.860
Dominique Pozo: So that could be that, that sounds to me like a definite focus of

288
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:36.330
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, just maybe going through, like all the parts that are maybe scary to address or painful and and really, you know, we can role play, you can practice it with me and kind of warm yourself up to do that before you actually do it. It helps a lot.

289
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:37.470
Heather Pepin: Thanks.

290
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:38.220
Uh huh.

291
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.270
Dominique Pozo: One more. Do you feel good.

292
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.300
Heather Pepin: I feel okay with those with should oh

293
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.550
Dominique Pozo: That sounds good. That's a lot. It's

294
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.030
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

295
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.050
Dominique Pozo: That's enough.

296
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.400
Heather Pepin: I think you should

297
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:11.760
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

298
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.140
Okay, right.

299
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:22.020
Dominique Pozo: Now, what, what about a one long term goal, what would be a long term goal that you might have for yourself.

300
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.170
Heather Pepin: Having my kids activate custody.

301
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.010
Okay.

302
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.550
Dominique Pozo: All right.

303
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:47.490
Dominique Pozo: So this is part of the relapse prevention just kind of getting some clarity and naming it. Are you aware of any particular things that trigger you emotionally

304
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.170
Heather Pepin: Oh,

305
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.280

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.470
Heather Pepin: Okay. Oh.
