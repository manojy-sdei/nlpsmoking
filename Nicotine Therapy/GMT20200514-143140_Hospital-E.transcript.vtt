Elias Gallegos: Just, just remember that vividly is this crazy

71
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:45.360
Dawn Abriel: I bet that yeah i mean i'm i'm i'm surprised. I mean, this is the beauty of being young, there's so much resilience. There's so much that we get, we can

72
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.030
Dawn Abriel: Compensate for

73
00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:15.270
Dawn Abriel: I'm just glad you're doing this now. Well, well, your body can recover at some really smart of you and I saw that you've been in multiple other treatment programs, was there anything about any of the treatment programs that really worked for you any of them were pieces of it stuck.

74
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:24.990
Elias Gallegos: Oh yeah, there was a there was one rehab that I went to, is like called men's recovery in Los Lunas and now and kind of stuck with me because they

75
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.100
Dawn Abriel: Yes, I've heard did that.

76
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:34.470
Elias Gallegos: Yeah, I mean, it wasn't really like a good program because it was just like a lot of like people that didn't want to be there all stuck together.

77
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:43.440
Elias Gallegos: But like one good part about the program was said there was a gym, there, and there was like a workout gym and we had like weights, I guess they closed down.

78
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.940
Elias Gallegos: One of the facilities in New Mexico, and he just moved all the way to be there and it was cool, because like we had like

79
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:59.280
Elias Gallegos: I mean, there was no guidance those new direction, but I had a couple good friends there that actually like taught me how to work out and stuff. And that really stuck with me.

80
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:10.050
Elias Gallegos: It was kind of just like peers, like my peers kind of helps me realize that drugs weren't really like all that life is about, you know,

81
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.860
Elias Gallegos: But still, like, I've still been adding

82
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.450
Dawn Abriel: Like, I really do.

83
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.770
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and

84
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:37.530
Dawn Abriel: I have noticed in my work that I have done a lot of reading been to a lot of conferences and really schooled myself on addiction, so I can offer

85
00:08:38.550 --> 00:09:04.470
Dawn Abriel: Intellectual information. But when people get together in groups. It's the members talking to each other that makes the most difference mean you can hang your hat on some of the intellectual facts that I can offer, but what really changes lives is you guys talking to each other.

86
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.320
Elias Gallegos: Yeah.

87
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.640

88
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:29.340
Elias Gallegos: Yeah, I am taking will be training for my anxiety and it's kind of helping like some mornings I forget to take it like this morning, I kind of forgot to take it, but I took it as soon as I remembered and it's like

89
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.910
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

90
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:43.890
Elias Gallegos: If I don't take it. I just stay in bed. But as soon as I take it. I like wake up and then I start moving around and it helps me move like a start getting focused, but it's just like if I don't take it. I just, I could sleep all day, pretty much.

91
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.950

Dawn Abriel: I want you to get your pulse and you do that by

306
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:21.510
Dawn Abriel: You have a muscle on the side of your neck that goes from your job down to your neck right in front of it. If you take your right hand and feel your left side. Yeah, you're a little too high. Yeah right in there. If you gently press like

307
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.190

Dawn Abriel: All right.

326
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:54.810
Dawn Abriel: And

327
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.730
Dawn Abriel: Pull the cap or go back just a little bit and let me see you swallow.

328
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.400
Dawn Abriel: Great. Put your ear to your shoulder both sides.

329
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.220
Dawn Abriel: Okay and chin. The shoulder both sides.

330
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.140
Dawn Abriel: And your head back and head forward.

331
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.320
Dawn Abriel: Take a big deep breath.

332
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:22.440
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

333
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:32.190
Dawn Abriel: And push on your belly with the other hand. Upper right upper left lower right lower left no pain or bumps or lumps or anything abnormal in there.

334
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:33.090
No.

335
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.710
Dawn Abriel: And bring the camera down. Let me see your ankles.

336
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.840
Dawn Abriel: Great. Okay. Then prop the camera up somewhere.

337
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.540
Dawn Abriel: And let me see you pull pull against your fingers.

338
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.100
Dawn Abriel: Great no pain or discomfort when you do that.

339
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.060
Dawn Abriel: Well, and then lastly, let me see you tap your fingers to your thumb.

340
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.300
Dawn Abriel: Perfect. Okay, now let's talk about the program.

341
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.440
Will go

342
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:39.150
Dawn Abriel: In group, it has to be very much like this with good lighting. You have to be seated. You have to be stable in somewhere where you you're not wandering around and

343
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:48.660
Dawn Abriel: With the good lighting and the most important thing is that under no conditions can there be anyone walking behind you.

344
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:58.530
Dawn Abriel: Okay, because if someone accidentally saw someone may new on your screen, it would be a big violation of privacy. Right.

345
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:07.770
Dawn Abriel: So if we ever see someone behind you. We will kick you out of the group will kick you out of zoom

346
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:17.190
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And when you come to zoom the group and you've been there for an hour, then the doctor will write your medicine for that week.

347
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.060
Dawn Abriel: So if you have to miss group.

348
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.200
Dawn Abriel: And you know, we know that life happens but

349
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:34.200
Dawn Abriel: You have to go to the virtual clinic and say, you know, my mother's sick, I'm in the hospital or whatever it is, but

350
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:43.530
Dawn Abriel: You know if that goes on for more than two or three times in a row, then we have to discharge you and you have to start all over. Coming back in

351
00:32:44.490 --> 00:33:09.180
Dawn Abriel: But for the most part, I can write for your scripts, if, if you have to miss an appointment we ask that you don't, because this is the therapy. The group work is the medicine. The buprenorphine is what allows you to be confident and calm enough to be in group to get the real treatment right

352
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:10.170
Right.

353
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:20.400
Dawn Abriel: Because you're not having to be out on the street hustling and whatever. So in all of the programs you've been in. Have you ever been on buprenorphine.

354
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.800
Dawn Abriel: No. Okay.

355
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.320
Dawn Abriel: So we don't really know.

356
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.810
Dawn Abriel: How much to give you about how much heroin. Were you doing per day.

357
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:47.490
Elias Gallegos: I was doing about like a half guy like a half gram habit half gram to, like, yeah, I have ground we get me through the day. And if I got less than that, then I would just keep

358
00:33:48.570 --> 00:34:00.150
Elias Gallegos: Keep keep hustling till I made enough to until I did enough, pretty much. It wasn't really like it was pretty much me just smoking into like I got enough

359
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:15.900
Elias Gallegos: To the point where I would stop my anxiety would go away the pain go away and I would be able to just be content and then some days I would push it beyond the but most of the time is around half graph.

360
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.700
Okay.

361
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:24.090
Dawn Abriel: So because we don't know how much buprenorphine. You're going to need

362
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.270
Dawn Abriel: You and I are going to have to check in.

363
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.560
Dawn Abriel: Like this weekend so

364
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:42.600
Dawn Abriel: It takes about two to three days for the for you to get enough buprenorphine in your system for us to know how

365
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.080
Dawn Abriel: So here's the thing.

366
00:34:47.220 --> 00:35:08.100
Dawn Abriel: You have made receptors, right, the opioid has to get into the cells and it does it by matching the receptor, but when you take heroin, your body creates many more receptors, and that's what tolerance. That's why you need more and more to get the same effect.

367
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.600
Dawn Abriel: So we don't know how many receptors, you have

368
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.690
Dawn Abriel: So with the buprenorphine.

369
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:34.530
Dawn Abriel: What we're trying to do is cover you know block it in, get those receptors with buprenorphine on them instead of the heroin. See, because it's empty receptors that trigger withdrawal symptoms and the cravings.

370
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:56.310
Dawn Abriel: Yes. So if we get enough buprenorphine on board you the cravings decrease and the withdrawal symptoms decrease. So let's start with eight milligrams it but the way I want you to do it. Just that one time just today want you to go and cut it in half the little strip

371
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.770
Dawn Abriel: And take four milligrams

372
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:00.690
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

373
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:15.960
Dawn Abriel: And wait an hour and see how you do. If you have no withdrawal symptoms didn't just wait if by eight o'clock tonight you start having some withdrawal, take the other four milligrams

374
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:40.710
Dawn Abriel: And then tomorrow, take the full eight because the idea is this medicine is really, really long acting, it stays in your system between 48 and 72 hours. There are some countries that dose this. Every third day some. Yeah, it really stays in your system, a long time so

375
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.430
Dawn Abriel: So you want. You really want to take it only once a day.

376
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.850
Dawn Abriel: And you do that by putting it under your tongue, you can take a sip of water.

377
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:08.340
Dawn Abriel: And then put it under your tongue. It has to sit there for at least two minutes because it's the blood vessels underneath your tongue that absorb the medicine.

378
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:31.440
Dawn Abriel: And you cannot smoke before taking your sub your buprenorphine. If you do, because you know the tobacco. One of the ways it does damage all over your body is to cramp down your blood vessels, that's what causes the stroke and the heart attack and the kidney disease is the cramping down

379
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:42.600
Dawn Abriel: But you're trying to make those blood vessels under your tongue, taking the medicine, but if they're all cramped down from the smoking, you don't get all the medicine.

380
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.980
Dawn Abriel: So don't smoke before taking your film.

381
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.800
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

382
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.510
Dawn Abriel: I give

383
00:37:52.530 --> 00:38:08.580
Dawn Abriel: E prescriptions electronic you'll never get a piece of paper with the prescription on it. So you gave the care coordinators, the name and address of the pharmacy and I will submit that in just a couple of minutes.

384
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.600
Elias Gallegos: Okay. The Walgreens on cemetery.

385
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:23.700
Dawn Abriel: If that's what you told them. That's where it'll go if you ever need to change pharmacies. You go to the virtual clinic and you tell them to change.

386
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:33.870
Dawn Abriel: The pharmacy, you want to use and do that before group. If you don't do it before group. I don't know that you want a different pharmacy and it's

387
00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.180
Dawn Abriel: It's a lot harder to change it that way by telling me.

388
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.190
Dawn Abriel: Once a month you'll get one of these in the mail.

389
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:48.840
A

390
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.090
Dawn Abriel: manila envelope. When you get it in the mail. Do not open it.

391
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.030
Dawn Abriel: If you open it, they won't use it.

392
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:05.280
Dawn Abriel: If you get it get it in the mail, you go to the virtual clinic and you say to the care coordinators, I have one of these. What do I do

393
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.650
Dawn Abriel: You'll open it in front of them, you'll take this out, you'll open this in front of them.

394
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:17.490
Dawn Abriel: And you'll go to the bathroom that you will not take your phone with you because we do not need to see you pee into the cup.

395
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:27.990
Dawn Abriel: You bring the cup back and you'll hold the cup up to the camera and you'll turn it very slowly. They'll read the results.

396
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:45.780
Dawn Abriel: The important thing here is if you change your address. You have to make sure bright heart health gets your address, because if you if you don't get this in the mail once a month, you have to go to a lab and get the get your

397
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.060
Dawn Abriel: urine drug screen.

398
00:39:50.070 --> 00:40:00.690
Dawn Abriel: So make sure they've got the correct address if you ever don't. So you're going to go to the lab in the next couple of days to get urine and blood

399
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.330
Dawn Abriel: For baseline labs.

400
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.390
Dawn Abriel: So this month is covered, you won't get one of those in the mail until in June.

401
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.690
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

402
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:28.140
Dawn Abriel: After weird. I'm also sending you some Narcan by law. If I order a narcotic and buprenorphine is a long acting opioids. It's a narcotic.

403
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:44.100
Dawn Abriel: And I have to order Narcan so you can pick it up have there's 11 refills use them you know it's it's people in your situation, who really save the most number of lives by having Narcan around

404
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:54.300
Elias Gallegos: Yeah, I've actually I've actually given. So I went to an MDC I went to an art class because they had this program where like

405
00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:06.150
Elias Gallegos: A these doctors came in and they said that, like if someone's overdosing and you feel like you could help them. You should know how to give people Narcan so like when I got when I got released from there.

406
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:14.850
Elias Gallegos: They gave me some Narcan and I actually ended up saving somebody on the street with the Narcan like a couple times.

407
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:22.920
Elias Gallegos: And it was actually it was it was a good feeling. And it was kind of cool that like inside the jail that they like the doctors came in and let us

408
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:32.280
Elias Gallegos: Are basically gave us Narcan to save someone's life and then like with all those people falling out on heroin is kind of is actually really good feeling.

409
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.600
Elias Gallegos: Yeah, because

410
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:40.680
Elias Gallegos: Because if an ambulance will come. By the time the endless was the comb, they would have already been like, you know,

411
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.510
Dawn Abriel: They would have stopped breathing and and wouldn't have been able to get him back.

412
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:58.260
Elias Gallegos: Yeah, and it was just a good feeling to know that, like, I have no can in my backpack and I you know someone's overdosing, you know, be like, I could save him right now. You know, it was reasonable.

413
00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.280
Yeah.

414
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.380
Dawn Abriel: So, you know, Elias with with your life experience.

415
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:13.050
Dawn Abriel: You, you just would be such the perfect person to be a pure drug counselor.

416
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:20.490
Elias Gallegos: That's what I've been wanting to do, actually, especially since like I've been an addict for so long. Like, I understand.

417
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:20.790
Yeah.

418
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.170
Dawn Abriel: You do you understand it much better than I ever will.

419
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:37.110
Dawn Abriel: So I'm glad you're here. I think you'll do really well in this program. If you had any problems or any questions.

420
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:48.690
Dawn Abriel: You go to the virtual clinic and you talk to the care coordinators. That's their job they're hired to solve your problems and

421
00:42:49.530 --> 00:43:09.930
Dawn Abriel: We have had a huge increase in the number of people asking for our services because of the pandemic. So we've had to train a bunch of new care coordinators and they are not all up to speed. But if you're patient and you're you're stubborn, you'll get the care you need

422
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:11.400
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

423
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:22.680
Dawn Abriel: So your group is going to be Tuesdays at noon, you have to go to the virtual clinic at least a half an hour beforehand to do

424
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:23.850
Dawn Abriel: A couple of things.

425
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.740
Elias Gallegos: You have to fill out.

426
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.590
Dawn Abriel: One of the surveys every week.

427
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.350
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

428
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.290
Dawn Abriel: That's survey is called the bam ba.

429
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.120
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

430
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.450
Dawn Abriel: Brief addiction monitor

431
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:51.060
Dawn Abriel: So when we're done here with when you're done with me here. You're going to go back to the virtual clinic and you're going to ask the coordinator for three things.

432
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.890
Dawn Abriel: Oh no, you're going to already go to the lab for two things, ask them, How do I do a Bam.

433
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:14.070
Dawn Abriel: Get. Get familiar and easy with that and how do I do the ACE AC e adverse childhood experiences. I want to see what your early childhood traumas were be

434
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.550
Dawn Abriel: And that's just one time 10 questions one time and you're done.

435

438
00:44:44.190 --> 00:45:03.570
Dawn Abriel: Right, because sometimes you'll get processed really fast and they'll give you, because the zoom room number changes every week. It's a different number every week to get into group. That way we can make sure people do their surveys and have their urine drug screens and all of that done.

439
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:05.340
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

456
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.360
Dawn Abriel: And I'll just ask you how long the medicines lasting you

457
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:37.890
Dawn Abriel: If you're having any problems, you know, you're taking too much buprenorphine. If you get sleepy drowsiness means you've got too much of the medicine on board.

458
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:48.300
Dawn Abriel: I doubt that's going to happen given your long history of how many receptors, you've created on yourself so far, but just just see, you know,

459
00:46:48.600 --> 00:47:02.790
Dawn Abriel: So you're going to take for wait an hour. So if you're feeling fine. Great. If by the evening time you're starting to get some more withdrawal symptoms, take the other four milligrams and the next day you'll take how much

460
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:14.190
Elias Gallegos: I will take four and then if it's too much still. Then I take two and if it's two lists and I still take them out that started that day with prayer.

461
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:28.050
Dawn Abriel: Right, so the total you'll. The next morning you'll take the total of eight. If you go four plus four. Then the next morning you'll take eight and then every day in the morning, you will only take eight

462
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.150
Dawn Abriel: OK. OK.

463
00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:41.670
Dawn Abriel: So for now, I'm going to write for I'm going to write for one film every day, till Saturday and

464
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:52.140
Dawn Abriel: But it's not going to have all that complicated instruction on the bottle right you're going to do the what we've talked about not what it says on the bottle.

465
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.630
Elias Gallegos: Okay, okay.

466
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.140
Dawn Abriel: Do you have any questions.

467
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.380
Elias Gallegos: Um, you are. Yeah.

468
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:13.800
Elias Gallegos: After this, after I do the check in with the virtual clinic for the for to learn about the band and everything. How, when do I go pick up my prescription

469
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:22.710
Dawn Abriel: Well, it'll take about 1520 minutes for me to finish your chart here and to order it.

470
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.660
Okay, so

471
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:35.040
Dawn Abriel: What I recommend is that you call and say, Is my E prescription in

472
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.460
Dawn Abriel: And I, you know, I'm ready to come pick it up.

473
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:52.950
Dawn Abriel: And I recommend that everyone have the pharmacy tech the person that you know they're just about to hand you the package you need to say to them, please count them in front of me.

474
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.160
Dawn Abriel: So I'm going to send you Civ Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I'm going to send you for

475
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.880
Dawn Abriel: Four films, so

476
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:15.870
Dawn Abriel: If you touch the package, they won't, they won't take it back if they've missed counted. If someone stole it back in the pharmacy, they won't give you

477
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:25.560
Dawn Abriel: Once you touch the package, they won't change anything about it. If you just hold your hands and you say, please. Count the number in front of me.

478
00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:46.710
Dawn Abriel: And if you want to blame me. If you want to say, I know this is stupid, but my doctor just is going to give me a hard time if I don't do this. This is to protect you. Because if they short you there is nothing I can do. There is nothing I can do. I can't write for more

479
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.970
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

480
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.460
Dawn Abriel: The insurance won't cover it that

481
00:49:51.510 --> 00:50:04.590
Dawn Abriel: The pharmacy won't do anything about it really. There's nothing we can do. And you end up being a short but if you make them count it in front of you, then that is solved.

482
00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.840
Dawn Abriel: And then they don't like it. I gotta tell you the pharmacies don't like it.

483
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.110
Dawn Abriel: So that's why I say blame it on me.

484
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:15.270
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

485
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:19.260
Elias Gallegos: All right.

486
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.800
Elias Gallegos: Well, no, I'm not okay with just throwing you under the bus, I'd be like, okay, I understand.

487
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.740
Dawn Abriel: I don't care that that you know it's all about patient safety patient

488
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:44.370
Dawn Abriel: Protection, I will tell you that it's awfully important to keep them in a safe place if you if you have a locked place that's even better.

489
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:59.160
Dawn Abriel: You don't have children around but people come in, they know you're on Suboxone they want to steal your medicine and sell it. So, don't tell people you're on Suboxone don't tell them you have it in your home.

490
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.760
Elias Gallegos: Alright.

491
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.340
Dawn Abriel: And

492
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:21.930
Dawn Abriel: Make sure so once you get stable like probably June, maybe the end of June, you will start tapering tiny little bits, you'll be cutting off of one of your strips.

493
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:36.210
Dawn Abriel: And so when you go to the pharmacy buy a contact lens container because you're going to put tiny little pieces into those contact lens storage.

494
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:38.340
Dawn Abriel: Places.

495
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:40.590
Elias Gallegos: Okay.

496
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:43.350
Dawn Abriel: All right. Anything else

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.960
Elias Gallegos: See you Saturday morning. Have a good day.
