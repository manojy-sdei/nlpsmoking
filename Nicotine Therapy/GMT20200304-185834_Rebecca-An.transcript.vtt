00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.490
Dawn Ninham: Yesterday I got up and he did the whole, you know, dig up early to point out for a walk. It kills me. Other harassment.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.900
Dawn Ninham: Data almost all the whole day not just thinking that

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.580
Dawn Ninham: Much but then my dogs run away. Can I do them for the walk on the back road.

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:46.980
Dawn Ninham: My dogs like 330 they ran away or they got out. I didn't know. And then they're like, half hour and then I would look for him could want them anywhere. So they finally came back around 930 last night, I was so scared I was almost crying.

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.450

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.140
Dawn Ninham: Well, I actually, um, but, so this morning I plan on do the same thing. Getting up early, but I think from maybe being overwhelmed because they were gone. I was scared.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.660
Dawn Ninham: Always tend dating it

21
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:56.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. That's all right. You know, you're getting on your, your training your body and your mind to get on a different system. And so it's going to take some time to be able to do it consistently but you just got to kind of stay at it, you know.

22
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.590
Dawn Ninham: How are you feeling that Monday.

23
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.610
Dawn Ninham: But I was gone. Searching for the dogs, then what he had all back together and tried starting it and it didn't start. So now I'm going to have to

44
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.190
Dawn Ninham: Way we raise our hand side, it wasn't one spot that we were covering I figured that second time I go tonight.

Dawn Ninham: Yeah. He'll probably do 30 for Riley, is he had left no welfare took away or just binges or whatever, put on hold. So he got pulled over. But I don't know how you got in trouble. Anyway, he took, he took the fine in 60 days Dale, rather than a probation and just ongoing thing.

62
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.420
Dawn Ninham: It doesn't work. So that could work so

63
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.160
Dawn Ninham: He says,

64
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.460
Dawn Ninham: He needs to go check in the arrangement cited else. I'm like, Oh my goodness. So I wouldn't talk to my worker on Monday.

65
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.420
Dawn Ninham: As well. So we're going to know one good thing. And there's two things because one you want to pay for testing.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Away already

74
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.500
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

75
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a lot of money.

76
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.150
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

77
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.050
Dawn Ninham: It for the next two weeks then he'll get his next check and put a note on you know the $200 away.

78
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.340
Dawn Ninham: From the beginning gallop. So honestly, but $180 for me just

79
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.330
Dawn Ninham: Okay.

80
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know my either my internet or your Internets kind of going in and out.

81
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.760
Dawn Ninham: I put it on data.

82
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.380
Dawn Ninham: So I wouldn't get to the last drop

83
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Better

84
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.800
Yeah.

85
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're going to go back to the meeting tonight and

86
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Raise your hand and ask about getting a sponsor.

87
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.000
Yeah.

88
00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. And, you know, listen to what they say about any kind of workbook studies.

89
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because

90
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.500
Dawn Ninham: Just today book.

91
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, you asked for, just for today.

92
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.220
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, just for today book, please head on her to give me one.

93
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good.

94
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.070
Yeah.

95
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, it just for today is daily meditation, where you open it up first thing in the morning you read the daily meditation, let it absorb in

96
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And sometimes you'll, you'll feel like it's directly talking to you, and other times you know you won't, but it definitely puts in that positive affirmation inside your head that you need, first thing in the morning, you know, to be able to face your day.

97
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

98
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A workbook study is where you get the NA workbook and you meet with a bunch of other women. You want to women's workbooks study group is what you want to look for look for

99
00:07:53.340 --> 00:08:01.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you get a sponsor tonight, then she'll the hopefully be able to kind of guide you in that right direction, but that's really working.

100
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In my opinion, it's really working the steps in a very thorough manner.

101
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:21.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I think that you'll get the most out of it. The workbooks amazing because it breaks it all down into sections, you know, and you read it and then you answer the question, you know, as honestly as you possibly can and you know you don't

102
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't, other than your study group. You don't have to share that with anybody, but your sponsor you know that's

103
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Personal for you.

104
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it really kind of dives in in depth and helps you kind of clean out the closet and deal with, you know, stuff and see life in a whole different manner, you know,

105
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.110
Dawn Ninham: Good at that

106
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:55.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really good. You're doing an amazing job. JOHN I want you to know that, you know, showing up and being present and being active and being willing to put yourself out there.

107
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:03.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And go to meetings, you know, I know that it's tough. In the beginning, but I'm telling you keep doing it and you'll be so glad that you did.

108
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.620
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

109
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.100
You know,

110
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did you get it.

111
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you put in a piece of paper in the basket to get your to get signed showing that you went to that meeting.

112
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.220
Dawn Ninham: Yep. Me and him did, yeah.

113
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:28.110
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, I asked the girl next to me when I just happened to see Europe to visit and I will just use little girl, but she was that any group. I was like, whoa, I was like, Are you following me.

114
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's like, no.

115
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:38.040
Dawn Ninham: Like, I think I am as a dump all be wrong, but these are laughing. And then I asked her for what I heard a little paper so everyone

116
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good.

117
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you get, you know, week of meetings and how many times a week. Are you planning on going.

118
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.590
Dawn Ninham: There, we're okay with me going to any groups like three times a week, but I'm trying to go five but now the van broke. I'm going to try to get the three, no matter what. And then

119
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.290
Dawn Ninham: And I already have a ride for

120
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.650
Dawn Ninham: Any other day Monday, Tuesday, he could take me and then

121
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.910
Dawn Ninham: I just kind of have one more day I was thinking I'm or that like days. I don't see the kids would be a good day to go

122
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:15.630
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, because the kids keep us, but so na so every day, I'll be good. You know, everybody will be a day.

123
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and

124
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:28.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once you start forming those relationships in there. It's like you'll look forward to going. You know what I mean. You'll feel comfortable in there when you go and it'll be

125
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you'll build this over support system around you and people that you can call in recovery that when you're struggling

126
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what a sponsors for too so that you can call her anytime that you need a lot of sponsors, say, I want you to call me.

127
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:56.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once a day for the first 30 days. And so what they do is they put the responsibility on you to be able to make that contact once a day. Call the sponsor check in. Let them know how you're doing.

128
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:05.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really kind of helping you build these better habits to be able to reach out, you know, when you're struggling so that makes sense.

129
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.020
Yeah.

130
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.330
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

131
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:22.650
Dawn Ninham: I'm 110%, like you said, hundred 10% the next four months, but two months. Most definitely. You know, I mean, to keep things going to change like to see if there are still fall fixed, you know, I mean,

132
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.440
Dawn Ninham: I gotta know I got sure if I dive in, 10% if I'm not, you know, I mean I got another that's gonna say month told him to come on

133
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:41.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah and you do the next right thing and you're you're pushing forward, you always get proof of the things that you're doing like like having each meeting sign for

134
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean when you have to go back to court generally your sponsor possibly should be able to go in there with you as you know a support, but also as a confirmation that you're doing the work, and that you you're actively engaged in a program

135
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which will you know definitely help you know on your side.

136
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's something that you can talk to the person that you get for a sponsor, but

137
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That was definitely the first step you are well on your way.

138
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:14.850
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

139
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:22.500
Dawn Ninham: Again, but I'm going to do, I'm going to successfully complete that and didn't know how to do. Last time I just asked the wrong people. Yes.

140
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And if you, you know, again, attention, pay attention to what they say, pay attention to how long they have

141
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In recovery, pay attention to how their life changed, you know, are they working. Are they stable and do they have a sponsor because when you get a sponsor you don't just get that sponsor you get grand sponsors and you get sponsors, he

162
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:35.250
Dawn Ninham: I might believe I did pre camp with I remember saying to the outside of the store, you know, all, all done, I'll see if you go

163
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the middle

164
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.680
Dawn Ninham: East all the junk food, but outside. So that's how I'm gonna try eating healthy

165
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, even if you just implement, you know, different

166
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fruits and vegetables within your daily

167
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.980
Dawn Ninham: Apple the peanut butter.

168
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need to. I love apples with Fernando is better, you know,

169
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.400
Yeah.

170
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm a banana for that.

171
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.990
Dawn Ninham: This week to I did that sort of the chocolate about the apples and peanut butter.

172
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. And what about your water intake.

173
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.420
Dawn Ninham: And that's why I wouldn't got a jug of water because we only drink like bottled water.

174
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.260
Fresh water night.

175
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:27.870
Dawn Ninham: So I'm going to go get a couple of gallons instead of just one, but I always drink coffee in the morning, usually ice water during the day, but I don't like I don't really take a lot of juice or soda. I don't like soda, you know,

176
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.020
Dawn Ninham: You can't get your water you

177
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:38.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. So, though, you get those two on track and you'll, you know, they're always going to be a work in progress and you're always

178
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:52.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not always going to be able to veer towards a healthy food because you'll have cravings for that chocolate and it's okay if you give yourself permission to have chocolate once a week or whatever. But you don't want to stay in that. You know what I mean. Yeah.

179
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:59.490
Dawn Ninham: I already have ankle like to into two days or three get to three days and I haven't eight apples a peanut butter and

180
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.290
Dawn Ninham: Jelly what vitamins that wouldn't got vitamins from the morning, the ones one today.

181
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:14.730
Dawn Ninham: Oh, good. Yeah. And I just don't walk yes rate I have ankles today like amazingly usually they're all pumped up and swallow and I think angels today.

182
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yay, see it's already you can already feel the difference. Right. Yeah.

183
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:29.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there'll be times when doing what's good and healthy for you will feel hard and you won't want to do it, do it anyway. It's like

184
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:30.870
Dawn Ninham: Yeah.

185
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, some sometimes, you know, kind of think about it in terms of, you know, there are mornings when we when our kids get up in the morning and we don't want to move right but we do it anyway, right, because they need to be taken.

186
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:44.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Care of

187
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you think of that when you're having those struggles to eating stuff healthy

188
00:16:49.980 --> 00:17:05.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Think of it that way. This has to be done. My kids are going to benefit. My body is going to benefit. It has to be done. And so you get to that, you know, solid thought process and it kind of views you away from wanting to do something different, you know,

189
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.600
Dawn Ninham: Yeah. Cuz there's less last week I've noticed

190
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:24.990
Dawn Ninham: We're always usually making spaghetti or pizza or something like really like tacos or we're always making something like really rich and but this week. I tried something different and I brought the apples of peanut butter, of course, and then I got

191
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:30.270
Dawn Ninham: Wheat crackers and wheat bread. I like the way that

192
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:49.050
Dawn Ninham: He's made chili mac instead of, instead of spaghetti, spaghetti is really that they don't be diabetic. So it's really bad for you. It's really not going to eat like a quarter cup of sauce and maybe a third cup of noodles and that's all you like 30 grams of carbs.

193
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.610
Dawn Ninham: Couldn't believe it.

194
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's a lot just to

195
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.950
Dawn Ninham: Try to follow that. Yeah, I'm going to try and follow the like how you see when I was starting to fill up

196
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.590
Dawn Ninham: The 1510 grams of carbs.

197
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.090
Dawn Ninham: 1530 at night.

198
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good, good. And you're getting enough sleep right

199
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:21.570
Dawn Ninham: Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. I told him I said I sleep six hours, you know, that's or six, or maybe even six and a half, because then once I get up. If I just make myself get up, I'll feel way better. Like I did yesterday.

200
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:35.280
Dawn Ninham: So good. I am five and a half hours sleep for six hours sleep, and I felt good. I got up, I just kept going, you know, in my. It was awesome until like later on in the gym and I lost my dogs and I laid down but didn't go sleep.

201
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.120
Dawn Ninham: Late there. I thought, man, are they ever going to come back to town, Adam, or somebody had him. I thought because I

202
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:52.770
Dawn Ninham: I was on Facebook and I touched that is that if no matter what. Even if your kids aren't around you always have your dog. Yes. So I click the like button and also my dogs are visiting. I was like, somebody had them.

206
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.680
Dawn Ninham: Yeah, that's good.

207
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.910

If you see if you

214
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:13.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To people that are doing it you know that don't engage in the gossip and that are not half measuring their recovery, but really putting everything for you know you want somebody like minded on where you're at.
