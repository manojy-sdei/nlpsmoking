Dr. Belis Aladag: And let me get to know you a little bit. Let's, um, let's chat about what's been going on with you. Um, what substances, you're needing help with what happened all that

11
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.110
moRganic: Okay, um, the substance is je je HP, which is the gamma, gamma

12
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.330
moRganic: Yeah. Are you familiar with it.

13
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, geez.

14
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.910
moRganic: Yeah.

15
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.710
moRganic: I, you know,

16
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a sedative

17
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:36.240
moRganic: Yes, I use it 24 seven around the clock every three hours for the past year and a half, when I stopped. I get extreme withdraws to the point of delirium my chest hurts really bad and in July.

18
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.460
moRganic: I went five days without it. And like I said, I was in delirium and I ended up diagnosed with two pulmonary embolisms

19
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: For me, oh

20
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:58.680
moRganic: Yeah, from the hypertension or whatever goes on during that. Yeah. So there's no other reason why I would have pulmonary embolisms, at my age, man. I had no other

21
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Problems.

22
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.650
Right.

23
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you've been doing this. How long have you been doing this gap.

24
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.810
moRganic: For a year and a half, straight

25
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:20.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Years. Wow. Okay. And prior to that were you using any drugs like did you start with like marijuana or alcohol or

26
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.080
moRganic: Meth yeah

27
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so. Were you smoking them us

28
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Okay. So you were smoking meth. When did us. How old were you when you started that

29
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.290
moRganic: Probably about 15

30
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.100
Your

31
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: And with the math for you taking GH be occasionally or that didn't that start happening to later.

32
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.130
moRganic: That didn't start happening till later.

33
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so from age on your smoking meth, are you doing it all the time or

34
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.890
moRganic: Yes, daily

35
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:04.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Daily. Okay. Did you ever, like, go into rehab or go into some sort of, you know, have any sober time since then.

36
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:14.940
moRganic: I yes i got clean because I got a CPS case with my son. And so I was clean for a few months I was going to strategies for change.

37
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.440
moRganic: Okay. And I don't know if you're familiar with that. But it's a

38
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.290
moRganic: Watch a drug class to get my son back. So I was clean for a while and then I lost him because they started drinking alcohol.

39
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.720
moRganic: And my mom has some now. But then that's when I started using method and then picked up on GH be

40
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.280
Okay. OK.

41
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK, when you when you resume. Two months after that you started the gap, then

42
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.800
moRganic: Yes.

43
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: And how, when was that one one. Did you lose this battle the case with your son like what year

44
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.330
moRganic: And two

45
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Years.

46
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Two years ago.

47
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah okay sorry to cut you off, you were gonna say 2018 or so.

48
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:17.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, OK. OK, I see, I see. So that's what's been going on. Um, and I see the CPS case. So your mom has your son. Do you have any other kids.

49
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.970
moRganic: Yeah, my, I have two daughters one to 12 and the other one to 10

50
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.990
moRganic: But my mom has them as well. But she LEGALLY, LEGALLY had my son from adoption.

51
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see.

52
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.790
moRganic: It as my rights to my mom for my daughters, so

53
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. And your son is how old now.

54
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.500
moRganic: And he will be five in August.

55
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:51.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you have a 12 year old a 10 year old and a five year old. Great. Okay. And they're all with your Mom, are you close to your mom. I mean, you get to see them and you

56
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.490
moRganic: Know, not really. Now she won't let me see him. Not until I'm sober.

57
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:10.620
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, so you're, you want to get help. Okay, so. So when did so. Then the last year and a half. Did you stop the meth. After a while, and it's just GH T or like what what's been going on.

58
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.010
moRganic: No, I haven't stopped him this at all. So I do both, which I've been doing a lot of research on it and it's really bad to do both because one

59
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.700
moRganic: Is the central nervous system system depressant, and the other one's a stimulant. So I'm just, I'm really messed myself up.

60
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:40.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, agree you know i think it's it's really dangerous and. And actually, you know, stopping. If you're taking gap so much like you're saying like every three hours all day.

61
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:55.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just suddenly stopping it can be deadly. So it's not a good idea to stop just stop you know it's it's because it's a like you had said it's an inhibitor of the nervous system. It's a tranquilizer.

62
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:10.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: So just like benzo like you don't, we don't want you to go into a seizure state. That's what would happen if you just suddenly stop in those five days in July, remember you said you've got delirious and stuff that was a dangerous time

63
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so my advice is in the future. Like, not that you planning on doing but just

64
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:31.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Remember that you need medical help. So if you decide like I just can't take it anymore. Like, I don't know what to do, then, you know, check yourself into a hospital and tell them that you've been on GH be all the time that way they know they got to treat you for seizure prevention.

65
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.160
moRganic: Okay.

66
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.550
moRganic: I've been. I've been to the emergency room. I don't know if you can look it up or anything, but I've been to the emergency room probably literally like 30 times

67
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.480
moRganic: From which was out here in Sacramento and. None of them. None of them even knew what I was talking about.

68
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: The fold them up ggv

69
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.560
Yes.

70
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.240
moRganic: So,

71
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.570
moRganic: I'm

72
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: That's what I'm

73
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Going

74
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:12.360
moRganic: To my primary care doctor, I just met him, he told me, because I know somebody who had to be sedated for three days to get off of it. But, but he told me because of my medical insurance that they'll probably just turn me away.

75
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.890
moRganic: So,

76
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:25.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well, here's the deal. So, so let's get to that. So now it's like okay so now we're in this situation, how do we get you out. It's how do we detox you off of gap.

77
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:36.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: And math, the math pieces, easy, you just stop it and you sleep it off and you know how it is. You get depressed and whatever. But you just kind of it just wears off. Right.

78
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:50.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right gap is a different story. It's medically necessary for you to be medicated so so you remember, you just said, yeah, the person has to be tranquilized for three days. So you may need medication.

79
00:07:50.760 --> 00:08:03.300
Dr. Belis Aladag: To cover you while you're getting off the gap. It kind of lowers your central nervous system and you need another inhibitor of your nervous system so that it doesn't flare into seizure.

80
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:13.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, slowly, use the other. So basically we use benzodiazepines to, kind of, we knew off of the gap.

81
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you stop gap and you get on like something like value or something and then slowly, we get you off the value

82
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: So they know how it should work.

83
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now, that process is usually best done

84
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:45.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: For or, at least, I would say it would probably take three to five days in an inpatient setting three to five days in a in like an inpatient detox facility.

85
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:56.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, where you go, and there's nurses and they give you your medication. They monitor you and stuff like that. Just because we don't want you to go into seizure and if anything happened, they can help. Okay.

86
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:06.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I think that's what we need to do. I think an inpatient detox is the safest for you for three to five days.

87
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:17.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: To focus on the gap, it's really not about the meth not medically. We don't need to worry too much about that. It's more going to be about how are we getting off the gap and we need to treat you for that.

88
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:38.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, now in terms of your insurance and your doctor saying, you know, I'm not sure if it will cover. You know, I, you, I would be you. We have to find out. And so the way we find out is there is a number in the state of California and

89
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's called SAP see

90
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.920
moRganic: Because I

91
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:56.880
moRganic: I have called them the national help line for that. I'm not sure if it's the same number, but they couldn't help me and I've also gone to system of cares

92
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:05.640
moRganic: With a j o d assessment and they signed me up for the same thing, just the drug rehab thing that outpatient and they still I've been to

93
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.340
moRganic: I've called both and been to both

94
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I'm substance abusers.

95
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.090
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, this should be it. So write this number down

96
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.080
Okay.

97
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: It is

98
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:29.430
moRganic: 8448040 crap. Sorry, one second.

99
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:31.920
moRganic: Okay.

100
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: 844

101
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Uh huh 804

102
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.200
moRganic: Okay.

103
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.440
8047500

104
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:46.980
moRganic: Okay.

105
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.530
moRganic: 844-804-7500 got it.

106
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, that is a

107
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: I believe it's it's all California

108
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:18.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you call and what they're supposed to do at that number is do an assessment. So like those other numbers you contacted you mentioned. Did they do a screening where they're like, Okay, what's your substance and you tell them hey GH be

109
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.560
moRganic: Yes.

110
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: And after all that they said you need to outpatient treatment.

111
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.540
Yes.

112
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.130
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

113
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.130
moRganic: It's called, it's called system of cares

114
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.990
moRganic: Sacramento.

115
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: System of cares. I'm wondering if it's like their version of what I just gave you. I don't know.

116
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:46.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: But what I just gave you should be doing a triage essentially where they're like, Okay, so what's your substance. How often are you taking it.

117
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:57.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: And what do you need and you say, Hey, so, so my recommendation is try to call them and tell them you need inpatient detox, just tell them from the get go say I've seen a prime

118
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:11.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: primary care doctor. And then, and then I also saw addiction doctor and addiction doctor tells me this is dangerous to stop suddenly you know like dangerous. The stops alcohol, suddenly you need treatment.

119
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:28.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Say that I need medication and she said that because I take it so frequently so many times for a year and a half. She thinks it's best if I monitored for seizure control in an inpatient detox facility. So with my insurance. What are the inpatient detox facility options.

120
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:40.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, hopefully, if you dictate to them what you know you're being told you need. They will not go to the default like okay, you just need to go to outpatients like no you need some medical intervention.

121
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.460
moRganic: Okay.

122
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that would be my best advice to you. Now if you try that number and it doesn't lead to anything.

123
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:56.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: I want you to call us back. I want the virtual clinic, the one that you just called into

124
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, to help you get connected to the level of care you need

125
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.400
moRganic: Okay.

126
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you try on your own and say, look, this is what I need, I need to go to detox for three to

127
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:19.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Five days you know whatever for GH t, which is a tranquilizer which is similar to value them or Xanax, that's the kind of family, we're talking about. So people that aren't familiar, you can tell them. That's what it is like

128
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you may

129
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just like those things you don't suddenly stop them. You can have a seizure.

130
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:40.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's the detox, you need and then once you do that, then you call you know obviously if if that goes well, you call us back and I'm happy to see you and we'll hook you up with therapy and, you know, doctors visits. If you needed and all that, but I think

131
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your priority is this, you got a detox, you know,

132
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.330
moRganic: Yeah.

133
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:56.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: And once you detox. Then we establish care and then we say, okay, Morgan like meet with me, weekly, and let's talk about sobriety and how are you going to stay strong and

134
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:09.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your body and your mind are so used to the gap. What are we going to do instead. Maybe we'll put you on something like Gabba Penton to kind of ease you you know Neurontin or gabapentin. I don't know if you've ever been on those things. But

135
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:23.940
moRganic: I've heard about him because he went, I went to jail. And I was only in jail for a short time and they finally gave me medicine like that they do for people on alcohol, but the day that that happened.

136
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.430
moRganic: My whole body. It felt like I was just dying, and then all of a sudden I got

137
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:39.330
moRganic: Like all these geometric shapes started flying towards my eyes and this girl. She's got a wet bra and put it over my eyes while I'm in the cell.

138
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:50.700
moRganic: And my whole body started getting really hot. And I started shaking and then it got really cold and then really hot really cold for about one to two minutes and then after all that was done, I had to

139
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:58.860
moRganic: Take a really like that is shit I ever took in my whole life. And it stunk so bad. And then after that, that's when I was like

140
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:12.930
moRganic: A seen all these pictures like flashing in my in front of my eyes it for like days and I was had like this altered state of mind. It was like very, very, very scary. And that's when they finally gave me medicine for for alcohol but yeah

141
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: And that was, Was this the five days in July.

142
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.180
moRganic: No, that was before that.

143
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, okay, what, when did you go to jail loans that

144
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.850
moRganic: And that was

145
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:31.230
moRganic: Crap. That was I probably say, six months before that, or so.

146
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, watch you like like

147
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: Almost

148
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: A year ago.

149
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.000
Right.

150
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Like maybe January 20

151
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.920
moRganic: Oh, you know what it was, um, February.

152
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.010
moRganic: February 2018 yeah

153
00:15:53.430 --> 00:16:03.690
moRganic: And I've been pregnant also three times for this whole year and a half. And every time I've lost all three babies and it was all during which was to

154
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: During the withdrawal. Yeah.

155
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:20.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Be nice. Okay, I believe it. Yeah, your body's. It's not a yeah withdrawing from this is not a joke. It's very serious. It can be fatal, it could lead to death. Right, it could lead to seizures. So you're already having hallucinations and stuff. Yeah, that's very

156
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:34.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: That makes sense. So I'm glad that eventually they got you some medication in the jail and yeah the medication, we use for alcohol withdrawal is the medication same type of medication, we would use for you for this. Yes, that's correct.

157
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:46.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: So they use the right medication. So now we need we need that we need you to be monitored and and given that kind of medication for three to five days and then released

158
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:56.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then we can kind of talk, you and I, about Open House. Now, how do we stay sober away from this. Okay, great. We got off of it. I don't want to start it again because getting office such a hassle.

159
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.980
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah boy out and

160
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:09.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, how do I stay, you know, calm and, you know, because if it's a tranquilizer. So you're probably used to it, calming you down and kind of giving you relief.

161
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:24.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you have to find a new way of being without it. Right. Yeah. So it's a challenge. It's not an easy thing. But I think it's something you're I'm so glad you're at a place where you're like, I gotta do this. I have to stop.

162
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:32.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because it'll just eat you up. You know, it's very toxic all of it, you know, the stimulant the math. And then this and you know

163
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.540
Right.

164
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.250

203
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.630
moRganic: But, um, and he doesn't use drugs he smokes weed, but

204
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

205
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:31.950
moRganic: Yes, it's it, but we're not that close, but we have known each other for a long time and I so I rent a room from an older person who doesn't think that are used at all. Um,

206
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.410
moRganic: It's older black man.

207
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.730
moRganic: And other than that, I really don't have too many friends.

208
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.350
moRganic: Yeah.

209
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:53.250
moRganic: And the G and the GSB, is actually, it's one for butane dial is what it really is, which is a, it's a industrial soul event that you can get online.

210
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you get it online.

211
00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:03.120
moRganic: Yeah. And then once you digest it. Then you metabolize it and into it turns into g

212
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.970
moRganic: Or beautiful now. Yeah.

213
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:12.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's how you're taking it and then you interview just swallow it in water. What do you do

214
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.700
moRganic: Yeah. Just swallow it. Okay.

215
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.200
moRganic: Okay media.

216
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:33.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so yeah, so your access is through the internet. So once we, you know, get you into the detox. That's it. You know, you just gotta stop yourself from ordering and, I guess, you know, it's just so hard, because it's so accessible. It sounds like

217
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:40.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, but you have to be your own guard, you know. Yeah.

218
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:51.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: And what about the math. I do think that the math is going to be a problem to stay away from, or you think that once you get off this PHP.

219
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're going to

220
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Stay away or

221
00:22:53.580 --> 00:23:00.810
moRganic: I'm probably going to definitely stay away from it. I know that when I do try to because I was trying to tell other people that

222
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:11.280
moRganic: Oh, I can just, you know, jeez, my, you know, that's what we call it g is like my number one drug i don't i don't need math, but I realized when I go a couple days without it.

223
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:22.230
moRganic: I sleep too much and not even honestly puts me into like this weird delirium state and not the same as the G when I'm getting off the G. It's like a slow, painful.

224
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:34.860
moRganic: transitioning into the into the delirium, but when I stopped doing the math. It's like it's different. It's different kind of feeling, but it's really, it's really weird. It's hard to explain.

225
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:45.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: So either way, with both chemicals you feel like this physical kind of dependence, because you really get into this weird mental delirious state.

226
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right draw

227
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:54.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: From them right so so all the more reason to be in an inpatient facility. When you're detoxing off both

228
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.140
moRganic: Okay.

229
00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:02.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: So when you do an intake. You know, when you do a screening triage like the 800 number 844 number I gave you

230
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:09.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or if you decide to call that other one again maybe try system of cares and if this one doesn't work.

231
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:22.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Whenever you're going through the triage mentioned those. These are key things just say, Look, when I'm withdrawing from the map and I start to get delirious. And, you know, delirium and stuff like that. Very strange symptoms.

232
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:39.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think because of the combination with the gh be the tranquilizer. And the tranquilizer one. Yeah, I definitely have experienced the delirium and just very, you know, hot, cold, all those things very severe symptoms physical symptoms that you know only went away after they gave me

233
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:48.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know treatment for like alcohol withdrawal in the jail you can give that as an example like I otherwise I think I would have gone into a seizure, you know,

234
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: just mentioned, like you need. So you need to be in a monitored setting.

235
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:59.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that they watch you so you don't get delirious. So you're, you know, and if you are you're reoriented and you're in a safe.

236
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: Place so that you can really stay clean and off in a safe manner.

237
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:15.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: And when you exit from that facility, you'll start from like a clean slate. Hopefully, I mean, you may not feel 100% but hopefully you won't be delirious. And on your own and trying to manage, you know,

238
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.020
Okay.

239
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, and then if that boyfriend or significant other.

240
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:35.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean, if he could, you know, be aware of what you're doing. So like if you're going to go into a detox facility, maybe let him know what's going on and why you were advised to do that, but it's for your safety and then

241
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:45.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: That you're going to really appreciate his support when you come out to like remind you of your goal of like you're not going to use anymore though, you know, like, just to have that at least one support person.

242
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.500
moRganic: Okay.

243
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, because it's hard to do all this by yourself.

244
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.180
moRganic: Yeah.

245
00:25:53.130 --> 00:26:11.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, so let's agree to do that, let's let's have you call this place. The 844 number, try to get them to give you the detox just say I need detox, whatever. Let's see what they say, if you can get it great. If not, maybe try the system of cares

246
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: If not,
