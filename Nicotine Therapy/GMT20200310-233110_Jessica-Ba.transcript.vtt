00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
Robert Hammond: Well, the final job and saw her smoking right there. When I was a main dining room.

9
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She's smoking.

12
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.120
Wow.

13
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It feels, you know, creating that boundary in your relationship.

14
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.820
Robert Hammond: About good

15
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.310
Robert Hammond: First place, you know,

16
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.710
Robert Hammond: So we're doing it was just

17
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what exactly did you say to her.

18
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.630
Robert Hammond: I told her that was

19
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.730
Robert Hammond: Looking I'm tired of it.

20
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.550
Robert Hammond: It's just all her dollar crabs just, you know, take it for granted. So

21
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:18.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's taken a lot of self control to be in the exact same room with someone having the pair familiar right there and your presence and having that self control to

22
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.510
Robert Hammond: Resist the temptation to use

23
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then also in the relationship that you've been in for a long time.

24
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.230
Robert Hammond: Right. I know. I think that's, I shouldn't be goes over

25
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I was gonna ask how you know how committed to you feel in this decision that you've made.

26
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.810
Robert Hammond: 100% in it so

27
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
Robert Hammond: You know, I don't want to hear there anymore. He is already over like

28
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.800
Robert Hammond: I've already added

29
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some of this is working.

30
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.720
Robert Hammond: BEEN COMMUNICATING more in my groups.

31
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even though when initially brought you here was kind of like making sure that you know you're compliant.

32
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're starting to see some of the benefits from coming and I also see you know improvement in your communication open up a little more good

33
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.010
Job.

34
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.180
Robert Hammond: Yeah, even though I don't didn't use. I know I'm going to come up dirty room smoked out will be bad. I even woke up feeling all pumped up

35
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.330
Yeah.

36
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, this, this has a lot of self control, like I said, because

37
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In addiction, you know if you think about it like red light, green light yellow light in your addiction. Everything was gone.

38
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There were no

39
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.830
Robert Hammond: Limitations.

40
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There were no stops.

41
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.190
Robert Hammond: There were no protections

42
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, you just

43
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:25.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Lived recklessly you were just on autopilot whatever you want it to do. You would do. And now in sobriety. It's like some yellow lights on red lights, something's telling you to slow down. Something's telling you this come to a stop and immediate stop.

44
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm wondering

45
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What were some of those yellow light indications are telling you to slow down when it came to this relationship and that maybe you should just come to an abrupt spot the end it.

46
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.940
Robert Hammond: Pretty much all that all the fact that she was still using i mean that's there's still

47
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.130
Robert Hammond: A thing right there for me.

48
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.930
Robert Hammond: Know, it was like she was supposed to try to get clean to herself, but

49
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.510
Robert Hammond: She Jaden looking for that so

50
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.300
Robert Hammond: But now my letter does feel like more structured

51
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.560
Robert Hammond: Got more purpose to it.

52
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.620
Robert Hammond: Which I put everything back together.

53
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.040
Robert Hammond: Cuz I mean just watching her just it's just ridiculous like just seeing the same thing play over and over and over.

54
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.620
Robert Hammond: You know, it gets tiring.

55
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A lot of people are afraid to do whether their

56
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Struggle with addiction or silver and that's leave a toxic relationship.

57
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.070
Robert Hammond: I mean,

58
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I was concerned with just the lack of respect that she had

59
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.040
The boundaries.

60
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.410
Robert Hammond: You know,

61
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.030
Robert Hammond: hitting you with the vehicle.

62
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just really no regard but we think about it.

63
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That like I said that addiction. She was on greenlight everything was gone.

64
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No rules or regulations and both of you can

65
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Someone's going to influence the other

66
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's good that you got out like could because over time.

67
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will it have been the possibility of her influence getting you to read that.

68
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.870
Robert Hammond: Right. Oh yeah, I felt that already just, you know, being around or maybe just as much about my skin.

69
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that was probably a goal. I

70
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wanted you to

71
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.510
Robert Hammond: You know,

72
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.950
Robert Hammond: slip up and

73
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.660
Robert Hammond: I know because I noticed that she was even stashing some of my spots.

74
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Really

75
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.830
Robert Hammond: And I was like, she would act like I was losing it. And I was like, No, no frickin losing myself.

76
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.230
Robert Hammond: To my boss.

77
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.350
Robert Hammond: Though you know there was like a lot of red flags going up like everywhere. So, yeah.

78
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said that you're now looking for work.

79
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.280
Robert Hammond: I'm trying to find something like more local

80
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.100
Robert Hammond: People don't want Toni Morrison to have a curfew basically

81
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How long is that for

82
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.820
Robert Hammond: All not on probation. It's just that the doctors only given me we've launched prescriptions.

83
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.810
Robert Hammond: So, okay.

84
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.490
Robert Hammond: So that kind of keeps me

85
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:39.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are there any other areas in your life where you feel like you need to create some boundaries. This is a big step.

86
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.440
Robert Hammond: I think isn't normally all my relationships, basically, just as you know. So, my friends, you

87
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.120
Robert Hammond: Know, I noticed that I'm trying to take more advantage of new stuff to to friends just recently.

88
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.230
Robert Hammond: Asking me for stuff but never, never wanting to help out.

89
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What kind of advice would you give to the young Robert

90
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.900
Robert Hammond: About relationships.

91
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.550
Just in general.

92
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.500
Robert Hammond: I don't know. There's so much that

93
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.290
Robert Hammond: I just done to keep his eyes open. You know that there's always gonna be somebody someone else.

94
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.540
Robert Hammond: Not to be stuck in a frickin toxic relationship or even have to be treated that way.

95
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.300
Robert Hammond: You know,

96
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:59.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some hearing that maybe some low self esteem played a part in you stay in that relationship.

97
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.420
Robert Hammond: Oh yeah, well it's doing it just to basically hurt myself punish myself where my kids.

98
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.610
Robert Hammond: Like everybody said, you know, it's, that's not going to help you nothing so

99
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We talked about the ship I talked about it with you, but I know I've definitely brought it up in my

100
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Groups, how

101
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sometimes in the addiction and just so many things that you may have lost in the addiction.

102
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even

103
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.600
Robert Hammond: Enjoyable activities.

104
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not the same, because the newer an addict.

105
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There were things that was given

106
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.470
Robert Hammond: To me, I'm sorry, you

107
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:44.970
Robert Hammond: Cut out

108
00:09:45.210 --> 00:10:01.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so in the addiction, there was this thrill right you got this adrenaline rush from the high, you got the adrenaline rush from probably the risky lifestyle of getting the drugs and hiding the drugs and all this stuff and

109
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In addition, the brain. It was being rewired

110
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.700
With addiction.

111
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:17.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your brain was sending signals of overload of dopamine and dopamine is that feeling of pleasure.

112
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:30.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so when you become sober. Now your body shutter release natural amounts of dopamine and you never feel that same amount you did when you got high

113
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:38.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you may go through life feeling like it's blah, not really exciting. I'm just here I'm just existing

114
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:48.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And when you have that mindset, it would make sense that over time you would start thinking, well, maybe I deserve this.

115
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:56.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And like you said, feeling less than that you didn't deserve deserve to be with

116
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anyone else that was healthier. You deserve to be in this toxic relationship.

117
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm wondering when the change pain for you to where you came to the realization that you no longer deserve this.

118
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it came before personal going up in that room.

119
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:24.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. That was the last straw. But when did you start feeling in your being that you deserve more

120
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.140
Robert Hammond: Honestly us even before waiting for her.

121
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.210
Robert Hammond: But

122
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.730
Robert Hammond: Like, like I said, I think it was just because the whole doozy. My kid is taking

123
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.440
Robert Hammond: Me back to

124
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.400
Robert Hammond: To where I was like way years before that.

125
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.750
Robert Hammond: When I was with my son's mom because it was the same thing. And you know, I was pretty crap and

126
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:57.030
Robert Hammond: Finally, when I got tired of it. That's when we had our problems, you know, because she she thought I was going to take it all that time.

127
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.680
Robert Hammond: You know, but I was already gotten sober and everything. So, yeah.

128
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.150
Robert Hammond: But

129
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.730
Robert Hammond: That was pretty much when I started, I know I did feel better better about myself.

130
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.670
Robert Hammond: I wasn't as depressed anymore.

131
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.600
Robert Hammond: That's weird.

132
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you start changing what you did throughout the day. Did your routine come become a little different.

133
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.340
Robert Hammond: When resist really just recently well

134
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Over time because I find that, um, when we start

135
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: adding things to our routine that gives us pleasure and joy and excitement or purpose we start looking at life in a different way because it's like, Okay, if I can do well at this one of the magnet.

136
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it's just a different step in this progression. So

137
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I am the member and and that first time we have that session and how the press, you are when you thought about your son.

138
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:22.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even saying the word son was a trigger for you and you would become so depress it was hard to pull you out of it and it's still hurtful for you. But now you're able to talk about it with a little, a little more freely.

139
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:35.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm wondering if over time you started changing your routine and doing more things maybe working more doing something you enjoy to kind of get you out of that depressed mood. Was there anything that you did different

140
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.920
Robert Hammond: Different

141
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.730
Robert Hammond: Got a couple of good things happen. Yeah.

142
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That are those the things

143
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.700
Robert Hammond: Just the other day when I was eating some chicken nuggets from McDonalds.

144
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.340
Robert Hammond: I built into one that had a bone in it.

145
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.390
Robert Hammond: Right. And he ended up shipping, one of my cheese.

146
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:02.910
Robert Hammond: So,

147
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.810
Robert Hammond: So even though that was like a bad thing that still looking for the lawsuit on that.

148
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.250
Robert Hammond: record breaking be able to get my kid back. Oh, wow.

149
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.710
Robert Hammond: Not be able to get the attorneys and all that. Wow.

150
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.380
Yeah.

151
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:29.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We did talk about small victories in my group so that it's funny that some of the things we're talking about in group coming up in this conversation.

152
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:37.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that was one of the things I asked the group. What are some small victories and someone had a situation to like that where it was.

153
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.620
Robert Hammond: Something that was negative terrible

154
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thing but, in turn, it led to a positive outcome. So

155
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, hopefully that will yield a positive outcome for you.

156
00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we fat with the financial assistance, you'll have more ability to fight for your son.

157
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.980
Robert Hammond: Right.

158
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:12.210
Robert Hammond: I know I started looking into it too and everything. I even got a little bit closer because the restraining orders are off now.

159
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.560
Oh, good.

160
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.270
Robert Hammond: So,

161
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.770
Robert Hammond: I still haven't made contact yet, but I was getting ready to

162
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.990
Robert Hammond: Be nervous.

163
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm seeing a

164
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.630
Robert Hammond: Different way because it's like

165
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:44.490
Robert Hammond: That whole time I'm sitting there punishing myself, you know, finally, you know, people told me, Well, what are you gonna do when you do get him.

166
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.970
Robert Hammond: And it's like, I have nothing because I find myself so much

167
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.510
Robert Hammond: So I don't even have nothing for him to, you know,

168
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.230
Robert Hammond: To come back to you. Yeah.

169
00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you want to be a whole person when you get your son. You don't want to be this depressed.

170
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:11.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Person that and how you assign is trying to figure out, okay, who is this person.

171
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:20.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know you want him to be able to say, Wow, this is what I missed out on and getting to have a relationship with

172
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I share my screen with you because

173
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:34.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wanted to just go over some different things to find more ways for you to experience pleasure.

174
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.740
Robert Hammond: More ways for you to get that home.

175
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that spark of excitement. These are a list of different things here.

176
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On the calendar on the

177
00:16:47.430 --> 00:17:01.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On my screen. Is there anything that you that you do that you may not realize are actually ways to release that dopamine. We talked about an experience pleasure. Is there anything on this list that you already do.

178
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see it or using it as a woman.

179
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.460
Robert Hammond: No, I got it.

180
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.650
Robert Hammond: I'm sorry. So keep on calling and they keep playing it mutes out the other sound.

181
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.690
Robert Hammond: Oh god, I am i do not disturb on and still going through. I don't know what there.

182
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:17.880
Robert Hammond: Did you catch

183
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me to repeat it.

184
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.790
Robert Hammond: One of these do I do that reduces building

185
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:41.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Which ones do you do that is a pleasurable activity, you may not have thought that it was a pleasurable activity, but these things on a list are pleasurable activities and they can release some of those natural transmitters of dopamine that I talked about.

186
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.440
Robert Hammond: I do a lot of these already. Yeah, like what

187
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.130
Robert Hammond: I'd like I read the bike I go for walks

188
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.470
Robert Hammond: I don't really dog but

189
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.160
Robert Hammond: I try to try to stay next

190
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.490
Robert Hammond: To lifting weights.

191
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.730
Robert Hammond: I was just reading you're doing

192
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.260
Robert Hammond: Good to give a better, best, but

193
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.600
Robert Hammond: That was where my buddies dog.

194
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.490
Robert Hammond: And I was watching

195
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:41.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you ever think that some of these things that you were doing were actually things that you're adding into your routine to create pleasure.

196
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.730
Robert Hammond: Or, you know, just

197
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.520
Robert Hammond: Just cuz I had to do them like

198
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:57.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So even when I think about how you you know washed your arm, your friends.

199
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:14.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that that allow for that nurturing component to come out that nurturing from component that you want to release because of your son. And so it gave you another opportunity to be a caretaker to be a nurturer and to help somebody because like you

200
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Told me a few sessions ago when we watch the drama triangle. You said you identify as the rescuer so you kind of

201
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:42.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: End up helping people out, you know, it just they become a call you and so finding that balance is good. And so having opportunities where you can help other people also build up that self efficacy, which is confidence that I'm a good person.

202
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And to pick things

203
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:52.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For where that imbalance comes when there's so many people that's calling on you, taking advantage, you're not eating.

204
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.100
Robert Hammond: Right.

205
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:07.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But the washing the dog. That sounds like a good opportunity to be in a nurturing role to help out. And it's not an ongoing commitment. It's like, all right, I'm helping out with this and

206
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.820
Gone.

207
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:20.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And in the riding a bike in the swimming. Oh my gosh, the relaxation. The exercise is being released in your body.

208
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That surge of

209
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Energy that comes to your body. Those are all the things

210
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about music you listen to music.

211
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.760
Robert Hammond: Well, not that much.

212
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.980
Robert Hammond: And we're gonna watch the demo.

213
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.270
But

214
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.570
Robert Hammond: I did go on one of those on add James to

215
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: eat ice cream, ice cream.

216
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.820
Robert Hammond: I'm somewhat. What is it,

217
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.490
Robert Hammond: That produces good

218
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.330
So, yeah.

219
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:38.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you appreciate in life and just taking a moment to appreciate the small things that you're doing that is actually giving purpose making you feel connected to the community connected within who you are validating that inner top that says I'm good enough.

220
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.400
Robert Hammond: Right.

221
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:52.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what you would probably say to your younger self. You mentioned you will tell your younger self that there's more than one out there, you know, in addition to that, maybe you can say I'm good enough.

222
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I deserve better.

223
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.560
Right.

224
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.960
Robert Hammond: That's right. One of my friends just just by

225
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.990
Robert Hammond: Calling me. Okay.

226
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're wrapping up in like five more minutes. Okay.

227
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:13.980
Robert Hammond: Sorry about that.

228
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be okay

229
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.330
Robert Hammond: Yeah, I just don't know that I'll be I'll be done. Just a minute.

230
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.140
So, yeah.

231
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:40.290
Robert Hammond: Right, I do feel like I do see like a lot of things that I was overlooking taking for granted on this.

232
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's one thing that you could pick from this list that you would like to incorporate or try, what would it be

233
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.380
Robert Hammond: I'd say probably 3060 starting like my own thing on the Internet.

234
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.830
Robert Hammond: Like my own company on the internet. Okay.

235
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What company would it be

236
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.030
Robert Hammond: Not quite sure yet.

237
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was that

238
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.850
Robert Hammond: Not quite sure yet.

239
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:20.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So would it be like someone watching it wouldn't. Would it be a YouTube channel or your business website.

240
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.600
Robert Hammond: I'd like to be a business website but

241
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.000
Robert Hammond: We're, you know, something that can

242
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.620
Robert Hammond: Come off of

243
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:43.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Specialty and the last time you had a session, you were under a car so vehicles, you do other thing.

244
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.130
Robert Hammond: I do just about everything. So, but I just like fixing things

245
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.100
Robert Hammond: Or whether it's car electronics

246
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would you name that that website will be the name of your business.

247
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.140
Robert Hammond: I don't know if that's a rough one,

248
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.840
Robert Hammond: Cuz even so I'm like, I'm still like a movie I trade so

249
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.100
Robert Hammond: Then I have my plumbing degrees. Well,

250
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.070
Robert Hammond: So,

251
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you have a variety of skill sets.

252
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's just up to you to decide where you want to put those skills, where you want to put those resources.

253
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:36.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Speaking of resources, what boundaries are you going to put in place to keep this relationship.

254
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ended

255
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because she doesn't think it's over.

256
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There may be some follow up from her. So now you start thinking preparation.

257
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:58.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What boundaries, would you put in place, you know, if you fix someone's vehicle and you saw the reason why the vehicle was in such a bad state.

258
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Would you just fix the vehicle and say, all right, you're on your way. Or would you tell the person. Hey, in the future, you want to do A, B, and C to avoid the situation.

259
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.900
Right.

260
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.760
Robert Hammond: Right, so

261
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what measures are you going to put in place to avoid getting back to that toxic relationship.

262
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.600
Robert Hammond: I need, I need to let her know that I did is done and all that. But no, I don't want it on more than one

263
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:34.500
Robert Hammond: Because I know that's what's going to start doing that she's going to even try to bring up like just trying to be friends or whatever. No, that's all you're not going to work.

264
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.570
Robert Hammond: So sneaky straight away from it.

265
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.230
Robert Hammond: From going to act on it, which I'm not gonna deal with do any of that part but

266
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:54.600
Robert Hammond: Basically at the blocker from my phone and everything. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Are you on social media.

267
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or anything

268
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.840
Robert Hammond: Yeah, but she doesn't have my my things

269
00:25:59.730 --> 00:25:59.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh,

270
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, that's, that's different.

271
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I always struggled with that when I hear it so that maybe that was another time.

272
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.970
Robert Hammond: You guys want a relationship. But you weren't friends on social media. No, I don't. I usually don't go on Facebook or anything like that. Okay.

273
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.580
Robert Hammond: I can get it for my, my kid.

274
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, okay.

275
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.650
Robert Hammond: So you could be rejected old me

276
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Alright, so they know that it's over. Are you going to call first or if she calls, then you're going to this one. These are things you want to put in place.

277
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.540
Robert Hammond: Right. She had already text.

278
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.090
Robert Hammond: Texting kind of going off so like already

279
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.480
Robert Hammond: Already with the first X yard, you know,

280
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.580
Robert Hammond: Sit her mind so

281
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.670
Robert Hammond: I just got blown up or down, let her know

282
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.710
Robert Hammond: Yeah.

283
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Does she have access to where you live. Does she have a p or anything like that. No.

284
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.280
Robert Hammond: She doesn't have abused as an agrarian

285
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.880
Robert Hammond: I know I gotta watch out because I know I heard from other people that she's already stocks and

286
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.330
Robert Hammond: That's something so

287
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.310
Robert Hammond: Be prepared.

288
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:27.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be prepared and don't give in to the fact that because it can feel validating and it can feel

289
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Rewarding that you know someone's interested in you and they want to know what's going on. So, you know, that can be something that eventually over time, you may have given. So that's why in this season. It's important to occupy yourself distraction can be a very

290
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.610
Robert Hammond: healthy coping tool.

291
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:56.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To keep yourself busy so that when you're by yourself. You're not thinking, well, you know, she's still interested. She's here.

292
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.450
Why not

293
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.360
Robert Hammond: Right, because I know that would be worth

294
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thinking about a name that you want for that website.

295
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Different things you want to put in place.

296
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.270
Robert Hammond: To protect yourself from that relationship. Oh.
