64
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.680
Rosamaria Romero: Clean up the house.

65
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:23.490
Rosamaria Romero: You know, have you know kind of have to be at the kids fix their beds, get dressed like I said no, brush your teeth stuff and then make breakfast.

66
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:33.540
Rosamaria Romero: And I usually go to work now at 10 but of course I told them. Today I'm going to be late because I have a really important meeting which Dan has to be with them for seven years. So

67
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they

68
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.210
Rosamaria Romero: They were okay with it.

69
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

70
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:48.750
Rosamaria Romero: You should go to work to one and then home and make lunch clean up the house because you know how kids are a clean up in the morning and then I come back and their blankets unfolded and

71
00:08:49.890 --> 00:09:02.580
Rosamaria Romero: You know, just the toys are all over. So I after I make one day just clean up again and then I have my little one on one time with my son. And, you know, like I said,

72
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.530
Rosamaria Romero: He has this with this dry erase book to where he could

73
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.680
Rosamaria Romero: I don't know. I don't know when when you were younger. I'm sure you did, but like when I was younger, they had

74
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:32.340
Rosamaria Romero: You like like in kindergarten, how they would have, like, like the letter A and then it would it would have like like lines and then you would you would have to keep copying it. So he has a book like that with all the alphabet.

75
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it can dry erase so

76
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, right. Um, and then

77
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:46.860
Rosamaria Romero: City race it and then the next day when whenever we do our, our again you could do it again. You know, so that we keep buying books over and over and over.

78
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:56.790
Rosamaria Romero: So you so yeah so then I have my time with him after making lunch cleaning up the house and then by time. I know what I'm making dinner and then getting them.

79
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:06.660
Rosamaria Romero: In their bath and pajamas and then I'll let them watch a little bit of TV or a wallet. While have like on Friday nights we have a movie night.

80
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:23.040
Rosamaria Romero: We'll, we'll all watch a family movie or something or, you know, all they all let him watch you know like a, like, an hour, um, you know, whatever he chooses. But of course, supervised by me.

81
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:38.250
Rosamaria Romero: You know, of course, I'll have to approve what of what he's watching. And then he goes to bed and I put my eco the baby to bed and and my daughter, she's 13 so she knows she knows her. She knows what she needs to do. I don't need to, you know,

82
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.710
Rosamaria Romero: I don't need to tell her anything she knows

83
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.870
Rosamaria Romero: The other her routine down and then that's it. And I, and I go to bed and then it's the same the same thing, the same thing in the morning, so

84
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.770
Rosamaria Romero: It's the same routine every day.

85
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. And that's what we need right consistent routine.

86
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.090
Rosamaria Romero: Consistent routine. Yes, that's what I'm that's what keeps me

87
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:11.640
Rosamaria Romero: I guess you know staying busy keeps me from from not thinking so much

88
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.010
Rosamaria Romero: And you know we when you're just at home bored and not doing anything that's all you do is thinking

89
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.870
Rosamaria Romero: Thinking. Thinking. These are stressing yourself out for absolutely no reason

90
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't, it's like

91
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.260
Rosamaria Romero: Why, why am I stressing myself out. Like there's there's times where

92
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:36.420
Rosamaria Romero: Where I, you know, like, I'm like, I'm really, really hurting from from down here and they took out my uterus and

93
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:53.910
Rosamaria Romero: Sometimes I have to call him to work and be like, you know, can you give me like an hour and a half to get to work. I kind of just need to just sit in the hot bath, you know, because I'm you know I'm just, I'm just not really feeling too good down there and

94
00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:10.830
Rosamaria Romero: So, you know, there's times where you know I have. I have. I have bad my, you know, my bad days. But yeah, they, they end up progressing through the day, you know, as, as time goes on. But like I said, I just I just keep I just can't like to keep myself busy and stay positive.

95
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.730
Rosamaria Romero: No matter the situation, even if it's a negative situation like like this eviction

96
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.740
Rosamaria Romero: You know situation that I'm going through. I'm just understanding. I'm just being positive about it because

97
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.230
Rosamaria Romero: I was actually

98
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.050
Rosamaria Romero: I was explaining to

99
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.770
Rosamaria Romero: My glasses. I'm sorry. They keep falling off my face and I can get them Titan because

100
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.860
Rosamaria Romero: The craft and

101
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.410
Rosamaria Romero: Close.

102
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:54.690
Rosamaria Romero: But anyway, I'll speaking to to Danielle and I actually forgot to bring this up in group you actually been I had told her that I had did

103
00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:06.780
Rosamaria Romero: An experiment of negativity and positive and positivity. How, how it affects your life so. So one day I thought okay I'm gonna be

104
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:17.550
Rosamaria Romero: I'm gonna be negative. And I'm going to think negative all all day today. So I mean, of course, not towards my kids or anything, but just like what's going on with me, you know,

105
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.350
Rosamaria Romero: So like, like what the eviction and all that. Well, I was just like, Okay, you know, like

106
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:41.760
Rosamaria Romero: I'm not gonna, I'm not going to think positive. Today I'm gonna, I'm going to kind of let myself stress out and be like, so I did so. Okay, so one day. So the. So one day I woke up, I went about my day. And, um, I just started thinking, you know, like, Oh, what am I going to do you know

107
00:13:42.990 --> 00:14:02.790
Rosamaria Romero: What if things don't go right for me. You know what, what if I can't find new house. I'm gonna, you know, I have my kids. It's, you know, and it started really stressing me out. And it's hard to give me more anxiety than then then I then I need and I started having panic attacks, you know, and

108
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:17.880
Rosamaria Romero: So, uh, so I, the way I got, I went through my whole day, you know, just thinking negative about everything and I noticed that, that it brought it didn't just only bring

109
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:31.980
Rosamaria Romero: Stress to me and and myself and and and and and only it didn't only just give me panic attacks and anxiety, but as well when when I got home from work.

110
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:43.530
Rosamaria Romero: It I it passed on to everybody that was around me. So I know that I saw the noticing that that that my that my kids were getting agitated.

111
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:51.750
Rosamaria Romero: I started noticing that my daughter was getting agitated, um, you know, I started noticing that the Father. The Father of my kids. He comes in the mornings to

112
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.520
Rosamaria Romero: Help me, you know, till five or whatever. And then he goes home, you know, every day.

113
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:09.360
Rosamaria Romero: So, um, and I said, notice I started noticing that negativity, from him as well too. And he was like, you know, what's wrong with you, like, I'm like, I'm feeling like he was they were all feeling my energy, especially him.

114
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:30.780
Rosamaria Romero: He's a, he's a very, very spiritual person like me. So like, like we we feel people's energies very, very strongly. So he was like, I'm feeling a really, really bad energy for me today, like what's going on with you. And, um,

115
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.270
Rosamaria Romero: I just told him you know I'm doing this experiment. I've been negative

116
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.740
Rosamaria Romero: All day today. I, you know,

117
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.060

Rosamaria Romero: Effect them as well. It it their attitude change.

119
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:11.130
Rosamaria Romero: They're getting like annoyed with me and Bob and I explained to them that it was just an experiment that that's not the way I am well and you know they understood, but still, they're filling my energy and it was bad.

120
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:21.420
Rosamaria Romero: So, okay, I got through through the negativity day and I noticed that everybody around me was just getting irritated and frustrated and stressed out and

121
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:34.470
Rosamaria Romero: I my energy would just be passed on to everybody that was on me, even people. I would love to go into a store and people around me. I could just fill their energy that they're feeling my energy and it just wasn't good. It was just no no good. No, by no

122
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:43.860
Rosamaria Romero: So then the next day I woke up and I said, Okay, today I'm going to think positive about everything. And that's how my day goes

123
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:57.450
Rosamaria Romero: That see if it, if it makes a difference if he will kind of what kind of difference it makes. So I got up in the morning and I said, Okay, I'm not going to let anything bother me. Today I'm going to think positive about everything.

131
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:23.310
Rosamaria Romero: I told them. So I explained to them. I told them. So, yesterday I was thinking negative all like, all day.

132
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:37.890
Rosamaria Romero: And did you guys notice when I came home how our agitator you guys were getting with me and how we use affiliate my energy and my my five year old and my 13 YEAR OLD, OF COURSE, they understood and they're like, yeah.

133
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:51.210
Rosamaria Romero: We have energy today. And they said, you know what your energy, IT FEELS GOOD. YOU I we feel happy when we're around you. We feel good energy we feel

134
00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:03.420
Rosamaria Romero: Like positivity and I said, Exactly. That's exactly what I'm trying to push off is to feel positive is to think positive stay positive be positive.

135
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:10.440
Rosamaria Romero: Push positivity on to whoever's around you if you see somebody that's thinking negative, you know,

136
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:18.630
Rosamaria Romero: Say, you know. Hello, sir. How are you, you know, how's your day. Do it. How was, you know, how's your day going, you know, you having a good day.

137
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:29.490
Rosamaria Romero: You know, just, just by doing that and and you know pushing out that that good energy could change that person's whole day you know from negative to positive

138
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:37.770
Rosamaria Romero: So in other words, so I did, I did the experiment with the naked with negative and the positive and of course

139
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:57.540
Rosamaria Romero: I mean, I noticed that it really does make a big impact on the people around you and not and not just the people around you but it affects you. Um, so how can I explain it. So, it affects you really, really bad.

140
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.110
Rosamaria Romero: But it affects ground you even more.

141
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

142
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.420
Rosamaria Romero: That makes sense.

143
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes.

144
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:12.120
Rosamaria Romero: You know, like, like, you know, like with the with the negativity part it affected my kids more

145
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.150
Rosamaria Romero: Than what it was affecting me

146
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:24.210
Rosamaria Romero: You know, I'm now when I was positive, it was, it was really affecting them more than them what it

147
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:25.650
Rosamaria Romero: Was

148
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:37.740
Rosamaria Romero: To me like they just fun. Laughing And wanting to do arts and crafts and coloring and just smiling and

149
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:46.470
Rosamaria Romero: You know, just it just made a really, really big difference. It was it was a really good experiment. So from what I learned from it.

150
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:57.780
Rosamaria Romero: Is that I'm not going to let negativity in my life anymore. I'm not going to allow that in my life anymore. I'm not going to think negative it anymore because

151
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:10.080
Rosamaria Romero: Ever since I did that experiment. And I realized how much it affects not just me, but the people around me i'm not i'm not wanting to make people feel that

152
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:21.180
Rosamaria Romero: That way just because I'm going through, through you know stuff in my life and I'm and I'm taking it in in a negative way instead of being positive

153
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:35.610
Rosamaria Romero: About it and pushing off a positive vibe and making everybody around me happy. You know, so yeah, so that's that that's what I learned to just cut negativity out of my life. That's what I've done. Ever since then.

154
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.380
Rosamaria Romero: I just been positive.

155
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:49.140
Rosamaria Romero: About everything I'm just not seeing in I'm not doing well, what if I don't find a house. What am I going to do on you know

156
00:21:50.190 --> 00:22:04.050
Rosamaria Romero: Like oh, like when i when i when i go when I when I go to work today is my client going to be in a bad mood is she going to be in a good mood, you know, how are things going to be, I don't, I'm not doing that anymore. You know,

157
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get

158
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:13.950
Rosamaria Romero: I get up and I'm just happy. I'm just, I go to work. And I'm just like, how, how are you today, you know, how did your morning start off

159
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:24.390
Rosamaria Romero: You know you. You seem you seem like you're like, if you're in a good mood today. Yeah, yeah. I am I am in a good mood. Would you like me to make you some coffee. Sure, sure, you know and and

160
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:35.970
Rosamaria Romero: And my days have just been going. They've been going great. They've been going good. I mean, you know, they, they just they've been going the way I expected to go, you know,

161
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

162
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.920
Rosamaria Romero: My days my days ago, the way I make it

163
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

164
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:55.140
Rosamaria Romero: By be positive, you know, of course. My days are going to go. Good. So yeah, so that's that's that's that's a real big deal that that I cut out of my life is negativity.

165
00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. And it seems to be working really well.

166
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.220
Rosamaria Romero: Made a really big.

167
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.180
Rosamaria Romero: Deal with situations, etc.

168
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good, and your kids feel it and you're happy. Yeah.

169
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.940
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah yeah

170
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just good

171
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.490
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah.

172
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:38.880
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, I mean, I just think, I just think, you know, like we only live once. So what for what for be negative all the time. And what for be unhappy all the time and constantly thinking and worrying all the time. I just think just just just leave it.

173
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:52.020
Rosamaria Romero: Will have, how does the single on just let go and be God. Just like just pretty much that it going to leave it in God's hands so that's that's what I do.

174
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's a good that's definitely

175
00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good stuff. So, okay. So tell me, is there anything you can identify that's not working, that you want to change.

176
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.620
Rosamaria Romero: That's not working. I'm

177
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you say I froze. A little bit.

178
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.540
Rosamaria Romero: Um,

179
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.830
Rosamaria Romero: I, I remember you asking me to think about this.

180
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:56.670
Rosamaria Romero: For everybody down and I've been thinking all week. And ever since I've been thinking positive I can't think of anything that I would want to Jane.

181
00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.040
Rosamaria Romero: I feel like

182
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.630
Rosamaria Romero: I feel like I feel like

183
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:11.610
Rosamaria Romero: Blocking negativity out of my life has really has really made a really big.

184
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.470
Rosamaria Romero: In a good way, in a positive

185
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:34.350
Rosamaria Romero: Rightly so, at this point, when, when I think about every, every little thing every, every single detail. My life everything with my kids with work with the situation on you know I'm I'm dealing with, you know, inside of me, what I'm going through physically

186
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.940
You know, mentally,

187
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:39.960
Rosamaria Romero: You know,

188
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:49.350
Rosamaria Romero: I, you know, dealing dealing with the pro, you know, not dealing with the program, but being consistent with the program and

189
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.470
Rosamaria Romero: Just, just to stay on schedule with

190
00:25:52.470 --> 00:26:02.430
Rosamaria Romero: Everything and all that. It just everything just seems as if it should be. So no, I don't feel. I don't feel like there's there's anything in my life that

191
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.410
Rosamaria Romero: I would that I would change. I feel like I feel like everything is falling into place, little by little, and of course I have some really big.

192
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.790
Rosamaria Romero: Really big issues that I need to work out like the

193
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:34.500
Rosamaria Romero: brunt of the house, for instance, that's my biggest issue. Um, and picking up more hours at work. That's, that's, that's probably that's probably one thing that I would want to change is is

194
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:46.050
Rosamaria Romero: To is to try to get more hours at work, which is really hard been been that I'm a caregiver and and this coronavirus is going on.

195
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:53.190
Rosamaria Romero: I think I told you this last week, a lot of the lot of the patients aren't one that's to go to their house.

196
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so

197
00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:13.500
Rosamaria Romero: So they they think much just like call it off. So I lose a lot of hours, but I tell them to let me know if you if you guys do get get any if you guys do get any clients that are like, you know what I do I need somebody here even though the sickness is going around just have

198
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:23.220
Rosamaria Romero: The employee come with a mask and gloves and I'll be fine, because I really need help, like to get stuff up on the shelf and you know I really need

199
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:37.410
Rosamaria Romero: Help me and my my kitchen cleaned up. No, because they, they, a lot of them don't have the the mobility skills, you know, like, like the way I do of course they're they're elderly we're, we're all going to be that each at some point and need

200
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

201
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:47.250
Rosamaria Romero: You know, so on. Yeah, so that's that's pretty much one thing, one thing that I would say I would want to change is just to get more hours at work.

202
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Well, it seems that, you know, definitely, you're in this flow. And you know what you're doing is working.

203
00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In so you know what i mean i say that you just continue on doing what you're doing and we will walk through any hurdles or bumps that come up along the way and and work through them, you know,

204
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're doing a great job. And I just want to tell you that last week when you and I met. We talked about your experiment.

205
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:33.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I took it to several of the groups that I went to that I'm involved in and just kind of thrown it out there on the floor and discussed it and talked about you know other people doing it too.

206
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which was really kind of amazing. You know a lot of people really open and receptive to hear it and to want to try it. So,

207
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.350
Rosamaria Romero: You know, Ray.

208
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have a pretty awesome.

209
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.980
Rosamaria Romero: So yeah, I'm so glad that you did that.

210
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.190
Rosamaria Romero: I'm, I'm so glad that you did that. I'm sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.

211
00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:11.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, it's just, it's great. And I just wanted to point that out you know that you know if it's working don't change it, you know, and if you have joy in your life over it and how you're doing it, don't change it because it's working right. And it was amazing to me how

212
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:27.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How open people were to want to make that change, you know, to mean to try it themselves, and see you know how it worked for them. So it's kind of like a little, a little pandemic.

213
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, running wild in of positivity and within bright heart as well. So, you know, I just want to tell you that you started this chain of events that I think is awesome.

214
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:53.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And thank you for for holding that experiment, you know, because we often teach people and tell them that you know your your thoughts control emotions, your emotions you know control action.

215
00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But really, you know, having a client that walked through it and did it. And, you know, has the proof that it's true was kind of amazing. And I think that other people were really open to hear it.

216
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

217
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.280
Rosamaria Romero: That is no right. That makes me feel

218
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:23.130
Rosamaria Romero: That makes me feel really, really good about myself, I feel, I feel proud. I feel really proud that

219
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.330
Rosamaria Romero: That I that I actually got through both experiments because

220
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:37.560
Rosamaria Romero: Most, most people can can get through it. They just can't stop thinking negative

221
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.270
Rosamaria Romero: You know, they like

222
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:47.730
Rosamaria Romero: You know, like, like, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm not speaking for anybody else. I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else or anything like that.

223
00:30:48.180 --> 00:31:02.490
Rosamaria Romero: I'm just speaking for myself. I'm thankful that that I was able to get through a full day of the negative and and seeing the reactions of the people around me and how it affected.

224
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:12.330
Rosamaria Romero: My actions, like you said, My thought yeah on the people around me. The actions their thoughts on the way we speak the way we talk to each

225
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:12.780
Rosamaria Romero: Other

226
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.340
Like Sandra.

227
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:37.200
Rosamaria Romero: And I was actually able to hold it from the morning until we went to bed and I and I was amazed i was like i was like, wow, I was actually able to stay negative the whole day because I'm usually a positive person I'm usually the I mean like, it's like I'm

228
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:49.230
Rosamaria Romero: In group last night, they had brought up, you know, they asked us to explain you know just just one thing in our family that that that we feel

229
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.630
Rosamaria Romero: Like like

230
00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:07.050
Rosamaria Romero: What well we felt we brought to the family. So no, I said I, I feel that I brought to my family like like leadership and independence and consistent

231
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:18.180
Rosamaria Romero: Because my I have, I have three older brothers three younger brothers and two older sisters and for some reason they they just, they all really looked up to me.

232
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.180
Rosamaria Romero: Since I was younger and they would always tell me you know

233
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:31.980
Rosamaria Romero: Even though you're younger than me. You seem so independent and you seem you're really consistent with what you do. You work hard for everything, who you have you have that you've always had nice cars.

234
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:43.440
Rosamaria Romero: You know you buy your own clothes you know you don't ask mom and dad for nothing. You, you work and you're consistent with your job you're you're consistent with with any everything that you commit to

235
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:55.110
Rosamaria Romero: Your you you could you could turn somebody that's having a bad day and you could turn their, their whole perspective around and and make their day.

236
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:09.990
Rosamaria Romero: Good. You know, just just just by talking to, to them and you know cracking a joke. And, you know, like, making them laugh and, you know, so, so I I felt that that they looked up to me. I felt that I brought leadership and

237
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.370
Rosamaria Romero: You know, and you know leadership and and like I said commitment and and

238
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.770
Rosamaria Romero: And and as well.

239
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:28.800
Rosamaria Romero: Oh, well, what does that mean word that that I wanted to use and

240
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.580
Rosamaria Romero: Consistency and

241
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.530
Rosamaria Romero: Independence.

242
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:42.780
Rosamaria Romero: Independence so so that's that's what I felt that I brought to the family so

243
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:52.380
Rosamaria Romero: That's why, that's why I say I've always been a positive person, so I thought it would. I thought it would have been hard for me.

244
00:33:52.950 --> 00:34:11.340
Rosamaria Romero: To. I mean, I'm not perfect of course through before I did this experiment. Of course I would have negative thoughts and I would have my negative days, but I would always try to get my myself back on track and start, start saying, No, I'm not going to think this way. I need to stay positive.

245
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

246
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:24.240
Rosamaria Romero: I will. I'm not back and forth. Now I'm just, I'm just steady and consistent with just positive now. Ever since I did that, that experiment it how it it Jen, it really, really helped.

247
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.080
Yeah.

248
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:39.840
Rosamaria Romero: 100% you know I'm so I'm just, I'm really, really glad that you pass it on to the group and I regret not bringing it up last night, but I still have next week, you know, on Tuesday.

249
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

250
00:34:42.000 --> 00:35:02.220
Rosamaria Romero: My group because that's something I think that that Dominique and Dr. Kendall would really, really like to hear and and see, you know, just what I what I told you to see how how how it affects people and how much it changed me and how much it affected my life.

251
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In a positive way.

252
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:11.040
Rosamaria Romero: You know, it's like I said on when I was thinking negative, everything would just going wrong for me, just everything was going wrong for me.

253
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:23.220
Rosamaria Romero: I would, you know, putting gas and it was squirting all over. And you know, I would go in the store and you know by a couple things and walk away without getting my change.

254
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:35.190
Rosamaria Romero: And then they're like, excuse me, Mommy forgot to change. And I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm just my mind just everywhere today. I'm just, I'm just, you know, kind of, because I'm thinking I'm thinking negative, you know,

255
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So like

256
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:46.650
Rosamaria Romero: On I'm thinking of all the bad things in my life to where I'm not focusing my number of cussing at all. So, so, you know, um,

257
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:55.380
Rosamaria Romero: So yeah, so now I'm just, I'm just staying positive. I'm not letting negativity come into my life anymore, of course.

258
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:03.720
Rosamaria Romero: I do get thoughts of negativity. I do something start getting thoughts and but I readily tell myself no

259
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:13.890
Rosamaria Romero: I'm not, I'm not going to do this to myself. I already been through, through the experiment I already know. I already know that the consequences and the actions of it.

260
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:33.990
Rosamaria Romero: So I'm going to rebuke it and I'm going to say a prayer, and I'm going to say no I'm not thinking negative. I'm not going to let those those thoughts come into my mind, I'm just going to stay positive. And, you know, and I've been. I've been good. I've been good. You know, I've been

261
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've been really yeah

262
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.150
Rosamaria Romero: So far, any

263
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.020
Difference.

264
00:36:38.340 --> 00:37:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, well I'm gonna, I am going to continue to pass that message on with everybody you know that I work with, and I would like for you to continue doing the same thing, you know. And if you find areas that you're struggling with, write it down and we will go through them.

265
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'm pretty sure with where your mindset.

266
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is Rosa that you know it's exactly where it needs to be, you know,

267
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.720
Did you hear me.

268
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:21.720
Rosamaria Romero: Right, right, right. And yes, yes. And you know what, I'm before I forget, on

269
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:33.030
Rosamaria Romero: I, you know, while I was taking down notes because when I had talked to, to Danielle. She told me to try to start keeping like like a diary.

270
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:43.740
Rosamaria Romero: Like of like whenever I wake up through the night and you know when I'm feeling withdraw and because the pain wakes me up, you know,

271
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

272
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:57.870
Rosamaria Romero: You've been hours and I've taken my medications three in the morning already, etc. Whatever. So she's like, you know, keep keep a diary keep a diary. So I downloaded this this diary, which was really, really.

273
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:04.590
Rosamaria Romero: Cool on my phone and notes and

274
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:21.660
Rosamaria Romero: I've been writing down the, you know, like thoughts, just like you said, you know, right. Write down your thoughts, you know, if I'm having a bad day, or if I'm starting to get a negative thought, write it down. What my negative thoughts about

275
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.260
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah. And you know why I'm feeling and

276
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.870
Rosamaria Romero: Right.

277
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:19.290
Rosamaria Romero: When they write for the panda. When I was a long time to get like to write. And when I start writing. It's like can stop. Yeah.

278
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, let it flow.

279
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:21.540
Rosamaria Romero: That's my

280
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.800
Rosamaria Romero: Thought just coming in there.

281
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.250
Rosamaria Romero: I mean in there.

282
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:31.530
Rosamaria Romero: So,

283
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:39.810
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, exactly right. It's my I end up losing my flow. And then I'm like, wait. Now I'm gonna ask her.

284
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.910
Rosamaria Romero: To start going back and start

285
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:20.340
Rosamaria Romero: And then I would be able to push save and then it will save the date and time that that I did it, but I ended up losing my phone. So I lost all of that that I've been keeping track. So next time I see Danielle i'm i'm not going to have

286
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:28.260
Rosamaria Romero: I'm not going to happen. I need to start all over again. And I'm going to have to write it down until I get a new phone.

287
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.160
Well, yeah.

288
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:39.180
Rosamaria Romero: And going to be until next payday and hopefully I get paid enough tip and get a new phone because like I said I'm not putting in like ours, you know,

289
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:50.730
Rosamaria Romero: Three hours a day, maybe sometimes one hour a day to day if I'm lucky, it's, it's nothing. And my kids need clothes. Sometimes I need, I need any more food.

290
00:40:51.210 --> 00:41:01.860
Rosamaria Romero: And so I can think about buying the new phone. You know what will my check comes out to be. So until then, I'm going to have to try to write

291
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:17.490
Rosamaria Romero: You know down the best I can, but I'm not gonna be able to write, you know, big ol paragraphs. I mean, of course, I could but like i said i i tend, I tend to stop like I have to stop because my hand hurts too much. It's

292
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice to did you when you filed your taxes. Did you file them in have direct deposit

293
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:34.080
Rosamaria Romero: Um no I didn't get direct deposits. I don't have. I don't have a bank account. I got I got check. I bought them, directed by check and

294
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:42.030
Rosamaria Romero: It actually, it actually really sucks because I I did my taxes through through this place and I'm

295
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:53.790
Rosamaria Romero: I mean taxes is already over with. But if you want to just keep this in mind. It's called united united tax firm.

296
00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:03.330
Rosamaria Romero: I did my taxes through them and I so okay so I did my taxes with them for 2018

297
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:12.720
Rosamaria Romero: And everything went fine you know I got my my federal my state tech everything went fine. I did it again with them this year and

298
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:21.570
Rosamaria Romero: The first time I did it with them. I asked them, okay. So I asked him so. So how much do you guys charge because you

299
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:30.360
Rosamaria Romero: Leave a you know somebody charges you know to do taxes, unless you go to the to the community college where there's volunteers that are do that does it for free.

300
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:43.290
Rosamaria Romero: They said, no, you get 100% of your, of your taxes guaranteed and also. Okay, great. You know, that's great. So the first year, it went fine this year when I did it.

301
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:57.330
Rosamaria Romero: They, they messed me over so bad, Rebecca. It's so awful. I'm having the, the Attorney General look into it. And, and, um, I actually still have to put in the complaint I

302
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:18.750
Rosamaria Romero: I hate it and I lost my son off dude all over again. But anyways, to get to the point they they charged me $1,025 just to do my taxes. Okay.

303
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's crazy.

304
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:25.080
Rosamaria Romero: And on top of that, they kept my state check

305
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:48.900
Rosamaria Romero: And they when I called when a call to confirm them about it. They told me that they sent me my state and my federal check together and I called so so then I called up the state. The state tax and revenue and they told me that's impossible. They can't mix a state and federal check together.

306
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:57.990
Rosamaria Romero: They, they can be possible there there's there's something suspicious going on, so they they already had messed up.

307
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:12.120
Rosamaria Romero: Because they said, Okay, well it's showing here that that that we sent your, your, your state check to a checking account. They said, Did you get your federal and

308
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:24.960
Rosamaria Romero: You know in your bank account. I said, no, I don't have a bank account. I got it through check and they said, well, we sent it to, to, to a bank account and you know 4346

309
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:33.510
Rosamaria Romero: I told them. That's not mine. So they so they looked into it. And they said, Okay, it's showing here that they're considered a third party.

310
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:42.570
Rosamaria Romero: And we directed we directed your state check into their account and now that we can't do nothing about it. They said,

311
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:49.080
Rosamaria Romero: So they made a really big, big mistake. So now they told me that to get in touch with the

312
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.850
Rosamaria Romero: Attorney General, which I did and he ended up contacting me. That's when he told me make the complaint and then we'll look into it.

313
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:10.260
Rosamaria Romero: And will, and then I told him how much they charged me to do my taxes you thought that's outrageous. It is $25 and that's that they told me that it's free. It's free, they guarantee

314
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:24.750
Rosamaria Romero: And and I trusted them and it's like it's like they they they real to me in one year. They did everything legit so that they could get me the second year and and and take me for all I got, you know,

315
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.830
Rosamaria Romero: And yeah did

316
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:35.850
Rosamaria Romero: So I added it up and they took. They took to that. So 1025 and 1016 they

317
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:50.160
Rosamaria Romero: So they took 2025 35 30% 39 4041 $2,041 from me. They tell

318
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:56.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is ridiculous. Well, the reason I was asking was because you know the stimulus check is coming out.

319
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you direct

320
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Deposited they would have gotten that today, right.

321
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if yours is going through the mail. Then you should have it within the next week or so is what I'm going to assume

322
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's coming and it's

323
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.030
Rosamaria Romero: Done well yes, actually, I was working on that all

324
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:19.380
Rosamaria Romero: Working on that on before I had got on with you because

325
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.830
Rosamaria Romero: You could go to this website. I haven't written down. It's an IRS

326
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.030
Rosamaria Romero: IRS slash gov or me.

327
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:44.310
Rosamaria Romero: Um, I can't remember, but it's like IRS gov dot dot something and I went to it and it's like a portal.

328
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:54.090
Rosamaria Romero: Where if you if you if you accept it. If you bought a check. You can go into that portal and and you could you could

329
00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:00.330
Rosamaria Romero: Put your, your checking your checking information into it.

330
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.490
Rosamaria Romero: You know, and it's so that so that you could get your, your, your money into your checking account.

331
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:21.240

333
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:43.950
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah yeah yeah because a lot, a lot of my friends are posting are posting on Facebook, you know, of course, people like to break, which I don't like to do do stuff like that on on social media.

334
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:58.770
Rosamaria Romero: But you know the posting on Facebook. Oh, I got my check today. I got my check today. So your yeah you know, obviously, you're right. So, hopefully. Hopefully I get my check within the next week because I really need that money.

335
00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:03.090
Rosamaria Romero: Yes, me what the word. You know what they did to me.

336
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:12.660

Rosamaria Romero: Yeah.

338
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.720
Rosamaria Romero: Stuff what bugs me the most is that

339
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.540
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, well, that's my my kids money, you know,

340

341
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:32.160
Rosamaria Romero: I have a question for you. And I don't know if you'll be able to answer it. So, so this year. Um, so I I'm not too sure if you're if you're aware, with what on

342
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:51.780
Rosamaria Romero: With what I was going through with the with the state. Um, I'm not too sure if I if I told you it long, long story short, I'm I'm through about two and a half years ago my door locks here where I live. I were broken.

343
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I cannot. Yeah.

344
00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.760
Rosamaria Romero: The manager over and over. Okay, so my son ended up will take custody.

345
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:06.750
Rosamaria Romero: Uh huh. I want him back. I want him back. Hey, I have full custody of him now, and all that. See, but I didn't have them all year. Last year, so I couldn't, I couldn't claim him.

346
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:14.940
Rosamaria Romero: Right, if I didn't claim him in my taxes. Will I still get the 500 frame. If I cleaned him in 2018

347
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:22.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would think that you would, because he's independent, but I'm not sure that's something that I would definitely ask the IRS.

348
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:29.640
Rosamaria Romero: Okay, a positive. Okay. Um, I've been trying to find a number for them, but I can't. It's

349
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:40.320
Rosamaria Romero: Hard to number for them. Well, on that portal on that portal that you go to, it gives you a website that you could moto and chat and chat with them.

350
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, perfect.

351
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, ask them whether or not you're going to get it for him.
