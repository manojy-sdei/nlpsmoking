Rhonda Towne: At the balloon Fiesta Park.

28
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:59.160

29
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.230
Rhonda Towne: They're not allowed to talk to the people.

30
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.420
Rhonda Towne: Okay, yeah.

31
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So this sounds like it's sort of a short term gig.

32
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:24.210
Rhonda Towne: Um, they go to certain places. He was, he had a really good site. I'm at journal pavilion where they did the concerts, where the studio places where they do movies.

33
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:43.920
Rhonda Towne: But it's completely shut down all the people there are working from home. That was his site. Yeah, yeah. So since it's completely shut down, they move everybody. A lot of the guys to the balloon Fiesta where everybody's at

34
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.980
Rhonda Towne: So, but he's he's trying to look, it's just nobody hiring right now.

35
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not the truth.

Rhonda Towne: So yeah, I tell him me save your money. You don't need stupid stuff.

50
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.980

Gwenevere Abriel: That's happening. I got you. You've got sort of these awareness is of your children. And what about their father. Is he being careful with money also

52
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.090
Rhonda Towne: He's feeling the pinch his mortgage is 1500 dollars.

53
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.650
Rhonda Towne: For bedroom 1500. The only reason why he got houses because the yard was huge.

54
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.990
Rhonda Towne: And he got it when he was still married to that lady, he was away.

55
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.560
Rhonda Towne: And she have been bailed. You know what I mean.

56
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.650
Rhonda Towne: And I'm now he's starting to feel it. So he's

57
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.330
Rhonda Towne: He's I told him I i

58
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:14.700
Rhonda Towne: Said this is kind of why I never wanted to buy a house with you. I mean, not that you would, yeah. You left me. But we had the kids together. Yes. But I said, um,

59
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:29.610
Rhonda Towne: I said, I did not want the burden of the house payment. That's the only i just i just didn't want that. And I'd rather have done the rent. So I said, Do you ever feel like you should just

60
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.020
Rhonda Towne: Take the hit on the repo.

61
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.190
Rhonda Towne: You know the repossession of a house you're

62
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about a foreclosure.

63
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.540
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I said it would that be better than the stress, you're just going through or

64
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.520
Rhonda Towne: I don't know.

65
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.350
Rhonda Towne: How was it refinancing or something through a local

66
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.570
Rhonda Towne: So he I guess he talked to one of the credit unions in town and

67
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.210
Rhonda Towne: I guess they gave him at least another two years before they didn't even think about it.

68
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

69
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.490

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.620

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how much pain are you in up in that and your gums and teeth.

85
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:20.250
Rhonda Towne: It's still sore, but not know where to where I was like oh my god you know what I mean. I just wanted to jump off the building that pain.

86
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.800
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, it's, it's not, not, no.

87
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if you know your goal. If I want to finish my dental work. I'm wondering if we should move that goal to something maybe like either June or July.

88
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:59.040
Rhonda Towne: Yes, because everything is. Yeah. They told me they'll only see me and everything, unless it's an emergency and they just won't see me just take care of everything, you know, that's all. The reason why gone in was because I was freaking crying.

89
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:08.040
Rhonda Towne: I was at the urgent care. You know what I mean, of course, they wouldn't give me anything for pain or nothing.

90
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:19.320
Rhonda Towne: Duke city urgent care had to call them and tell them you know what I mean, you guys got to get her in. She's, she's here, you know, in pain.

91
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.250
Rhonda Towne: And they got one of their doctors. What had had some

92
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.180
Rhonda Towne: How would you say it, he had some background in dental

93
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.880
Rhonda Towne: He took something to where he just shot me up a little

94
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

95
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.910
Rhonda Towne: So, yeah.

96
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so some of those teeth.

97
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: They four of them were taken out and you have managed to get through this pain and what were you doing to get through the pain. What did you end up doing.

98
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:21.780
Rhonda Towne: Oh, I did the or or a gel. Um, I couldn't do heating pad them. It kind of just seemed to make it worse by I did it for my ear like the ice piece or the corn and I did this can K or whatever mouth liquid stuff. This one is what I did.

99
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:31.560
Rhonda Towne: Okay, yeah. Smell the gross, but that's what the guy at Walgreens said to do. That's what I was using

100
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So it must be a topical.

101
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay, good. Okay.

102
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.480
Rhonda Towne: But the thing is, I was on an empty stomach and I puked

103
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:50.400
Rhonda Towne: And I could smell it coming out that was only thing with you. I was an empty stomach. I came out.

104
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

105
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:10.920
Rhonda Towne: I just have these mines and this one on this side left and I was hoping he would take those out since I was there and he said

106
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.840
Rhonda Towne: Since they're not hurting you know I can't really do anything about it.

107
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.370
Rhonda Towne: He

108
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:24.300
Rhonda Towne: Has to be done. You know, when we're when we reopen it. This is just for emergency

109
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too bad.

110
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.750
Rhonda Towne: Was I wish I could you know I would love to do him and get out of the way.

111
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.980
Rhonda Towne: So, yeah.

112
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And how, how many times did. It did that trigger the thought of wanting to self medicate with the buprenorphine or using short acting opiate

113
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.020
Rhonda Towne: Um,

114
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.140
Rhonda Towne: I

115
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:12.600
Rhonda Towne: I was thinking that I was thinking, even if I wanted to use opiates, or the ice. I took to be runner and nothing. It didn't even that thing I did even help

116
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.720
Rhonda Towne: What I did, but the Tylenol, I kind of put it

117
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.820
Rhonda Towne: In my step it around there. That's what help

118
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:38.490
Rhonda Towne: Um, and I, I even thought, even if I use the medication, the stronger anything. I was thinking

119
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.690
Rhonda Towne: I don't know if it would even help honestly

120
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you ground up Tylenol and you packed it into the area. The gum.

121
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.840
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, where it is. It was like putty. Like, like a mushy.

122
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.600
Rhonda Towne: That was the only way it helps

123
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.510
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

124
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.830
Rhonda Towne: That and I was told clove oil only, the only, only thing is, I couldn't find it.

125
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.020
Rhonda Towne: Because a lot of herbal places are closed.

126
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you lived through the pain and discomfort worked and maybe some of that busying yourself may have helped distract a little bit

127
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Possibly

128
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:52.380
Rhonda Towne: Yeah. And then people at work or like, Well, why don't you try, we, you know, the green stuff. And I'm like, that is one thing I never I just like alcohol i i i don't never develop the taste for alcohol and we just like yeah

129
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.590
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just

130
00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.310
Rhonda Towne: You know what I mean, it's just like me. You know how people have their own

131
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.920
Rhonda Towne: I was just like, I really don't care for that.

132
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got through it.

133
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:13.560
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

134
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so did you take more than your prescription of the buprenorphine.

135
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:25.680
Rhonda Towne: Boom, I think the first time I did and that's when I realized I don't think it's gonna work.

136
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So sometime between Wednesday and today we tried it.

137
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.640
Yeah.

138
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How many more milligrams. Did you take

139
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.350
Rhonda Towne: I think I took like

140
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.380
Rhonda Towne: I strip and a half.

141
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, Rhonda, how much more

142
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.610
Than your prescribed. Oh.

143
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.770
Rhonda Towne: I think I took, like, three eighths or something more.

144
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said it didn't bring meaningful pain relief.

145
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.920
No.

146
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:17.760
Rhonda Towne: And that's when I realized my sister in law was the one she was like, why don't you just

147
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.910
Rhonda Towne: The Tylenol and just

148
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.590
Rhonda Towne: Let it sit in warm water and

149
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.860
Rhonda Towne: Yes, she was the one that me

150
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's shift gears a little bit and I'm gonna, I'm going to ask you something.

151
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: These are things that typically I've done with people, a long time ago. And maybe it got lost in a note. So I'm going to show you something.

152
00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This blue stuff here.

153
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We're protective figure nurturing figure wise FIGURE. DID YOU AND I work together to develop imagery. So employees or a protective figure a nurturing figure wise figure. Do you remember ever doing that is from your imagination, remember ever doing that.

154
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.420
Rhonda Towne: Now, I don't think so.

155
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it.

156
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is Rhonda, oftentimes, you know, just now, you were using memory, right. You were recalling I had to fake. Oh, it was so bad. I went to urgent care and you were slowly you were remembering pieces that's memory.

157
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a different part of your brain that I'm going to be asking you to draw from, from today I'm going to be asking you to use sort of the right brain, which is your imagination. Okay, I don't want your favorite thing to do.

158
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But we're going to go for it. Okay.

159
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the instruction. We're going to come up with three figures, real or they can be imagined.

160
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And the ultimate goal is, we're going to have these three figures that we're going to be calling your resource team.

161
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're going to represent number one, a protective figure. So I'd like you first. And I'll go into the others in a minute. But first, I want you to think of either real or imagined what comes to mind when you think of a protective figure real or imagined.

162
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's quieter.

163
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In your thinking.

164
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.980
Rhonda Towne: You mean the protective Biggers

165
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Rhonda. Take your phone and turn it so I can see at least your mouth.

166
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see the decoration ceiling. I want to see more of you, it could put it on the dashboard dashboard was great. I just needed to be able to see more of you, I can only see from here up

167
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.410
Rhonda Towne: Alright, I think that might be better.

168
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

169
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to invite the imagery. One more time.

170
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.170
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I just, you mean the paper you showed me before.

171
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Rhonda. Here we go. I would like you to think

172
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Of an image of a protective figure either real or imagined what comes to mind.

173
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.050
Rhonda Towne: Well,

174
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.020
Rhonda Towne: Not the real would be a lot of the characters I read

175
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And

176
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I supposed to know what you're thinking about right now.

177
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.310
Rhonda Towne: What protective

178
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.140
Rhonda Towne: Would be a lot of the characters. Sorry. That's just what I said.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.180
Rhonda Towne: In in

180
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.660
Rhonda Towne: Would be the person's

181
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.660
Rhonda Towne: I mean,

182
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you state them, can you state them because I can't read your mind.

183
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.050
Rhonda Towne: I mean, I mean,

184
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.280
Rhonda Towne: I read a lot of the paranormal stuff. That's what I'm saying.

185
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:23.790
Rhonda Towne: And then

186
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You

187
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, Rhonda, why aren't you just saying it just say it.

188
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.940
Rhonda Towne: Like as a no horse.

189
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

190
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.600
Rhonda Towne: Yeah I wars, the protective horse.

191
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey protective force and does it. Is there some light size to it color to it, some kind of unique features that really, if I were to bring it back up.

192
00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would invite that imagery, at a time when maybe protective figure might be useful in our work together. How would I describe it that immediately.

193
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have that imagery. See if you can hold in your imagination right in that mind's eye, without horse looks like smells like sounds like everything about it and just describe it to me.

194
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.050
Supposedly

195
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.510
Rhonda Towne: For one, it's his size, he's huge.

196
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.540
Rhonda Towne: Got it here to the average

197
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:31.530
Rhonda Towne: Man, even the, the owner apparently is like six

198
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:42.630
Rhonda Towne: Eight and but the horse is still like seven. I mean, he's taller than the guy who is 70

199
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.210
Rhonda Towne: Uh, but it can fly like Pegasus.

200
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Can Fly. How does it fly because it has wings are now. Yeah. Okay, got it.

201
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.740
Rhonda Towne: And it can shoot fire from

202
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.010
Rhonda Towne: its nostrils.

203
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.850
Rhonda Towne: And just with its own of when it's threaten and can do that.

204
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.730
Rhonda Towne: Okay. His her skin is like razor sharp

205
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: razor sharp

206
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.340
Rhonda Towne: And its wings has, like, how would you say it.

207
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:33.450
Rhonda Towne: Whenever it's written its wings has those metal things that come out. I cannot remember the name of it. It's a weird name.

208
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they like blades and they're like knives and a sharp

209
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.730
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, it just, it shoots out. Okay.

210
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.930
Rhonda Towne: Okay, yeah.

211
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.520
Rhonda Towne: It can through metal, you name it, and cut through mountains.

212
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the lady to cut will just say cut through metal and mountains those wings when they're spread

213
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.370
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, when it threatened mostly

214
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it was threatened. Yeah.

215
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice right now. We got it. Now I can see what you were thinking of. Great. So let's do it again.

216
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing figure real or imagined a nurturing figure, typically what they want for you is

217
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That you grow to your full potential. They want for you, pure and simple no mixed message. They don't want anything back and nurturing for your wants for you to reach your growth potential. Thank you to evolve.

218
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.420
Rhonda Towne: Hmm, nurturing,

219
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.010
Rhonda Towne: I would say

220
00:24:54.450 --> 00:25:00.510
Rhonda Towne: Like a coddling huddling person but not to

221
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.950
Rhonda Towne: Like overbearing in a way

222
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, check a see real or imagined. See if you can catch an image of someone who was cuddling.

223
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But wasn't overbearing Sentra. See if you can catch either real or imagined. Think about books TV, movies, your imagination or in real life. And sometimes it's a blending of a couple people real or imagined. You get the idea. You already did one you did fantastic. See if I can do it again.

224
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.720
Rhonda Towne: Like encouraging.

225
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A real or imagined image. I'm going to write it down when you describe it was. Wait for it. Wait till it gets into your imagination.

226
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.040
Rhonda Towne: I would say one who

227
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.410
Rhonda Towne: One who encourages without overbearing

228
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.620
Rhonda Towne: I'm see hmm

229
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:03.780
Rhonda Towne: I know

230
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.890
Rhonda Towne: Of course, encourages what that he thought were barren.

231
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.830
Rhonda Towne: Then the see

232
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.270
Rhonda Towne: Hmm. That part's hard

233
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with it. You're doing great. I know they're difficult just wait for it can take as long as it takes. It's worth it.

234
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.700
Rhonda Towne: Mmm hmm.

235
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.260
Rhonda Towne: See

236
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.240
Rhonda Towne: The encouraging.

237
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.590
Rhonda Towne: Encouraging

238
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This image wants for you to reach your full potential.

239
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.320
Rhonda Towne: The ones that are encouraging.

240
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They can't be overbearing this imagery won't work. We've got to have it singular right it's got to be no mixed message. They can't want anything back just really pure

241
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever seen it in a movie where you thought wow look at that and wonder what being at the receiving end of that much encouragement. I wonder what that would feel like.

242
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you looked at this movie. We looked at this TV show or read this character in the book and he thought, wow. If only. Wouldn't that be something

243
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.540
Rhonda Towne: Well number see

244
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.620
Rhonda Towne: Integrity.

245
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.530
Rhonda Towne: Would that be

246
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.520
Rhonda Towne: And works.

247
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.740
Rhonda Towne: I mean, for his integrity.

248
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.910
Rhonda Towne: Toward the mean for his being his encouragement.

249
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have

250
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone in your mind right now.

251
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:40.650
Rhonda Towne: See, cuz I know those books that I'm reading right now it's all intertwined.

252
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.880
Oh,

253
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:50.790
Rhonda Towne: Except it's about an angel. Who's freakin millennia old

254
00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:03.420
Rhonda Towne: He is the father. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse step. He doesn't know because he's so disobedient that

255
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:15.210
Rhonda Towne: The angels, like, Where was it Megatron and zeal white because memory because he is so um

256
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.570
Rhonda Towne: You know, and I mean, this will be in the way.

257
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to come back to nurturing figure. Let's move away from that one for a second. I wrote it down. I wrote angel and it's not quite zeroed in on it needs a little bit of refinement.

258
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a sense of their attributes. So you can kind of tell that this, this figure would be encouraging it would have an integrity, it would not be overbearing

259
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It would nurture your personal growth and development, but we don't quite have you don't quite have an image. It doesn't sound like in your mind, yet you don't quite have something you could describe to me, much like what you did with the protective force.

260
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.870
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, he's like this sub union and encouraging in his own way.

261
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.090
Rhonda Towne: So I'm

262
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna come back. Okay.

263
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.550
Rhonda Towne: Okay.

264
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, once got some mixture and for this exercise. I want it singular not mixed this entity wants for Rhonda.

265
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To grow, evolve and develop everything that she's capable of. That's what this figure wants. So we're going to come back to it. Okay, let's let that sit, sit in the backgrounds and on the back burner or unconscious and see what comes up. Let's move to a third one, right.

266
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like you to think of real or imagined a creature figures, real or imagined can be whatever you want. You're going to describe it to me.

267
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a wise figure

268
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:52.950
Rhonda Towne: Out.

269
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: The third one is a wise figure really

270
00:30:59.250 --> 00:30:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise.

271
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.110
Rhonda Towne: Wise. Uh huh.

272
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.060
Rhonda Towne: I'm missing.

273
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.430
Rhonda Towne: My

274
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.060
Rhonda Towne: I'm sorry, could you repeat that again, I'm sorry my thing you want to

275
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Think of a real or imagined.

276
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That sort of reference.

277
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.930
Rhonda Towne: Imagine, think of the wise.

278
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of an image of something or someone wise, what comes to your imagination.

279
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.840
Rhonda Towne: Um,

280
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.080
Rhonda Towne: I always think, are they real

281
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.280
Rhonda Towne: I'm more of a pessimists.

282
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What they what

283
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Are optimists. They tell me what you just saw in your imagination, what was it,

284
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.930
Rhonda Towne: I did three Wiseman

285
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.000
Okay.

286
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. Okay.

287
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so I heard you, and you did sort of clue me in and said you pictured the wise men, but then you wonder, are they real

288
00:32:42.420 --> 00:33:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to picture an animal or maybe something in you ever watched movies or tv where you saw there was an entity that sort of represented and all knowing very intelligent experience wise figure. Does anything come up

289
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.600
Rhonda Towne: TV with the all knowing

290
00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.200
Rhonda Towne: All I can think of is

291
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.620
Rhonda Towne: Like Jimmy Stewart, or whatever. Those profit people

292
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:28.890
Rhonda Towne: You know those people who always want money or whatever they do their sermons and they're like, well, you give a donation.

293
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we want you. You want us because that's a little creepy. I don't trust them personally. So I don't even know if that's a no.

294
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.760
Rhonda Towne: No.

295
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's go back to the three wise and let's visit that one again.

296
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.530
Rhonda Towne: Um,

297
00:33:48.390 --> 00:34:00.510
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I always wondered, like I said, I read the Bible. I read all kinds of stuff I've gone to church. I did the whole everything

298
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:10.980
Rhonda Towne: I mean it's every Bader know I've always wondered, it's just basically that's it. I wondered

299
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I'm probably going to need to revisit these again. You don't sound too confident about these last two. So we're probably going to need to sharpen them a little bit because you're not

300
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: confident about them. In other words, I have this sense of wisdom. I can feel it lands in my bones and I know it's true. That's not happening for you, there's doubt there's questioning

301
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:50.160
Rhonda Towne: And

302
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.760
Rhonda Towne: And I'm not saying I know it all.

303
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.110
But

304
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:12.930
Rhonda Towne: I mean, I read, I don't know, maybe it was my thing going to school. You know, there's I have taken all kinds of stuff. And as you things here maybe as all the

305
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:18.690
Rhonda Towne: Instructors I had that screwed. My, my thinking up. I don't know.

306
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.970
Rhonda Towne: And all this stuff. I read

307
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, we'll come on a different day.

308
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be some clarity about what's a nurturing figure. And what's the wives. Take your you're having to work really hard at something

309
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't need to be quite that hard you're working very hard at it. For most people, they just say this, this, this, this, and they're done. So something's happening. Don't know if it's that you're tired from today.

310
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Or that I'm not doing a great job of explaining it. But we're going to move on and we'll come back to it another day. Okay.

311
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:57.240
Rhonda Towne: Well, the nurturing figure. It could be. I just never had one in my life.

312
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but that's analysis that isn't what I'm asking for. I know, I know, I know why that's that's not what I'm asking.

313
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I

314
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.860
Rhonda Towne: Mean, it could be I'm I

315
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.980
Rhonda Towne: Can be one to my kid.

316
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You. So notice you just caught it, you

317
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you be

318
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A nurturing figure, could you be that maybe it's you maybe after all it's you.

319
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:43.440
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I can be to my kids especially my end. Now that my scenario Burkina at work together since I got him a job. I don't know if I told you that I got my a job that my work.

320
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:53.100
Rhonda Towne: Um, I told you that when he ended up having a bad friend at work. He got drunk.

321
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.850
Rhonda Towne: And so I was like Oh hell no.

322
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:09.840
Rhonda Towne: So I, I didn't really went to specifics of brandy, my boss but I told her you know she needed a Coke. And I said, well, my is available, my son, if you want him.

323
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:22.470
Rhonda Towne: And plus, everything was closing all the bars. So she goes, well he's hired if he wants a job. And I said, All right, this fine. So now I did too, and to kind of thing.

324
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.140
Rhonda Towne: My is there. I keep an eye on him without him really knowing and he's got a job.

325
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.910
Rhonda Towne: So I have him there with me.

326
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:42.930
Rhonda Towne: And he's got a job, but we have different hours but still I know who hangs out with it. You know what I mean, I know who who all there.

327
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.620
Rhonda Towne: But if you need help. I'm there.

328
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.810
Rhonda Towne: So it kind of works out.

329
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I put you in as a nurturing figure I put the self.

330
00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.220
Rhonda Towne: Yeah.

331
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

332
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.120
Rhonda Towne: I just don't know who to

333
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.100
Rhonda Towne: I just

334
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Run on sorry I

335
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:15.840
Rhonda Towne: Just don't know who to buy an Apple. I don't. I never had that in my life.

336
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:16.740
No.

337
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't get this piece of the healing unless we dip into this kind of conversation, and you did great. But notice how hard you have to work right.

338
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this, this has an impact. And so that's why I want to get these figures really clear. For some people, what ends up happening RHONDA IS they struggle, like what you just did right can't find it can't find it, and they start to recognize it and they think

339
00:38:46.530 --> 00:39:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, I see it. I saw it in a movie or hey, I feel it with you. One, they might, for some people end up saying it's me. Like, that's how sparse that nurturing says that I am that I've actually been

340
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I've also been the protector, because I protect boundaries and I make sure people are kind to each other. So there might be that

341
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So, no, I'm not surprised that you had a hard time no i i know i you've told me your stories. None of what you said surprises me. And I'm proud of you for sticking with it and really trying tried and tried and tried and you kept trying kept trying kept trying

342
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I imagine that wasn't a very easy thing to do.

343
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:39.300
Rhonda Towne: Yeah i and I'm just like, and even the stories and Brandi. Brandi tells me about his parents.

344
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.950
Rhonda Towne: Like how cold, his mom and dad were to him.

345
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:52.290
Rhonda Towne: And I'm like, I can do that. I just had dinner. My kids. And then last night. You know what I mean.

346
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

347
00:39:54.270 --> 00:40:10.590
Rhonda Towne: And like I could never tell my kids you know it's you guys are turning 18. I don't know what you guys gonna do. But, you know, you're, you're almost done with school, you're not going to live here anymore, but I don't know what you can do, but you know I won't be here.

348
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's

349
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.160
Rhonda Towne: What I told him.

350
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:15.780
Rhonda Towne: And he

351
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.600
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, he was astounding Atlanta and I'm like your dad.

352
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.510
Rhonda Towne: Oh, God. He was so cold.

353
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.330
Rhonda Towne: So I honestly don't know.

354
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, um, let's schedule something for

355
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Schedule, but I'll go ahead and schedule it and you'll have to sort of let me know whether it's going to work for you.

356
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine you're scheduled between April 27 of may first

357
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And last,

358
00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But

359
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How about

360
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we're gonna try anyway one o'clock.

361
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: At night.

362
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll send a text to you.

363
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can cross check your schedule and see if it works.

364
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.520
Rhonda Towne: At one time.

365
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: 110

366
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.510
Rhonda Towne: Which means one

367
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to set the alarm for 1245 it's taking a virtual clinical really long time to check people in

368
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.540
Rhonda Towne: Okay, April 29 that 1pm 1:10pm

369
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes 10 minutes after 1pm 10 minutes after

370
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.390
Rhonda Towne: All right.

371
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.230
Rhonda Towne: All right.

372
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I sent a message to Dr. Real and just, I just let her know that you were here today, and if there is an Asian. Why then, she knows you are here. Okay.

373
00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:03.180
Rhonda Towne: Okay. So, just out of curiosity is my group every month or because I've been doing once a month. I honestly don't know.

374
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're good. I got sent a message to Dr. Rob real I let her know, You were here. You and I have something scheduled. I'm fine. If you want to go to group once a month. And you're going on Tuesdays.

375
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.660
Rhonda Towne: Yeah, I've been doing Tuesdays.

376
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds good. My guess is she bridged it to today. I'm guessing because she wanted you to be here.

377
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:28.110
Rhonda Towne: I haven't gotten anything yet. Since last month.

378
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:29.550
Huh.

379
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:31.320

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, call bright heart health when you hang up with me. You got to get ahold of her

381
