Dr Jameson: Because this is weird. So if you. I'm going to close this one and give me five minutes and then come back and I'll, we'll see if we have to do it this way we will, but I'd rather at least try one more time.

26
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.940
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I don't think you did. I think it started down south somewhere.

27
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.840
Oh, okay.

Dr Jameson: So,

32
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.520
Dr Jameson: They already explained to you know that obviously you're aware, we're telemedicine and you're comfortable with this, you know, not being in the same actual room together.

33
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.120
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Right.

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:40.830
Dr Jameson: We also record these they get transcribed. We have a transcription service so it doesn't get saved forever. But it does get recorded until that transcription has been created.

35
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.880
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Milk, you're

36
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.910
Dr Jameson: Comfortable with that. Okay, so I got a sort of a message, I believe you're transferring to us from a different program, is that correct

37
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.170
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, okay.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: California and looking to do a little something different because I can't get over there every day and it just was a, you know,

42
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.900
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: It was just hard. It's, it's probably it's at least like 40 minutes away.

43
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.670
Dr Jameson: So gang every day.

44
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.110
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

45
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.930
Dr Jameson: Um, so you're still taking the Methadone currently

46
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.790
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, no.

47
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.580
Dr Jameson: Okay, so when, when did you stop it.

48
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.520
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Two weeks ago. Oh, okay.

49
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.940
Dr Jameson: Did you

50
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:47.130
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, about well, about a week and a half ago, about a week and a half ago and it's taken this long to to get on with you guys. Oh, goodness.

51
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.980
Dr Jameson: So did you just stop, Greg. Did you stop suddenly, are you gradually wind down. I wondered, you

52
00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:06.210
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Know, they just kind of dropped me ages and you know the the gave me the information through bright heart health, and they thought I'd be a good candidate for it and

53
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, I was kind of a messed up situation.

54
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.320
Dr Jameson: So you can't be feeling too fabulously then

55
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.840
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, no, I'm not. Okay. I'm not

56
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.810
Dr Jameson: Have did they give you anything for symptoms or just nothing

57
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.480
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, nothing. Nothing.

58
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.000
Dr Jameson: I mean, we do need

59
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.900
Dr Jameson: People to we

60
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:41.550
Dr Jameson: We do need people to taper down on on methadone and then we usually have to wait longer than maybe some other opiates to give the before we start the buprenorphine. But obviously, this was a little bit

61
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.610
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, right. It

62
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:58.170
Dr Jameson: Over. Yeah. Okay. Well, it sounds like there may be multiple factors. But anyway, um, so. Okay, so tell me you look you look better than I sound like you probably feel, tell me.

63
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.830
Dr Jameson: What your

64
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.050
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I'm sorry, heading and it's a little bit

65
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.390
Dr Jameson: Oh, what kind of symptoms are used.

66
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.590
Dr Jameson: Experiencing now.

67
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:15.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, gosh. I mean, I'm achy I'm irritable I diarrhea sometimes vomiting just

68
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.890
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Like I have allergies. I don't know if I do have allergies or not.

69
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.970
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Maybe I do. But I'm just running noodles watery I name it just not feeling good. Got it.

70
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.730
Dr Jameson: Do you sleep. Okay.

71
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.000
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No.

72
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Usually that I wish I did.

73
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.330
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

74
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.100
Dr Jameson: That's out the window. Usually, okay.

75
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.740
Dr Jameson: All right, and okay so so it sounds like you've got

76
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:57.210
Dr Jameson: I don't know how much you know about Suboxone but does your other opioid does need or opiate needs to be out of your system, or at least dropping. So I think we can check that box off. It sounds like

77
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.640
Dr Jameson: Do you take any other medication that this time.

78
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.170
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I'm it loft. Okay.

79
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.950
Dr Jameson: Do you know what goes here on this.

80
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.120
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: And I think it's like 50

81
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay 52 and then they're gonna hire it 200 or something like that.

82
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.860
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's kind of a

83
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.680
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Recent a recent did it. That's it. Yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.760
Dr Jameson: And anything for birth control. If it's not relevant.

85
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.760
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Now I have it. I had hysterectomies years ago. Okay, well that salsa. Okay.

86
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.540
Dr Jameson: Um, and then are you allergic to any medication.

87
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.070
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, no.

88
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.120
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

89
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.450
Dr Jameson: Besides the hysterectomy. Any other surgeries that you've had.

90
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.550
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No. No. Okay. You still have all your other

SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You know,

112
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.300
Dr Jameson: Prior to stopping the methadone. How was it doing

113
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, not the worst, worst

114
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.110
Dr Jameson: Managing ok

115
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.840
Dr Jameson: OK, and then

116
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.580
Dr Jameson: So you were prescribed the oxycodone

117
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.490
Dr Jameson: Yes, initially and then

118
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.110
Dr Jameson: Do you mean he said everything that happened with the pills like

119
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:08.790
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: They started you know when, like, yeah, like a couple of years ago when they stop you know prescribing them.

120
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You know what I'm saying they just

121
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.980
Dr Jameson: They got really stingy. Yes.

122
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:26.010
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yes, exactly. And then, you know, and then you're out. And then, you know, that's when I start using heroin. I mean, I've done it before, but not like I you know. Mm hmm.

123
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.010
Dr Jameson: OK, and then how are you. How are you using the heroin.

124
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.660
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I smoking.

125
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.500
Dr Jameson: All right. And then when did you transition over to the Methadone

126
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.340
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: About four months ago or so.

127
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.630
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, pretty recently. Yeah, four or five months ago. Okay.

128
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.690
Dr Jameson: And did something in particular, push you to seeking that treatment or

129
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:02.640
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Um, no. Just was feeling bad, and was looking for better options and using

130
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.560
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay. Any like legal issues or family.

131
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.220
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Well yeah, I have legal issues going on. Yeah, but you know, I'm doing good. And and

132
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You know,

133
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.360
Dr Jameson: I on probation or what's the

134
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.160
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yes, I am. Yeah, I am.

135
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.640
Dr Jameson: All right.

136
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, but they all knew about this. That's why they referred me over here.

137
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.500
Dr Jameson: Is not what was I said sometimes this is part of that sort of

138
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.870
Dr Jameson: Package, I guess.

139
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.400
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

140
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. So. So was it a court order thing. Initially, or it was just recommended or

141
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.310
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: A recommended. Yeah, yeah.

142
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:57.840
Dr Jameson: And it usually from what I would what people tell me, it seems like it often does like people that are you know successfully entering treatment and you know staying with the plan tend to be rewarded in general. I mean, obviously, I have nothing to do with

143
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:08.340
Dr Jameson: Those kind of decisions, but it does seem like often times things work out pretty well when for agents that are dealing with that kind of stuff when they're

144
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:19.950
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, you know, it just, it makes it makes it easier through the data. Do what you know you need to do instead of feeling terrible all day long. And, you know, not being able to do anything.

145
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.190
Dr Jameson: Right, and then the court, whoever judges or whoever they they tend to look

146
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.120
Dr Jameson: Positively on people that are, you know, taking the bull by the horns and, you know,

147
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:39.210
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, yeah, I'm trying. You know, I'm trying. And it's not easy, you know, not easy. That's

148
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.680
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: why I'm here.

149
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.170
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, the Suboxone is or buprenorphine. It's a generic, but it's a really

150
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:56.580
Dr Jameson: I mean, it's got mean methadone is is great in a lot of ways to but but it does have some drawbacks, not the least of which is you have to go there every day.

151
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.570
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Right.

152
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.960
Dr Jameson: But this is nice because you can just get it at the pharmacy, like any other medication and it's a lot

153
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.560
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Less so some doctor Jamison right

154
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:15.870
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, okay. I'm just wondering, it might going to be on the Bupa nor friend right that's what I was

155
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:23.580
Dr Jameson: So yeah, that's the same. That's just the generic name for Suboxone is the brand name and

156
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.160
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Yeah.

157
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:39.990
Dr Jameson: And no, that's fair enough, they it's always confusing so Suboxone is a brand name and it's actually a combination of I guess they named it sublingual buprenorphine and the locks own. It's like a

158
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:40.770
Dr Jameson: Soap.

159
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.140
Dr Jameson: Box. Oh, that's how they probably came up

160
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.620
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: With a name.

161
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.460
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Now I get it.

162
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.010
Dr Jameson: I never really thought of it. But yeah, so it's a comedy and then now they have generic so

163
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.370
Dr Jameson: Generally, you know, most of the time the generic being that it's cheaper is what we end up

164
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.740
Using but

165
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.620
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so it's, um,

166
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:09.120
Dr Jameson: It's a different medication, but it has the same general purpose as the methadone, obviously, you know,

167
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.100
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay, yeah, yeah. I've been trying to do my homework on it.

168
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.920
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, well, I usually I just want to ask you. Sorry.

169
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:27.630
Dr Jameson: The zillion questions, but when we get to that part. I usually start by asking you, tell me what you know so that I don't repeat things that you don't know that you already know and kind of pick up where you're

170
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.820
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: How far you've gotten

171
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:47.430
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Will um I do know that it's a the the partial opiate antagonist in it. You know, it has the ceiling effect and you can't take more than you, you know, I'm just, you know, yeah, it's, yeah, all that good stuff. That's great.

172
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.810
Dr Jameson: So did you go on their website they have like a website, you went to or did

173
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:52.410
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You. Yeah.

174
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:53.970
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Good, yeah.

175
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.860
Dr Jameson: And you saw you saw that the way that you take it and have it have it dissolve and all that.

176
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.880
Yeah.

177
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.720
Dr Jameson: Well, great. It's always

178
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.990
Dr Jameson: Helpful to have patients that are

179
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:08.640
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Educated

180
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:14.460
Dr Jameson: Love it. Yes, I love it. I'm sorry. So let me just back up another minute and ask you

181
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.120
Dr Jameson: Several other questions. Do you smoke cigarettes.

182
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.620
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No.

183
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.480
Dr Jameson: In the past or number

184
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.970
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, no, I have in the past, but I don't know if you quit.

185
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.680
Dr Jameson: How about alcohol at all.

186
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.780
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, not anymore.

187
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.370
Dr Jameson: We're not an issue.

188
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.340
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Also, yeah. Yeah, it used to be. Yeah.

189
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.870
Dr Jameson: When did you stop printing

190
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.500
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: And probably a couple months. Oh, yeah.

191
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.640
Dr Jameson: So around the same time.

192
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.910
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, little a little bit yeah okay so

193
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.380
Dr Jameson: It's now march. So you started in like November in treatment.

194
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.070
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I would see October I think October.

195
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.240
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let's say you stop drinking November ish, something like that. Okay.

196
00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:57.990
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah yeah

197
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.330
Dr Jameson: And any other drugs that have been

198
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.060
Dr Jameson: You're in your

199
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:04.950
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Experience. No.

200
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.970
Dr Jameson: No. Okay. Are you working

201
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.770
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, I'm not.

202
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.710
Dr Jameson: Disabled or just not working.

203
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.360
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: It's not working.

204
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.360
Dr Jameson: In the past, what kind of work, if any, did you do

205
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I was actually an elven

206
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.420
Dr Jameson: License that what is that

207
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.150
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Like vocational nurse.

208
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.440
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

209
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.160
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I never heard that particular

210
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.620
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, it's like you know you need another year to be sure to get your Rn.

211
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.580
Dr Jameson: Okay, so somewhere in the same range as an LPN.

212
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.400
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, it's exactly the LPN anything

213
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay. All right, so I'm okay. I'm never heard that particular

214
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, I don't know. It'd be a

215
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.990
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Regional thing and

216
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.370
Dr Jameson: Boring. It's probably

217
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.250
Dr Jameson: That's exactly what I was thinking. It's probably a regional thing. Okay.

218
00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.980
Dr Jameson: All right, well that explains why you're the word words like agonist are running off your tongue like that.

219
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.420
Dr Jameson: She comes

220
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.440
Dr Jameson: Back. That's not the kind of word that people just throw around usually good good

221
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.820
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Out there. Yeah.

222
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:19.860
Dr Jameson: That's good. Okay, so you're currently not working. Is that related to all this, am I supposed incorrectly or

223
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.410
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No, no, it's not. No, no, it wasn't related yeah anything like it. Yeah, okay.

224
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.140
Dr Jameson: And who do you live with anyone.

225
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.080
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, my husband. Yeah.

226
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.230
Dr Jameson: Do you have kids around, you know,

227
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.560
Dr Jameson: The live nearby they in the picture.

228
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.780
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, okay, good.

229
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.890
Dr Jameson: Sorry, this, these may seem like rejected.

230
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.560
Dr Jameson: As you can imagine, there can there can be a lot of

231
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.770
Dr Jameson: Destruction, I guess.

232
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.450
Dr Jameson: Related so

233
00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.430
Dr Jameson: originally went here a lot, you know, there's a lot of

234
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.770
Dr Jameson: Sad, sad situation. Sometimes

235
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.870
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay, so you've been to nursing school. Okay.

236
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.620
Dr Jameson: Your husband's supportive

237
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.080
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah. Uh huh. You see some

238
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.240
Dr Jameson: Was he an addict as well or

239
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.360
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No.

240
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.960
No.

241
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.180
Dr Jameson: How about an alcohol anything any issues with that for him or no.

242
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.140
No.

243
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.020
Dr Jameson: That is good.

244
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.970
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, it helps

245
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.960
Dr Jameson: Yes.

246
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.770
Dr Jameson: To people that are both. I mean, it's nice to have a support, but it kind of

247
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.950
Dr Jameson: Your, your success. Sometimes this

248
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.660
Dr Jameson: Can sometimes be affected by whether somebody else's successful so

249
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.800
Exactly.

250
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.830
Dr Jameson: Does addiction or alcohol issue running your family at all and a family history.

251
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.350
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah yeah it

252
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.620
Dr Jameson: Multiple people just one person.

253
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.120
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Or multiple people

254
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.020
Dr Jameson: Okay. Is it alcohol in general, or both.

255
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.820
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, alcohol, yeah.

256
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.420
Dr Jameson: Alcohol, it's

257
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.940
Dr Jameson: Not necessarily surprising. Okay.

258
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.200
Dr Jameson: How tall are you,

259
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.440
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I am five six.

260
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.480
Dr Jameson: And about how much do you weigh thank

261
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.040
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You 145

262
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.830
Very good.

263
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.790
Dr Jameson: Alright, so

264
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:43.230
Dr Jameson: I think we've established that you've waited long enough so you and you did you read about that to their precipitated withdrawal.

265
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.430
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah yeah

266
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:44.820
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

267
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.400
Dr Jameson: So that's why we were. That's why I was asking those questions. Okay.

268
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.660
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: So, okay.

269
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:58.110
Dr Jameson: Um, well, it doesn't go well if there, if your first exposure to Suboxone makes you feel 100 times worse so

270
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.390
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Surely, don't be on it.

271
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:00.990
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

272
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.550
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: It can China.

273
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.490
Dr Jameson: People almost development version to it. Sometimes it seems like

274
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.250
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

275
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:21.090
Dr Jameson: So it sounds like you have a pretty good idea. I just want to highlight a couple things. It's meant to be a once a day, draw. I mean, the half life is very long. In other words,

276
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:37.560
Dr Jameson: For some reason, our patients generally seem more comfortable, which may be psychological, but whatever. Doesn't matter, taking the medication split into, you know, two or sometimes even three different doses during the day.

277
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.210
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay, right.

278
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:45.300
Dr Jameson: Method on once a day. So I don't know how you feel about just continuing with something once a day or

279
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.190
Dr Jameson: It doesn't really matter.

280
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.600
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, here I'll figure it out, you know, however, I feel yeah you know

281
00:19:51.990 --> 00:20:06.180
Dr Jameson: I think that makes sense. And there are some funny quirky things so you, you already know that you know you really basically after it's about 32 milligrams, but you get pretty close to that, even by 24 milligrams, you basically saturated all of your receptors.

282
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.570
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Right.

283
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.590
Dr Jameson: Nowhere else and that's

284
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.520
Bus the brain.

285
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.120
Dr Jameson: It.

286
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.660
Dr Jameson: Is very strong

287
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.230
Dr Jameson: Affinity is the term we use for the receptor. So

288
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:32.220
Dr Jameson: It once it's in there. It's sticks and it's almost it's very hard to get it out. So if another opiate should somehow show up there's nowhere for it to go either. So that's how

289
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.790
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: It actually then

290
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:46.020
Dr Jameson: Yeah. A lot of times that people. People assume, understandably, that the no oxygen. The Narc can part is really what's blocking, but it's actually not. It's the buprenorphine itself that's doing that and then

291
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.280
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Allow all there.

292
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.500
Dr Jameson: Yeah, the last one was added to this as more of a deterrent to people.

293
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.510
Dr Jameson: misusing

294
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.120
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Get medication. Yeah. So, so, yes.

295
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:11.580
Dr Jameson: Tried to melt it and shoot it or snorted or smoke it or something, then they get the non canon are can actually is not absorbed under the tongue. The way that buprenorphine. Is it really is just passing through you. As long as you're using the medication, the way it's designed

296
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.980
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: To be. Yeah, that's what I was reading too.

297
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:14.820
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

298
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.740
Dr Jameson: So it was more of a diversion.

299
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.310
Dr Jameson: Determine deterrent.

300
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.920
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, well, I would be, you know,

301
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

302
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:36.690
Dr Jameson: So that's, that's, that it can displace other opiates, which is why would cause a withdrawal symptom. If it was taken to sue, which we already sort of decided isn't going to be an issue for you. But I think it's important that you still understand it just

303
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:45.300
Dr Jameson: I think, you know, many of our patients have already tried it. Not all not always by proscription

304
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.710
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: So I think

305
00:21:46.890 --> 00:22:01.890
Dr Jameson: You know, and, and I'm not condoning that at all. Don't get me wrong but i i just being realistic realistic about it. I think I think often, I think it is done with good intention with somebody you know is, is struggling and here try this.

306
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:02.850
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: But you need

307
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:12.780
Dr Jameson: To know I don't want you to do that. But if you were to do it would be better if you knew you know to make sure that it's done properly, making

308
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:13.680
Yeah.

309
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.900
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that we talked about and then it usually works quite quickly.

310
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.160
Dr Jameson: I've seen

311
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.410
Dr Jameson: People literally go in 2030 minutes feel feel whole bunch better so

312
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.660
Dr Jameson: Just to give you some

313
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.500
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Like it, you

314
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:40.650
Dr Jameson: Pope. And then when we start it, which you probably read about do we have these induction. There's different protocols and

315
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:51.720
Dr Jameson: You know, if you're going to be really conservative. You start with a half of a strip and then you wait an hour and see, and then you can add the other half. If you want if you need it.

316
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.970
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Some people say

317
00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.780
Dr Jameson: Some people just kind of guess approximate you know the the very common doses 60 milligrams a day, which is to have

318
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.860
Dr Jameson: To have whatever. So sometimes we just

319
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:22.890
Dr Jameson: You know, decided to start there. I don't feel strongly. I think that's kind of where you're sort of instincts about you know how you feel about this, some people are like, just make me feel better soon as possible. Other people you want to be more deliberate about it. So I'll

320
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.670
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Write

321
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:29.940
Dr Jameson: Kind of open to do that. Whichever way you prefer. But I think what makes sense, is to

322
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.840
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Just start

323
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:42.960
Dr Jameson: You know, likely something like the 16 milligrams will work well for you. So I can write a prescription that would be enough for you to take it that often.

324
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.270
Dr Jameson: Between now and when we

325
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.770
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Get you back but

326
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.900
Dr Jameson: If you prefer to start

327
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.130
Dr Jameson: By taking a half

328
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.930
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: And see how that goes. I

329
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.700
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: You know, that's perfectly reasonable to

330
00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.260
Dr Jameson: So I just have to look you up in the little Pete in a prescription drug monitoring system.

331
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.520
Dr Jameson: So let me what's sorry. Tell me your birthday. One more time.

332
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.540
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Before

333
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.580
You

334
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.270
Dr Jameson: Must be you all Lister

335
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:28.920
Dr Jameson: Done. People have like 77 addresses. It's amazing. Alright, so I just see some Tramadol back in November, which must have been

336
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.270
Dr Jameson: Sort of the tail end of. Did you have a procedure done or what was happening.

337
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.200
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Hey,

338
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.870
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Do

339
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.250
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: They were you going

340
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.260
Dr Jameson: Let me know when it's

341
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.690
Dr Jameson: Safe to continue

342
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.610
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, no, no, it's fine.

343
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:12.600
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I'm

344
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.270
Dr Jameson: So sorry, was the Tramadol. Why was the print

345
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.590
Dr Jameson: Tramadol mean prescribed

346
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:30.600
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: On how gosh I don't know even knows, probably, for I have to take. Oh, that's one thing I have diverticulitis yeah I forget because it doesn't bother me sometimes, you know. It just bothers me in a while. Yeah.

347
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.910
Dr Jameson: So you've had that before. Okay.

348
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.170
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Well, this

349
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.100
Dr Jameson: Is all the time.

350
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:37.770
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

351
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.600
Dr Jameson: Yes. So sometimes people like, Oh, that's right. I had cancer. Okay.

352
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.270
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh my god. Wow.

353
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:54.300
Dr Jameson: Are you just forget that. No, no, no, don't, don't worry. It's fine. It's especially when things aren't really an ongoing active thing. It's easy to forget about

354
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.020
Yeah.

355
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.670
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay.

356
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.960
So,

357
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.390
Dr Jameson: But so i think so, then, did they explain to you how our program is Cyrus structured as far as the weekly groups and then counseling and stuff.

358
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.510
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I'm not really okay

359
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:24.900
Dr Jameson: Alright so let me explain how that works. And so the after this initial meeting we sometimes do a follow up one on one. Just one word really tweaking doses, or if there's if it's complicated, anyway.

360
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.480
Dr Jameson: Sometimes we don't even depends

361
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:40.800
Dr Jameson: Then going forward. You will you and I will whoever's going to be. I think it's would be me. But hypothetically, whoever the doctor whoever's prescribing for you. You meet every week at least to start with.

362
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.250
Dr Jameson: In a group. So it's a combination.

363
00:26:45.390 --> 00:27:02.580
Dr Jameson: Group sort of recovery skills relapse prevention support group with a counselor and then I'm also there to to address. Well, any medical issues or just mostly on there to see who needs a refill and get make sure that gets squared away and

364
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.050
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Sort of do the whole thing.

365
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.220
Dr Jameson: The business side of it.

366
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:13.530
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, I'm also I'm I'm also in counseling already out at my girl help here in San Benito county so great.

367
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.650
Dr Jameson: How long have you been, how long has that been going on.

368
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.100
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: And it's done tember

369
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.510
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

370
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.860
Dr Jameson: Is it helpful you finding it worthwhile.

371
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.980
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, all right, you know, okay.

372
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:41.310
Dr Jameson: So we actually don't this our program does not as designed. It's not necessarily 100% mandate that people do individual counseling. Personally, I think it's

373
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:54.480
Dr Jameson: Sort of short sighted, not to do both because usually, even if it wasn't part of the reason that someone ended up using which often it is there's often things that have now developed as a result of that.

374
00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:06.060
Dr Jameson: That can be. You can use help getting through. So anyway, I would not try to disrupt your unless you weren't happy with your counselor, then we can always offer

375
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:12.420
Dr Jameson: But as long as it's happening I'm perfectly happy for you to continue with what you've been doing

376
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:24.600
Dr Jameson: We do require a single assessment by one of our counselors to like if they call it a bio cycle, social, and they create a quote what they call a treatment plan which, in your case, would probably be

377
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.200
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Continued with

378
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.720
Dr Jameson: Counselor, but I'm

379
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.810
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Trying to understand reflected

380
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.750
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: In here. No, it's not working.

381
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.160
Dr Jameson: Okay, can you raise your battery low you me

382
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.030
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah.

383
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.590
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Down 10%

384
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.090
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Here and I'm boring to okay

385
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.000
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Get it going, oh no, it's okay.

386
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.070
Dr Jameson: Well, let me just make sure we've got your

387
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:51.780
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay.

388
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.760
Is it plugged in. Now,

389
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.490
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, I do. I don't know what's going on with it. Okay.

390
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.180
Dr Jameson: All right.

391
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:00.750
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Well,

392
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.150
Dr Jameson: I'll just make sure we have the we have a lot you

393
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.270
Dr Jameson: Know, yeah, we should be able to wrap up pretty quick.

394
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:06.960
Dr Jameson: And if you want

395
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.730
Dr Jameson: If you want to turn your camera off that won't use as much energy probably

396
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.220
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: And that's okay. I don't know how to do that.

397
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.540
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay.

398
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.140
Dr Jameson: All right.

399
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:16.830
Dr Jameson: Well, so

400
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.270
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: All this up.

401
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:30.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so my system is being super slow right now. So that's not helping. But I just want to make sure I have the correct pharmacy. It says Nob Hill on airline highway.

402
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.040
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: That's correct. Okay.

403
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.430
Dr Jameson: By any chance. Did you contact them to make sure they have supply

404
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.910
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: No I did not. I didn't know I needed.

405
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.930
Dr Jameson: To. I mean, you don't you don't necessarily but but sometimes

406
00:29:47.220 --> 00:30:03.660
Dr Jameson: I guess they're they're sort of a lot at a certain supply each month. And so sometimes we are not toward the end of the month, yet, but sometimes they aren't taking on new patients because they already have sort of the maximum number they can supply with the allotment they get so

407
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.710
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Oh, just

408
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:13.800
Dr Jameson: Just, I would. It's fine. I'll send the prescription but makes just give them a call in a few minutes, and make sure a that they received it and be, you know, and, you know,

409
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.450
Dr Jameson: What my when might be able to pick it.

410
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.350
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Up and sometimes they have to

411
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.270
Dr Jameson: Order it sometimes they're not taking patients sometimes they have questions because it comes through.

412
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.500
Dr Jameson: I don't know.

413
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.660
Dr Jameson: Well, it won't be an issue. Usually in California.

414
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.560
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: But anyway, sometimes

415
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:32.670
Dr Jameson: A different state. So, let us know if there's any sometimes you need a prior off so there can be a fatal.

416
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:33.630
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay that's but

417
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:41.610
Dr Jameson: I'll send the prescription and then as far as my California groups meet on Wednesdays primarily

418
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.420
Dr Jameson: Or is your schedule tight.

419
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.050
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: On what time

420
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.700
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: What time on Wednesday.

421
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.050
Dr Jameson: So we have a 10:30am and noon.

422
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.740
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: I would probably have to do a noon, because I of course every Wednesday, I might, you know,

423
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.360
Dr Jameson: That's it. So I'll pencil you in for that one.

424
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:09.240
Dr Jameson: We ask you to check in about it. You're just going to start in virtual clinic, just like you did today.

425
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.680
Dr Jameson: And we asked you to

426
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.240
Dr Jameson: Start Checking in

427
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.870
Dr Jameson: At least half an hour early just to make sure everything gets sorted out before the

428
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.080
Dr Jameson: Actual start time. The only other thing I'd

429
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:30.990
Dr Jameson: Like to ask is, we require headphones. When were you in the group setting for HIPAA purposes. It's not so much of an issue when

430
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.340
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: It's just you and me. Okay.

431
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.750
Dr Jameson: But, but other people are saying we don't want transmitted around to your neighbors or whoever's

432
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.460
Dr Jameson: Whoever's Welcome back.

433
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.560
Dr Jameson: So if you can just play having fun.

434
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.660
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Now, I understand that. Yeah, so

435
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.390
Dr Jameson: If you can plan on having some headphones on Wednesday.

436
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:46.920
Dr Jameson: So,

437
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:57.630
Dr Jameson: I'll send a prescription for like three days worth so that you have a little cushion and then we can double check on the dose on Wednesday and make sure everything is going. Okay.

438
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.070
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Okay. All right.

439
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.020
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Thank you.

440
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.900
Dr Jameson: You're welcome. I want there. I always feel like there's something else. I'm missing but

441
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.190
Dr Jameson: I know you're worried about your device crashing or dying.

442
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.450
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Yeah, probably.

443
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.050
Dr Jameson: Any questions for me that that you can think of about

444
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.210
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Right now not yeah anyway. Okay. Yeah.

445
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:35.310
Dr Jameson: I mean, there's a film and there's a tablet and I. Some people seem to not like the taste as well for one than the other. And then some people, it's the other way around. So I guess I'll start with the film, but

446
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.920
Dr Jameson: If your insurance cares and wants to use a tablet. Then we'll, we'll see good money anyway but

447
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.160
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Whichever yeah okay

448
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:52.440
Dr Jameson: And we can try the other one. Sometimes people find one cause of nausea and the other one doesn't. Or this one gives me a headache. And I wonder, you know, so sometimes we play around with it.

449
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.470
Dr Jameson: I'm going to make the

450
00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.870
Dr Jameson: Prescription one film twice a day if you

451
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.010
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Like I said, if you want to start with.

452
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:11.970
Dr Jameson: A half if you want to take them both at the same time once a day that's perfectly fine, too. There is a funny little. That was what I was gonna say there is a funny.

453
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.930
Dr Jameson: Work with this particular medication.

454
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.450
Dr Jameson: It does help pain.

455
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:31.020
Dr Jameson: But it works better for pain if it's split into smaller more frequent doses than if you take it all on today so that if your back is an issue that might be a reason to consider at least letting the dose and

456
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.090
Dr Jameson: Sometimes people do.

457
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:33.480
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: Even

458
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.010
Dr Jameson: Like four doses, a day so

459
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.220
Dr Jameson: You can you can play with that but

460
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.750
SAMSUNG-SM-T337A: OK. OK.

461
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.460
Dr Jameson: So I

570
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.700
Dr Jameson: So she would have run out of medication.

571
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.000

572
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.640
Dr Jameson: She has not returned

573
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.090
Dr Jameson: And has not responded to multiple attempts to contact her

574
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.670
Dr Jameson: She's therefore just charged for lack of participation.

575
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.790

576
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.820

578
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.500
Dr Jameson: Actually the visit was cut off, just before conclusion and

579
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.820
Dr Jameson: A PRESCRIPTION FOR Suboxone was never sent

580
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:23.220
Dr Jameson: As we were trying to reach him to confirm pharmacy and confirm dosing schedule. So he actually never

581
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.900
Dr Jameson: Received a prescription for Suboxone from us. He

582
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.980
Dr Jameson: did not return any calls and did not attend any groups. So he's

583
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.530
Dr Jameson: Discharged from the program this time.
