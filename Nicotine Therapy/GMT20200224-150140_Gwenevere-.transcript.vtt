00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.540
Jaime Crouchet: JD Christian. I was supposed to be at work right here, right at nine so

2
00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right. You can't in here. So, um,

3
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I probably won't remember but let me just get the concept

4
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your insurance coverage for you because I know everybody has to sort of manage their finances around their program.

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Depending on

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If people change jobs or their insurance benefits to their organization will change over time. What's, what's your situation. Just bring me up to speed. So I'm confused.

7
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
Jaime Crouchet: I have an $8,000 deductible that I need to meet before

8
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: crieff

9
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.680
Jaime Crouchet: Right. It's so not even worth it. I'm going to opt out of I've been looking around for different insurance. I'm going to opt out of this one at work.

10
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.180
Jaime Crouchet: Okay. Crazy.

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.800
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, really cover anything medication anything

12
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's just that's insane. I mean, you might as well be paying your own insurance out of, like, ya know,

13
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Row. So, who's your company. What's your United Health at now.

14
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:23.760
Jaime Crouchet: So I don't know if I should call them and see if maybe they have a different plan, but I have been shopping around for other ones but but that's just crazy. I can't. I can't.

16
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.610
Jaime Crouchet: I can't keep doing it. I miss group I miss doing this every week, you know,

17
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, we were making some good progress.

18
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm okay. All right. And so what is what's right heart health. What do they want from you in order to attend sessions. What's that sort of agreement, you have with them.

19
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.910
Jaime Crouchet: I just make the payment.

20
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.890
Jaime Crouchet: Time that I can

21
00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And so until, until that changes, did you work out with Dr. I braille that you'll go to group because I think that's probably the more expensive service because you're paying for to to physicians, you're paying for the physician and me.

22
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.490
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, so it's one

23
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.730
Jaime Crouchet: So it's 105 for group and 64 one on one.

24
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So, or you're going to did you work out with Dr ariela plan going once a month to group.

25
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.450
Jaime Crouchet: No, no, I haven't. I've only talked to you about it. I don't know.

26
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty if you

27
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty sure should say yes.

28
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.690
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, so

29
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right at the end. Are you going in tomorrow.

30
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.910
Jaime Crouchet: It's a group

31
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.930
Yeah.

32
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.270
Jaime Crouchet: Possibly

33
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.990
Okay.

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you if you're on a medication, you may want to because then you can you can say, hey, Dr brielle can

35
00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Speak with you and what have you, right at the end and then you can bring it up and I'll be there. And I can say, you know, clinically. I think she's capable of doing it and sort of help in that endeavor until you

36
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then it's more affordable. I mean, yes, I want you in group to but if it means

37
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to drop out of the program either so

38
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.480
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah I don't either, so

39
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So think about that. You think you can pull it off tomorrow or no.

40
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's if you think about it like it might mean that you don't have to go for a month, you could think of it like, all right, divide that by four.

41
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.740
Jaime Crouchet: Could it be well i get i get i get paid this week, so I can definitely go to group next week group and one and one next week.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.730
Jaime Crouchet: You want to just have to. Yeah, I just need to read that sit down and write out my budget for that, I think, you know,

44
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you won't be here on 25 you want to do.

Gwenevere Abriel: Say one more time.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.870
Jaime Crouchet: I said, and hopefully she can feel my meds for today. I haven't had a dose and Saturday.

76
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What, how did what's been going on at that happen.

77
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.980
Jaime Crouchet: I'm just an idiot.

78
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:08.520
Jaime Crouchet: So when I went to the airport Saturday and I put my badges up on that thing. So I fly southwest and the first two bags that are 50 pounds and under are free. Well, my bag was 60 pounds.

79
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:18.510
Jaime Crouchet: So it's taking out all the heaviest things and my bag of shampoo you want you can replay shampoo. But I had my strips in there too and I didn't realize that. So it was only a couple

80
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So you through you threw out a couple strips.

81
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.250
Yeah.

82
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:34.470
Jaime Crouchet: I swear I have my my purse. I always have them. My first, but I didn't even think about it was just so chaotic at the airport, I just was taken out the heavy stuff and

83
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.890
Jaime Crouchet: When I got home, I was like, oh my god.

84
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.230
Jaime Crouchet: Um,

85
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get into your notes here are

86
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.350
Covered in

87
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to concentrate today you okay right now.

88
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.640
Yeah.

89
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.710
Okay.

90
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.610
Jaime Crouchet: What's going on in life in general but

91
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.630
Jaime Crouchet: Like I'm okay.

92
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so what are some of the challenges you're facing. Let me in there a little bit.

93
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.170
Jaime Crouchet: So,

94
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.490
Jaime Crouchet: I I applied for the Cherry Creek position in Denver.

95
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.130
Jaime Crouchet: Um,

96
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.580
Jaime Crouchet: But I feel like my boss is making it a little bit difficult. So I don't know.

97
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.660
Hmm.

98
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:32.670
Jaime Crouchet: She um

99
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:42.660
Jaime Crouchet: So when I came back home this weekend that bought that regional my boss up there. I told her she asked me if I wanted to come back.

100
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:51.270
Jaime Crouchet: And I said, Yeah, definitely. I mean, we've been making great momentum. This last month this hotel is turned around our scores have gone up by 30 points in a month.

101
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.200
Jaime Crouchet: Wow, our revenues up by a couple thousand dollars a day.

102
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

103
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:05.730
Jaime Crouchet: It's been a huge change. And I told her I just wanted to keep that momentum. So I would love all all managed remotely here if she could have another GM stop by periodically long gone.

104
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:16.650
Jaime Crouchet: And she was on board with other things. Great. She said, I'm a good fit for that place. So just hurry up and put in my application. And so when I got back home and I was telling my boss about it. She said, No.

105
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that

106
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Like likes you to do everything for her that one. Yeah. Because what she's doing again.

107
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:36.510
Jaime Crouchet: Well, so she and I told her I told her, I'm just going to manage remotely until I can come back and she's like, well, you can't go back till after on the other side of conference which is March eight,

108
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.260
Jaime Crouchet: Um, and I said,

109
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:52.290
Jaime Crouchet: I said, Well, I'm just going to manage remotely and have a new another GM stop by and she said, No, you can't do that. You don't want to be responsible for a hotel that you're not even sure you're going to be working at

110
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:09.780
Jaime Crouchet: So that definitely bothered me. So I called that regional there and told her what she said. And I said, she plans on calling you tomorrow. So I just want you and I to be on the same page. I want to be there. And I want to help and I want this job right.

111
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.650
Jaime Crouchet: And she said, Okay, well, we'll just see what she has to say.

112
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:21.030
Jaime Crouchet: So, at the same time. All this is happening, my landlord, who I've been renting from for five years.

113
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.920
Jaime Crouchet: Gives me a notice her son's coming back from college and she needs the house.

114
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.440
Jaime Crouchet: To be packed.

115
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: find time to move. I don't know where. But there's a sign coming your way.

116
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.610
Jaime Crouchet: Right.

117
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:47.040
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, so, so I don't know whether I should be looking for a new house here in Denver or what. And then in the midst of all that Greg and I broke up a couple weeks ago.

118
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.870
Jaime Crouchet: How

119
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You say it so casually. How did that affect you.

120
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.530
Jaime Crouchet: It's

121
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.260
Jaime Crouchet: It's, it's, it was okay. The first week, but the last week has been really hard.

122
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:10.050
Jaime Crouchet: So, I mean, we were together for five years and not one morning or one night. Did he miss with a good morning and good night text.

123
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.840
Jaime Crouchet: At the very least, and so that's when I feel it is that night in the morning when I don't

124
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: For a mutual decision.

125
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.320
Jaime Crouchet: I just, I feel like I caught him lying to me and I don't know why he would lie.

126
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:40.710
Jaime Crouchet: So he told me that he was going to draw others to cartel members that escaped from prison and so he had to go to Chihuahua and investigators

127
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.580
Jaime Crouchet: And he told me that he's like I there's, I won't be on here, very much.

128
00:11:49.200 --> 00:12:01.140
Jaime Crouchet: It's international rates. So we can't talk. You know, like we always do. Right. And so because his phone as a government phone, you know, very rarely use each other's phone numbers we use an app.

129
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.550
Jaime Crouchet: We use an app that can't be tracked on his phone.

130
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:15.540
Jaime Crouchet: It's kick that we use and a while ago, we used to use this app called Hangouts and on Hangouts. That tells you when you're online. And when you're not

131
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.330
Jaime Crouchet: So I was sending him a couple messages.

132
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.800
Jaime Crouchet: And

133
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:32.340
Jaime Crouchet: It was on Valentine's Day. Actually, that I never, I didn't hear from him at all and Valentine's Day, and the two days after. So I was starting to get really worried about him and I'm texting him and nothing back

134
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:40.350
Jaime Crouchet: So then SOMETHING TOLD ME SOMETHING TOLD ME to just check that other out. I get on and sure enough, it shows that he's active on that app.

135
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.040
Jaime Crouchet: And so I sent him a message on the app.

136
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:54.540
Jaime Crouchet: Saying I cannot believe that you're just going to let me sit here and worry about you. I don't hear from you on Valentine's Day. And he just so he replies.

137
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.240
Jaime Crouchet: He replied to me saying

138
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.180
Jaime Crouchet: Saying he was on there talking to his daughters, and he can't be on the phone lines out there.

139
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:10.170
Jaime Crouchet: And I said, but if you're on there talking to your daughters, you know, I'm at home worried Fick like I'm in tears worried that something happened to you.

140
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:24.090
Jaime Crouchet: I'm worried and you have the opportunity to fix that for me and take that, take that away from me and you choose not to. Why are you lying to me. Are you telling me that you can't be on the phone when you can clearly you can. I can see your active right there.

141
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.590
Jaime Crouchet: And he just offered no explanation after that.

142
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:41.730
Jaime Crouchet: And so I'm sold buying it. I mean, if I'm not worth an explanation. And if I'm not me. If this isn't worth even talking about or anything, then fine, whatever, do your thing. And I'll go my way

143
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.260
Jaime Crouchet: And he hasn't tried to reach out since

144
00:13:47.760 --> 00:14:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So that seems like maybe you were onto something and and that was it just a coincidence on Valentine's Day. He disappeared, like that. Typically I know it's a hallmark thing, but sometimes people like in past years. Was that something you guys found a way to sort of celebrate

145
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.960
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, we did.

146
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so does that seem odd that it would happen on that day.

147
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.430
Jaime Crouchet: I think that

148
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:26.460
Jaime Crouchet: Well, what I think is that he did get busy on that day okay i i do think that I do think that maybe he didn't respond to me. The two days after because he knew I was gonna have a problem with that.

149
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:36.930
Jaime Crouchet: Because if he I mean Valentine's Day didn't sneak up on us. He knew when he was going to draw off. He could have we could have done something before he left.

150
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.900
Jaime Crouchet: I don't know, I just I just

151
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:48.480
Jaime Crouchet: I feel tired of being the person to fix everything and put everything into this and he just gets to sit back and

152
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.510
Jaime Crouchet: And hide behind his work.

153
00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is familiar in the beginning. Then there was a he came out and saw me, then we're okay. We're okay. We're okay this is sounding like way, it sounded right in the beginning when you were letting me and a little bit about that relationship.

154
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm tired of it. It's one way. Um, so there was a moment when you started to invest and does it seem like it just reverted back to he's not really investing in the relationship is am I hearing it correctly.

155
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.950
Yeah.

156
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're tired.

157
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:30.810
Jaime Crouchet: I am and I literally have begged him to just say something and he just doesn't he very rarely talks about anything.

158
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.720
Jaime Crouchet: anything important

159
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So as you get more familiar with getting in touch with your own thoughts and feelings right you through therapy and wherever else

160
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Your confidence around it is getting bigger and bolder and maybe you're starting to expect a little bit more from him and he he may have reached a wall where he can't do it. I don't know.

161
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But that is not uncommon for people right that are sort of working on themselves is their tolerance for whatever they were tolerating before starts to disappear, they're not willing to tolerate things anymore.

162
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't know. I don't know if what got reacted in you was

163
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see like really right because I'm not in the relationship. Only you know

164
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you feel done you have

165
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You done or if he did a big I'll fly out and see you

166
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.300
Jaime Crouchet: But it feels

167
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we'll go back and we'll go through this again.

168
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.840
Jaime Crouchet: I feel like if he

169
00:16:49.920 --> 00:17:00.210
Jaime Crouchet: If he tried if he came to me and and wanted to fix it and do it hurt me. And we hurt each other and we worked on it. I feel like I was

170
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:11.430
Jaime Crouchet: At the same time, I'm not going to reach out to him. I'm not running to him. I'm not going to him. I mean, it's in hit the ball is in his court that he doesn't do anything with it and whatever and find there too.

171
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you said you feel like to

172
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.800
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I do.

173
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking to his daughters, and he was

174
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.290
Jaime Crouchet: Saying to you. I can't talk right okay

175
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's got no no story about that right

176
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:29.670
Okay.

177
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So if he came to you and explained why, and it seemed reasonable, rational, that would be a big, big effort on his part.

178
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.100
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

179
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: See work for the FBI or something.

180
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.070
Jaime Crouchet: Yes.

181
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.500
Jaime Crouchet: It works for da

182
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.140
Jaime Crouchet: So I know that he's not an emotional guy I know that

183
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.490
Jaime Crouchet: Emotions are, it's very clear emotions are uncomfortable for him.

184
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.010
Jaime Crouchet: But

185
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.060
OK.

186
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

187
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, I don't know if this will feel good timing or bad timing. I don't know.

188
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:14.880
But

189
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: He sounds a lot like the emotional availability of your mother.

190
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And

191
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I may have told you

192
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a whole relationship therapy approach the motto relationship therapy out there that it would probably really your job would probably drop because you'll be like, oh,

193
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so weird. WE WOULD THINK MY MOM, DOESN'T SHOW. SHE CARES in a DNC way we'd be like, I'm not going to be with someone like that.

194
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.040
Jaime Crouchet: Mm hmm.

195
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: No, we, we, be like, just like that. We pulling in, just like that. And you go, what am I insane. Why would I do that.

196
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not insane. This

197
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurt this effective

198
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: ruptured relationship that you have with your mother. It sticks with you. Me him her all of us right steps.

199
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to heal. We want to meet it and feed different fields different we want this other which was originally mom will play this theory out becomes Greg.

200
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And we are loved me enough

201
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Love me enough to care about me.

202
00:19:51.030 --> 00:20:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So we pick someone that has typically it's a lot of the negative attributes of our caregiver if there was a rupture in the relationship we fix them when we're not conscious. Don't get mad at yourself, totally unconscious

203
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That will do the same thing to us so that we can heal so that we can re experience. Right. Well, we didn't get when we were younger.

204
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Most times because this other person isn't in therapy or and and nobody knows what's going on. They just piss us off. They let us down and we are wounded again and in not just a little way but like the big way. Like we were a kid.

205
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard. And so we have this one. And instead of this is just we don't go on this guy. Want to turn, you know, hey, I don't like him. We don't we say

206
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, is something wrong with me. I'm unlovable, because it feels like that big one. When we were a kid, but it's it's if you stay on conscious of it.

207
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very possible Hilton truck somewhat just like it again.

208
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't say I'm so sorry.

209
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But

210
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just

211
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just we want to heal. We want that same kind of person to heal us to be the one that says you're worth it. I'm going to just put my crap aside and I'm going to be there for you. And I'm going to show you

212
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just weird. The way we work. I'm not saying that's what's going to happen.

213
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just happens a lot.

214
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.100
Jaime Crouchet: It makes sense. It does make sense.

215
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's very thing that just just you're tired of it. He's emotionally

216
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: He won't put your first, you know, there's a and it's probably pretty similar to your mother's just completely unavailable.

217
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.230
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

218
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:54.480
Jaime Crouchet: It may, it may, I mean, it makes sense. It does make sense. I was. I mean, I was very comfortable with that man very comfortable.

219
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Distance you ever

220
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

221
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.850
Jaime Crouchet: Oh,

222
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your comfort. You're familiar with that much systems.

223
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:11.820
Yeah.

224
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.950
Jaime Crouchet: You can tolerate it.

225
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Many people would be like, and no

226
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: See house floor right

227
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.710
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

228
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's at night and in the morning. So what do you, what are you doing to address those times because it does get risky risky those relationships.

229
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: They can be triggers for a will screw it, you know, I don't want to feel sad. I don't want to feel lonely.

230
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing, you've got to amp up the coping skills part, you got to bring it up a notch. What are you doing,

231
00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:00.510
Jaime Crouchet: Nothing, nothing, just avoiding it and just kind of trying to hurry up and get my day going to avoid up

232
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've got work, which is nice in the morning, but I think we got to talk about the evening.

233
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.880
Something yeah yeah in there.

234
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

235
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there friendships that you have neglected to ask people out. Spend time

236
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Planning least maybe Monday through Friday, having something kind of plugged in, whether it's a gym to yoga every week, I'll go try a new activity, even though you may say, I'm going to hate polities you go anyway because it fills that our

237
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be tired, you'll be distracted in physical movement or having sort of some playdates with friends. What do you think

238
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.270
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I do have a friend that's wanting me to go to the gym so

239
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:58.380
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, we could we could do that she can take me to her gym for free with her once a week, so

240
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: At least getting through these next couple weeks is probably going to be so, so, so important.

241
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's me saying that

242
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How concerned are you about those evening, because you're getting a text in the morning and you are getting one in the evening. Right.

243
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I of course can send you something, but I don't know that it would get

244
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The same feeling

245
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.390
It might. I could certainly

246
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Have for people but but you pay attention to you. Okay. How significant is this evening text that you are getting from Greg. Be honest with yourself is no point seven

247
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:59.220
Jaime Crouchet: I do think it's really significant. All I can think of the last week is just hurry up and find somebody else in my life to distract me

248
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.620
Jaime Crouchet: All I think about

249
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, and, you know,

250
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically, this might be a time for me to say this part, typically in recovery when people are really work in a program. They don't even date for a year.

251
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:16.860
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

252
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So you get a cactus, you get a plant, you get a cat, you get something to take care of.

253
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you, you see how you do with that.

254
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You have so much variability. So let's let's let's analyze that just a little bit. Let's go. I want to hurry up and fill it.

255
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Without someone to fill that

256
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your self talk. What's your belief about yourself. What are you thinking inside your head. What do you what's going on in your head.

257
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.120
Jaime Crouchet: What's wrong with me.

258
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I had someone without will tell me there's nothing wrong with me.

259
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.530
Okay.

260
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So now.

261
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I was talking to you about your ego and the motto is all the positive and negative attributes of your mother and father

262
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If those are the people that were your primary caregivers. It's different for everybody. Yeah.

263
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If my hypothesis is true.

264
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that there's something wrong with you.

265
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.840
Jaime Crouchet: I don't know.

266
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.850
Jaime Crouchet: Like there is my if I can't even get my mom to love me.

267
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.170
Oh,

268
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.940
Amy.

269
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.580
Jaime Crouchet: Feels like

270
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And who is she so if that's

271
00:26:53.790 --> 00:27:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's what you're doing with yourself. That's the irrational thought, I'm glad you're saying it out loud because at least we can we can challenge it a little bit, then who she loving

272
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on pushy, loving, she's so great at loving she's isolated you and she's just not loving you, because there's something wrong with you, who she loving

273
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.930
Jaime Crouchet: She's much better with my siblings.

274
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.080
Jaime Crouchet: She has a relationship with my brother and my younger sister.

275
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And they say I agree with that. They say, yes, it's good because your sister sent you a friggin book.

276
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you but I also heard you. So which one

277
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.700
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah sure that they're not the best relationships, but I do. I feel like I see her attempt with them.

278
00:27:53.340 --> 00:28:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: She's texted you to, what does it look like with sister. I'm gonna check in and see, see how how accurate this is

279
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.690
Jaime Crouchet: Probably my sister putting in the effort. No, my mom.

280
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if the what's wrong with me. Even my mom won't love me. What if that is

281
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: An old network. What if that's from very, very long time ago.

282
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're feeling it with right see my sister, they're struggling with her. She, she probably has no clue how to love herself.

283
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And is struggling and when your father was there. He filled that void. He knew how to do it and probably Ted and tell her behind the scenes quite a bit, get it together.

284
00:28:49.380 --> 00:29:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So that stuff you were doing earlier. Although so glad you said it out loud might fall in the category of this is what a little girl might be saying over simplified.

285
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong with you.

286
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish your mother could say this is my shit.

287
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I literally can't. I can't. I see you meeting, I see you told me, these, these wretched horrible things I can't hear it. I can't help. I am I, I'm stuck.

288
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not a value assessment of you. I wish she had the capacity to do that, unfortunately,

289
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.460
Jaime Crouchet: You're going to know I would believe her. I wouldn't believe that

290
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But she can't see that either.

291
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes insight that takes self awareness, the whole point is, she doesn't have self awareness. So you if you're asking the impossible. So in here.

292
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're with me.

293
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever experienced yourself feeling wrong.

294
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.120
Jaime Crouchet: In here with you.

295
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.210
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

296
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

297
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:34.560
Jaime Crouchet: Well, I mean, I guess wrong in a good way. Like I feel like I am wrong by thinking that it's it's me that I'm invaluable. Okay.

298
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't so I'm really careful with with these words of right and wrong. I'm asking it to see a fast what you're doing with it in my world view.

299
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Little girl little Jamie. What she did was

300
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to control her environment, she sees the behavior of a parent and intuitively right

301
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared. She, she's all powerful. Maybe she'll take care of me, she'll see me, she'll hear me. How does she not see me and hear me well i will i can't blame her because she's all powerful. That's what a parent is I'll blame myself.

302
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm bad, I'm wrong, I can have some control here.

303
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's old, old, old not wrong, little girl did the best she could with

304
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit. But I just did the very thing you do that. I just copied you that's so funny. I don't really do.

305
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't wrong you you had an adaptation you adapted to your environment. The best way you know how

306
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Many people do this, this is where shame gets developed, there's something wrong with me.

307
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.720
Okay.

308
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: No, she did the best she could

309
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your environment failed you.

310
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It sucks.

311
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And

312
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to get you

313
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Shifting cut negative thinking. We've got to break that out. We've got to get in that negative network part around what's wrong with me.

314
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one I want to work on.

315
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're back in your room. That's the one I'd like to do the MD around. That's a big one, because that there's freedom there.

316
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong with you, you simply don't like Greg's behavior that's you saying I don't like it. You could never do that with your mom, you could never say I don't like an amount because you were tiny

317
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. You have a right to your preferences to your boundaries and tolerance and as you grow and change.

318
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Your expectations of the richness of what you want from a relationship may change if you're right, because I in the beginning I was talking about how this embargo can get reenacted in our, in our romantic relationships. If right now you're saying

319
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. Now, I don't know. So what do you want in a relationship. Do you want someone living with you that is calling you and let's go to lunch and I'll meet you for dinner, and I mean how much contact do you want

320
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:33.960
Jaime Crouchet: I mean, yeah.

321
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:40.650
Jaime Crouchet: That's the part that worries me. I guess because I do want that kind of relationship where we go out and do things, but

322
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:53.730
Jaime Crouchet: Too much emotion is uncomfortable for me. It's too. It's just uncomfortable. I think that's why i mean it's been five years with Greg, but I've been doing this with him, and it was comfortable

323
00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:00.840
Jaime Crouchet: But I just, I've had boyfriends that are too emotional and it's just uncomfortable and I don't like it.

324
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you're not the same person you were in those other relationships, the more skills you you get around setting boundaries, being able to get in your mind.

325
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This person's emotional and having this phrase. Is this a meat problem or a him problem that's a problem. I'm fine. Today I can offer some listening. I can kind of listen a little bit, but ultimately this other person needs to work it out now.

326
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of that phrasing. Is this me problem when we're with a fuser someone that tries to fuse with us.

327
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to be really clear with our boundaries, but you can, once you learn that skill, then you can be around people that are emotional and I don't have to take care of them. I just set my limits and I get to find out in real time, will they take care of themselves.

328
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But the tricks that you didn't have before that you and I can continue to build or your boundaries. You have a right to say, I don't like this. I don't like that. I need to spend some time refueling in my quiet space being alone because

329
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Introverts tend to like to refuel on their own. They don't go out and party they want to kind of get centered in their own selves and then they can be refueled and then engage with people again.

330
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

331
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.930
Jaime Crouchet: Am I an introvert, I

332
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.010
Probably

333
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's around that refueling typically is right around in there. Some people want to get out how to socialize. Then I'll feel better for some people.

334
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They write for you. It's probably I'm going to pull in the in my quiet, nice and quiet feel better. And then I can go out into the world and connect with people that tends to be one of the sort of trademark pieces of introvert versus extrovert.

335
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people think that I am an extrovert.

336
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm big

337
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll actually when I have a choice for refueling i'm gonna i'm going to go quiet. And so you would, that's why.

338
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know based on what you what we all see out when everybody's out already, you know, unless you say, you know, is this where you feel better. And you're like, No, I had to really get myself together to even come out tonight, kind of thing.

339
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, it points to nothing wrong with you.

340
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did was adaptive. It's just if it means that that's a five year old solution.

341
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we you kind of maybe want to add more and so that you're not making sort of decisions as a little girl. We want to make some include new skills include all of this knowledge and wisdom that you've accumulated over the years.

342
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't you don't realize that you still have a lot to learn to. I mean, or I have a lot to offer whether you decide to learn it or not. There's still a lot of work to do.

343
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Around your I will call it a window of tolerance around emotions so you know how you're saying now what I can't tell out here is when you say, Oh, I like these emotional people, but I don't know is

344
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I feel responsible for all those emotions, which is a boundary issue which I just talked about. So I don't know if it's that or if you end up feeling it again a boundary issue I'm too empathetic. I just get wiped out around people's emotions. Right. Or if it's they

345
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You

346
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Wishes it

347
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't tolerate them in yourself.

348
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see them in another. You take the blame people are blaming you, you say, Yes, that's true. And now I'm feeling these emotions. I can't tell what it is.

349
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: How many more about being around emotional people, like, give me an example. This so and so did doesn't such and this is what I did give me a little story.

350
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:28.800
Jaime Crouchet: I feel, I feel like on a like an everyday regular basis, like with my staff, you know, I've dealt with staff coming in and crying and

351
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:39.450
Jaime Crouchet: And I feel like I'm good at being there for them. I've never heard otherwise from other people. It's when it comes to romantic relationships when there's too much. I just can't do it.

352
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what's the see what are the he's doing, like, I don't

353
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.530
So, so

354
00:38:48.120 --> 00:39:02.250
Jaime Crouchet: So like with my ex husband, he would want to like be touching me all the time like cuddle all the time and sit there and talk about how much he loves me and why. And that's uncomfortable for me. I don't want, I want you, I want to know you love me, but I don't want to talk about it.

355
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, what's the cuddling and okay expression of. I love you.

356
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.330
Jaime Crouchet: If it was less

357
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cuddling. Um, maybe once a week, once a day, what we're talking about.

358
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.580
Jaime Crouchet: Just not all the time.

359
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

360
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not telling anybody might as well tell me

361
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:39.870
Jaime Crouchet: Like we can lay in bed and fall asleep cuddling. That's fine with me. But to sit there and watch TV and just cuddle all the time. Every time we're sitting on the couch is just too much.

362
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, do you think there's something wrong with you.

363
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.950
Jaime Crouchet: Yes, I do. Yes. Yeah.

364
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So then what happens is, now it's like, I don't want to be around this kind of person, which you don't quite get is, there's nothing wrong with you. This is your preference.

365
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.830
Jaime Crouchet: Plenty of people

366
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Out there, like the same thing. You've got to honor that. And you're going to know when you're dating, right, you're going to know because they won't have that fusion that smothering always always always always touching

367
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you say there's something wrong with me. You might repress that and not tell this person.

368
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of like to just, you know, sit here with my own bowl of popcorn and my own soda and you're over there. And then we connected the end of the day, that's kind of how I am a if that's not enough might want to talk about it now.

369
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing wrong with you.

370
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See, that's just a preference and it's amazing that you know what many people can't even identify what that is.

371
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.890
Jaime Crouchet: I just feel bad, I guess, in the end, like my ex husband would make me feel bad about it so

372
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was, but you would you didn't have me in your life, you probably would have heard me say, Yeah, try this on.

373
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: sending him problem. He's not getting enough affection or sending me problem. That's a him problem I've been like this the whole time. And I told him this is how it is.

374
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Work it out. I'm going to go live my life but that isn't what happened. You took it on

375
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you did as a little girl as blame and you're the problem. He didn't make you you didn't have the skills of boundary and resilience to be able to, in your mind, the self talk that's necessary to be able to have that inner voice going

376
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, how much longer going to take us. Oh maybe I sent a message that I was more affectionate than I am. I got on that.

377
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you can own a little bit. You see,

378
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.150
Jaime Crouchet: Right.

379
00:41:51.360 --> 00:42:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How much is true, but the whole Nigella the one, it's your fault. Now, the new skill is let me see how much of that is true for me that's the new phrase. That's the new one.

380
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear what you're summarily calling me whatever, but I'm going to spend some time thinking about what you said and see how much of it is true for me.

381
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference.

382
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:14.970
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

383
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't make you feel anything out of habit you have taken on more than your fair share of blame.

384
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And created right already talked about that adaptation you did when you were little. It's familiar to you, habitual and you do it probably automatically

385
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I think the more you learn, you're going to have more sort of awareness and consciousness of your tolerance. This

386
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like this. I don't have to feel bad about it. I don't like it. This is my preference, I need to find someone that kind of likes their independence and then once in a while we get together and play.

387
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we're independent we get together and play independent get together and play.

388
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

389
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: He did you know that that making you feel peace. That's where the change can be in sort of inside your head that voice being

390
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I do have some choice. I can either take this accusation on in total, or I can see just a tiny bit of what he's saying. The rest of it is all his that's not mine. You see,

391
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.380
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That does make me feel better. Good. Oh.

392
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can work in all kinds of places. Oh boy. Does it work at work to

393
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Let even with a boss, right, what you're saying is so important to me. I'm going to see how much it down. I could really take a look at. Now I switched it up a little bit.

394
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I played with words, a little but if you're looking for congruency if you think it's possible to talk to someone like that at work and you say, I'm going to take a look at that. I'm going to take a look at

395
00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're talking about. But in your head, you might be doing the switch to what I'm saying, which is I'll see how much of that is true for me. I ain't gonna look at the whole thing.

396
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can say out loud, is the thing that gets them to show should stop yakking about it, but we can look we're all take a look at this piece, what you're talking about. It's really important. I'll take I'll take a look at

397
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're what you're saying. I'll see what I can do, you know,

398
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But the whole blame thing is problematic. It's so unlikely that we're 100% of blame.

399
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly an

400
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Inner personal dynamic

401
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah,

402
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.160
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, that makes sense. That feels better to hear that.

403
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.390
Yeah.

404
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.480
Jaime Crouchet: See, that's why you gotta keep coming to your week

405
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.450
Jaime Crouchet: It just feels better.

406
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because we're doing to yourself.

407
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.600
Jaime Crouchet: Was painful because it

408
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Was probably shame activating

409
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong with me.

410
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're the problem you're wrong. So that's a whole personality, a character assassination and member of the distinction between shame and guilt, it's

411
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's freedom to own your little part if you're a little part is this. I'm making it up, but just

412
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's this. Yeah. I wonder if I drew Greg in

413
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing unconsciously, that it would end up ending, like this, like, I love the distance, but then the very thing that I loved was the thing that pissed me off. Hmm. Oh my gosh.

414
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I did that unconsciously.

415
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It see it. The very thing that we didn't finish off.

416
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can own. And if you can get your power back you can get your sense of agency back by owning the tiny bit.

417
00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because now you're not a victim you participated. And I think that's exciting. The irony that being guilty is liberating and empowering you think that would have the opposite effect, but I just agree. I think when we can sit with what did I do here.

418
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we do it again. Well, maybe I'll do it a few more times just to make sure this grammar is not completely off the rocker

419
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Monkey drawing and people like that.

420
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you like what we're talking about.

421
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Throughout the day when you start to have what's wrong with me and you try to blame yourself, try this other piece on

422
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: With Greg WONDER WHAT I DID TO DID NOT. WHO I AM did get to behavior because that that has solution. And I wonder what I did here.

423
00:46:43.860 --> 00:47:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: To send the message and reinforce that what he's doing is acceptable to me and tolerated it for years didn't speak up. I don't know if that's true, but if it is that's where you can grab your little tiny point 00 1% get your power back

424
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.750
Jaime Crouchet: What

425
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you think maybe some part of it.

426
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have reinforced somehow. I know you're not didn't mean to.

427
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:26.220
Jaime Crouchet: But because I did, I did talk to him. We have talked about this a few times throughout the five years and I just accepted his answer.

428
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.320
Jaime Crouchet: Is the answer is I do, I do care about you. It's just my job. Okay.

429
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.190
But

430
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you like is you don't want to hear about. I love you want to feel it intermittently.

431
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You need we needed to seal it. And so when he showed it you felt it you flew out you felt it.

432
00:47:47.910 --> 00:48:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And so maybe the reinforcement was I'll accept this. But what I wanted was this go away because you want the physical cuddle intermittently, and not just the

433
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:06.360
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah.

434
00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When people follow through with what they say they do get a lot more credibility. I happen to agree with you on that one.

435
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I mean, so maybe your part was sort of tolerating

436
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The I care statement when it wasn't backed up with an expression of I say of I care.

437
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.450
Right.

438
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So how does it feel to sit with that.

439
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:43.050
Jaime Crouchet: I just feel stupid. Why did I put up with it for so long.

440
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:52.590
Jaime Crouchet: Or just, I mean, I feel, I feel good about the situation. I'm grateful that I got to talk to you about it, but I just, you know, I don't get why I would do that.

441
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Even with that you could borrow this philosophy of the motto that we drag along with us.

442
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:05.850
Jaime Crouchet: Yeah, I mean, yeah, it makes sense. I mean, I hear you. And it makes sense. And I'm scared to death that I'm going to keep doing it.

443
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:12.330
Jaime Crouchet: Because, but it just sounds so stupid that we would treat our

444
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.240
Jaime Crouchet: Unconscious, yeah.

445
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't believe in the unconscious is a real challenge.

446
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.130
Jaime Crouchet: Are you

447
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You do. Okay. Okay, good. Its job is just self preserve take care of you always kind of keep an eye out for threat out there store information frontal apart executive functioning organizing use that a lot at work if fan contingencies planning all that

448
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all in service to you at no point throughout the day. Go to I'm stupid. I'm wrong.

449
00:49:53.100 --> 00:50:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go immediately as quickly as you can use thought stop and say, I understand that got me this far, but it may have meant I've missed out on some things I want to do this other thing. Let me just get into

450
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't know what I hadn't learned

451
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

452
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't know

453
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you know, sometimes it becomes a matter of getting a routine in place of these learned information and skills, but you can't give yourself a hard time for something you hadn't learned yet he just now are learning it

454
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.050
Jaime Crouchet: I tell my staff that almost every day you don't know what you don't know.

455
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know what

456
00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

457
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But you it's goodness and for the self to

458
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:43.470
Yeah.

459
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me see. Today I needed to have reviewed any of your goals and we just kind of jump in here and see

460
00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:52.800
That

461
00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Level and then we already worked out a plan of individual therapy it 10 on March 2 group on March 3

462
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.480
Jaime Crouchet: I just look at your

463
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Goals real quick before the hour ends here.

464
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Third,

465
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:19.620
Jaime Crouchet: Over

466
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: On that

467
00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:22.230
Jaime Crouchet: Okay.

468
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me something.

469
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What is important about today for you what came up that was important for you. What's your takeaway. What did you notice important for you.

470
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.630
Jaime Crouchet: That there is, there's

471
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.690
Jaime Crouchet: That

472
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:55.920
Jaime Crouchet: I would feel like I was making adult decisions with my child mind still and that it's not it's there isn't anything wrong with me. I am subconsciously making these decisions.

473
00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:06.870
Jaime Crouchet: And that I am attracted to that and it makes sense why. Yeah, it makes me feel a lot better that that I feel like there's this. There's nothing wrong with me.

474
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.240
Absolutely not.

475
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And additionally, just to review it is a strong invitation that you spend some time really fallen in love with yourself. Again, or if ever before.

476
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you invite really work this this recovery program, get some real confidence behind it. Because then when you meet someone.

477
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're like, oh, I recognize this stuff. I would normally have fell for this person, I would have put up with it for seven years. I could see myself. You know what I'm gonna have to go ahead and say no.

478
00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:50.850
Jaime Crouchet: Sorry.

479
00:52:51.540 --> 00:53:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your confidence is going to be that much stronger, you will be that much further into recovery at that point and kind of continuing to taper.

480
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a very common piece just like don't start romantic relationship change people, places and things, these are pretty fundamental in the first year or so.

481
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So. Give it, give it some thought when those I'm I'm lonely thoughts come maybe maybe today don't give it more than five seconds. Real quick text your friends say, let's go to the gym.

482
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because as soon as you text it you just put a constraint out there and you kind of have to follow through them because you invite someone

483
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.360
Right.

484
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So that, that's working the commitment piece like once I invite someone I gotta follow through with it. So give that a thought you're worth it in the evening okay to take care of you and I'll see you on Monday.

485
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.470
Jaime Crouchet: Okay, thank you. Okay, bye.
