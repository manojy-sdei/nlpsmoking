00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.540

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.179
Richelle Direny: You know, our nation.

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.680
Richelle Direny: In times of struggle we see the true greatness of the American con we are seeing that a lot of people are talking about it.

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.260
Richelle Direny: We're at 141 countries from what does it tell. Sorry about that.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.620

9
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.810
Richelle Direny: Really

10
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.740
Richelle Direny: The weather.

11
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.880
Richelle Direny: Is really bad, bad

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.560
Michael Hudson: Bad for my Australia.

Michael Hudson: What snoring just rain torrential rain all night and I pulled out till

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.390
Michael Hudson: This morning, about eight o'clock show

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.270
Richelle Direny: Wow you what's up and let me send you to it. Again, you have your own company, right.

Michael Hudson: Transport for Amazon to the post office their prime there overnight stuff.

17
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.470
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you guys are busy now with

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.720
Michael Hudson: Well, we are for time being I mean

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.670
Michael Hudson: You know, people are just yakking replace thinkers martial law, and it's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
Michael Hudson: Or your there by going nuts down there. You're on the beach. Right. I mean, same

21
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.170
Richelle Direny: Morning someone you will. Yeah. Now they're threatening because the Spring Breakers guess a lot more young people because of the spring break a lot more young people are going out to the beach, like they don't really care.

22
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.410
Richelle Direny: So they're starting to end at bat I guess a curfew. And if you're at the beach, because of the fact that you're only supposed to be in small groups.

23
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.170
Richelle Direny: There are showing ton loads of people at the beach. So because of that, they're really going to be given out fines or something of that nature.

24
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.940
Michael Hudson: Weekend right

25
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.250
Michael Hudson: I believe last week in a minute.

26
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.800
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And then I saw someone sent me something saying that

27
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.940
Richelle Direny: They like it was the longest train I've ever seen with all of these military tankers on the train coming down here to Florida in Fort Lauderdale.

28
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:35.610
Richelle Direny: So I'm like this is really serious and not to say, you know, not to minimize that this is not real, or what have you, but I mean I'm just like, what kind of virus does this

29
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.690
Michael Hudson: Was around last. Do you remember last fall when they were having the flu season and they said there was a strain of flu that was here, that wasn't

30
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.270
Michael Hudson: Vaccine

31
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.200
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

32
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.750
Michael Hudson: So this same virus that was here last ball.

33
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.500
Michael Hudson: And it was cold and 19 and this whole thing I don't understand. But I've never seen anything quite like this way. It's all coming together and it's all phone, you know,

34
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.390
Michael Hudson: Don't you know there's so many ways this could go

35
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.610
Michael Hudson: You know, but I don't

36
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.940
Michael Hudson: I'm not panic and I'm not, I just really just thinking, it'll stop when it stops. I don't know what they're doing. I think they're inactive or practicing what i don't think i mean

37
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.910
Michael Hudson: A lot of guys that I know are thinking as martial law being practiced to see how it will take to take the ever need to use it.

38
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:36.240
Richelle Direny: You know and I, you know, and I, I'm not one to follow politics. I don't necessarily really try to because to me it's just all confusing. Some of it. You put a lot of it. You question.

39
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:47.550
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I just, I have no clue what they're doing. And, you know, honestly, honestly, Michael, you can't put nothing past the government. I'm sorry, I just have to use nothing has been

40
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.550
Michael Hudson: fully agree. I watch it just about every day just to try to keep up on a hobby of mine, and it's just the biggest

41
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.300
Michael Hudson: In my own opinion and I've been watching this all the since he came into office. I'll watch about an hour day, and

42
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:13.770
Michael Hudson: I think they tried three times and put them out of office, it couldn't succeed. So now they're given the last attempt right before election day, because that's how badly they want him at office. And that's just what I think that

43
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:28.320
Richelle Direny: Will you know what this is my philosophy, you know, like at this point you you know it is what it is. There are certain things you have no control over. And depending on what you believe you know if if he supposed to be there.

44
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:38.760
Richelle Direny: I guess it is what it is because there's nothing you can mean you said we think we have the power to do things, but it goes to show how little power you have one

45
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.660
Little

46
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.910
Richelle Direny: Little power.

47
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.370
Richelle Direny: People think that they're also powerful, but you really truly have a little power to the bigger picture and then

48
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.230
Richelle Direny: You know, people put crucified, other people. Oh, it's because you didn't want. No, no, no. It's like, Come on now. Like, we're always left scratching our heads saying, I really don't understand what just happened.

49
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:13.650
Michael Hudson: So the club in the whole United States that club right there to biggest corporate office business that's ever been around the longest one and they're not going to change it. They're all just doing what they do and

50
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.910
Richelle Direny: They're doing what they do. But this I you know what, honestly, I

51
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.390
Richelle Direny: You know, like I've been telling people in groups and what have you. I said, you know, we are in a crisis.

52
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.820
Richelle Direny: Occurred crisis that we all are scratching our heads and saying something about this whole thing doesn't make sense. But we are in a crisis.

53
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:41.940
Richelle Direny: It is our reality. The question is what are you going to are you going to allow the crisis to make you

54
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.320
Richelle Direny: Do irrational things make irrational decisions do things that make no sense for your own personal self.

55
00:05:50.070 --> 00:06:01.740
Richelle Direny: And that's literally kind of where we are. It's like think about now is the time to stop and think to yourself, if they're going to mandate, all of us to quarantine ourselves in our homes.

56
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:18.750
Richelle Direny: Are you prepared to be able to do that. Can you do that. Do you have enough food. Do you have enough essential items to be able to stay locked in your house for two to three weeks or however long that may they force you to do that.

57
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.920
Michael Hudson: China was two months.

58
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.810
Richelle Direny: I know

59
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.370
Michael Hudson: I know I locked down. Yeah.

60
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.920
Richelle Direny: That would make anybody start climbing out of their skin. I know personally

61
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:38.640
Michael Hudson: Always. You can go with it. I mean, I don't understand. I don't, I'm not. I'm just going to keep on doing what I do, until I can't do it anymore and then

62
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.120
Michael Hudson: The six feet rule. I get it.

63
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.580
Michael Hudson: Went to buy a pizza last night and they gave us a roll of toilet paper with the pizza.

64
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.310
Richelle Direny: They gave me

65
00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:00.690
Michael Hudson: Twitter closed all the restaurants. You can't buy anything in the restaurants here. You can't sit down and eat so they wrote a toilet paper and a ball a hand sanitizer with the pizza. That was your bonus

66
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.610
Richelle Direny: Wow.

67
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.960
Michael Hudson: I mean, it was a joke.

68
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.820
Richelle Direny: And that's where we are. But you know what, but you know, it's so, so there's the philosophy, where

69
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.790
Richelle Direny: I think it was in the group. The other night like now I start closing out the groups with, you know, well,

70
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:25.980
Richelle Direny: You know practice your hygiene, washing your hands. And I said, you know, the reality of it. We're all panicking, but this is our reality.

71
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.160
Richelle Direny: This virus and whatever is going on right now is not telling you to do anything out of the norm.

72
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:48.210
Richelle Direny: It's not some new unforeseen like oh I don't know how to do these things, like what is no it's just telling you you should be washing your hands. Anyway, you should be practicing proper hygiene, all of the things that you should have been doing every so it's kind of like

73
00:07:49.260 --> 00:08:01.020
Richelle Direny: Like you say your, your wife, she you know has medical issues you her doctor's office calling and sending you emails and saying, oh, now we're sanitizing the place. Now, my question is, so you're telling me all the time. He wasn't doing it.

74
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.080
Michael Hudson: Now you're saying after the fact. Correct. I got just

75
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:11.340
Michael Hudson: A few guys at home right now there didn't take they took off, they left me working seven days a week and I are guy was harder work.

76
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:22.980
Michael Hudson: Seven days a week, because one of them. I'm calling Bubble Boy he remember the judge about the movie. He was in the bubble. I just told him that this morning. I said, I'm gonna buy that for you for Christmas. You got written. Put your feet down run around like

77
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.580
Michael Hudson: He took off right when it happened, but his girlfriend or wife has asthma.

78
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:38.430
Michael Hudson: I understand. I've got one here. So when you tell me something like that, you know, there's not much you can tell me it's going to affect me and make me think that it's that big of an emergency.

79
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:47.310
Michael Hudson: You know, I understand something happens, but I get it, you know, and I gotta respect it and it's not. I can't judge anybody just point

80
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.560
Michael Hudson: This guy turned out to be the biggest germ of both Franco that I've ever met my life greatest worker I've ever had. But

81
00:08:53.370 --> 00:09:06.900
Michael Hudson: I swear, I don't know, you know, but you don't know people until something like this happens. And I got my other people are loading up of ammunition. They're not around me. I mean, they're getting their stuff together plywood and, you know, ready to lock down on the next

82
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.850
Richelle Direny: Slide, which means I would

83
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:15.570
Michael Hudson: Bring up their house because they're afraid people are going to come in and start trying to get into their house to get their food, and he's prep or people

84
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:32.070
Michael Hudson: The lady out by the place where I work at the Speedway that sees every Amazon driver is telling everyone that the National Guard's being deployed to shut the airport down and lock down the airport and lock down the roads and so every driver and Amazon thinks

85
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:42.870
Michael Hudson: That they're, you know. She knows what she's talking about because her son to the National Guard. They waited till five o'clock last night for the stopping like those people have waited for them. The world and that day.

86
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.150
Michael Hudson: Love whatever time it didn't happen.

87
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.820
Richelle Direny: It happened a few years ago, like it like it was like six o'clock in May. And I'll never forget the month was man, it was like six o'clock the world supposed to end. And I'm like, Okay.

88
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.680
Michael Hudson: Amy, what time you can get can get the lottery, but they can pick out what talk a little bit and

89
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:06.480
Michael Hudson: When I'm walking around last night. Everybody still there nobody mentioned that part about the National Guard being there and how big of a deal was. But these people. I don't know what it is but I

90
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.210
Michael Hudson: They call me at night may just talk because I got an inside grip on what's going on with the people I know out there.

91
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:22.680
Michael Hudson: It's like the militia, you know, they rant rave rant rave. And this is just all turned into the biggest you know it is what you make of it is all I think I could be totally wrong.

92
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.470
Richelle Direny: I mean, I definitely agree.

93
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:33.150
Richelle Direny: I mean, like you said, you want to respect everyone and, you know, at the same time, you know, trying to help someone makes sense out of nonsense.

94
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:41.040
Richelle Direny: It's that you want to your are you going, you're going to follow everything that you're being told, you're going to be as cautious as possible, especially

95
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:53.640
Richelle Direny: Like, like you said, you have a wife at home who has medical issues. You don't want to put yourself in harm's way, because at the end of the day, are you really going to be truly practicing practicing social distancing with your spouse.

96
00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:00.570
Richelle Direny: You know you can. That's not that that's not possible. You cannot practice social distancing with the people in your home.

97
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:15.210
Richelle Direny: So then, therefore, if you have to go out to work every day you are going to be mindful, you are going to be in tune of what's going on. But are you going to act over the top. It's just like, that's where kind of, you have to pick sense out of nonsense. You're not going to

98
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:15.930
Michael Hudson: Be everywhere.

99
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.070
Michael Hudson: People are everywhere, whether it be this or something else. There's only that person.

100
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.020
Richelle Direny: Yes, there's

101
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:32.280
Richelle Direny: People just need a reason to. It's kind of like my thing with like when people go and start right it's, you know, you just needed a reason to go do what you already wanted to do.

102
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:41.610
Richelle Direny: You just needed a reason. So somebody gave you a reason. Now you're leaving your job to go do something. No. No, you shouldn't have done that so you know it's

103
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:52.500
Richelle Direny: Be mindful. Just be careful. It's, you know, really, and continue to do what you are naturally supposed to do before the virus during the virus and after the virus, you're supposed to be doing it anyway.

104
00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:12.420
Richelle Direny: And it practicing your own self care is really also what's very important because I think where the other piece of it where I can see for a lot of people depending on where everyone at with their own mental stability. Their sobriety and everything else. You also have to

105
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:21.600
Richelle Direny: Practice your own self care because being locked up in a in a home or isolating yourself and shutting yourself off from the world can

106
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:30.000
Richelle Direny: Have an impact on you mentally and emotionally. It really can put people in depression if you were depressed before this can do that.

107
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:38.700
Richelle Direny: If you think especially their people that are losing their jobs or work is cutting back and really not knowing where your source of anything is coming from.

108
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:50.970
Richelle Direny: So there's just so much that can just spin out of that. And for me that's just kind of what I look at, and that's what I see. I mean, am I going to panic. An act like that. No, like, no.

109
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:59.160
Michael Hudson: You're already set up for this because you're working home. You got the video already going on, you're not having to go home and learn how to set all this up. You already got it well.

110
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.290
Richelle Direny: I can I can I just let me just tell you a little secret. I know, I work outside of my house to

111
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.160
Richelle Direny: Do

112
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.330
Yeah, so I

113
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.490
Michael Hudson: Think

114
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.250
Richelle Direny: Either way, either way. I mean, I'm in an office right now. I'm actually in an office right now.

115
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:32.430
Richelle Direny: But then, you know, I go home. I have a child at home that has medical issues as well. And so therefore, just like you. I have to be mindful, not just now, but always, you have to be mindful of what you do, because of, you know,

116
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.220
Michael Hudson: Exactly.

117
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:48.630
Richelle Direny: She has an autoimmune. So for her a regular flu can be bad. Not just this a regular person who comes in sick and coughs on her and she gets sick, it can have an impact on her.

118
00:13:49.170 --> 00:14:02.760
Richelle Direny: So this during and after I still have to be mindful of what it is that I do. So therefore, I'm not going to, you know, be over the top in anything that I do.

119
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.300
Richelle Direny: I learned years ago that

120
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:17.760
Richelle Direny: From someone that did microbiology who studied who, you know, I don't know if you know when you were in school. They used to have these a car in science class where they put things on a car, they tell you rub the door knob and rub different things.

121
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.250
Richelle Direny: Put it on a car and you put it in an autoclave. And you see what grows on it and you

122
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.690
Michael Hudson: Say yes.

123
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:34.170
Richelle Direny: And so they tell you to do it on your hand just so you can see how much bacteria is on your hand and it shows you all these different bacteria that's just even on your hand clean and unclean.

124
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:44.430
Richelle Direny: And they still show you like they're still something that grows. So it tells me that naturally. Our bodies have we have natural bacteria that's honest that's there to protect us.

125
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:55.770
Richelle Direny: Now if you go over the top with all of this hot. If you really truly go over the top and you're using a tub of hand sanitizers all day. What are you doing, you're opening up yourself.

126
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.940
Michael Hudson: lowering your defenses.

127
00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:08.520
Richelle Direny: You're lowering your natural defenses and what's going to happen. So now you're going to blame all the current of know, technically, you did it to yourself when you started going over and above what the whole cleaning of yourself.

128
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.580
Richelle Direny: Because you you you toward on your natural defenses.

129
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:24.870
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I was telling a friend yesterday. I said, you know, you keep doing what you're doing now your real issue is, you're gonna have your long it's going to start collapsing, simply because of all this chemical you're breathing in from cleaning the place. So I sent you.

130
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.230
Michael Hudson: Did your grandmother, keep the bacon grease up on the stove.

131
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:42.360
Michael Hudson: In the bat on the cheese that you sold at school. And that turned into the bacon grease holder. Right. And then the fried chicken on Sunday would stay out till Monday we ate that when I was growing up, and not you know it was a two day rule I

132
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.380
Michael Hudson: Yes, I believe that that prepped me for this day.

133
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.210
Michael Hudson: Off.

134
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:55.770
Michael Hudson: You know, the way you put it in perspective, especially with what you got going on what you just told me with that situation at home.

135
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:07.650
Michael Hudson: An emergency is to you and I are emergencies. The you know their way up here, it has to be up here for me to call an emergency, because I got I've been through one through nine. It's got to be a tag and

136
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.960
Michael Hudson: It just freaks me out to watch this stuff. I don't feel like I'm smarter than anybody. But I just feel like I

137
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.490
Michael Hudson: You know, calm down. Just relax you

138
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:26.850
Richelle Direny: I think everything we go through in life. We are we are faced with different challenges personal challenges that like you said it prepares you for

139
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:35.280
Richelle Direny: Something like this where you say, yeah, it's not to the point where I need to panic. It's this is not really to that point. And even if

140
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:53.790
Richelle Direny: I think I've been through more where I can say it's still, I don't need to be panicking, not the way because in this panic, you tend to start spending money you're already struggling financially. Now you're spending. What you really don't have. It's kind of like now.

141
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.060
Richelle Direny: What, why do we need so much toilet paper.

142
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:10.860
Michael Hudson: I didn't know. I mean, I go through. I honestly, I'd be quite honest, the case in my own bathroom. I use it for months and months. My mother. The other side is a daughter. You know, I don't get it. And I'm I played

143
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.830
Michael Hudson: I get it. But, you know, the bad thing is the work the business is all shutting down here.

144
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:27.180
Michael Hudson: You know, that's going to be the bad thing and I feel bad for the food industry, my daughter was working a second job. She's got a job at Kroger's, and she's working in the food industry as well as she was training.

145
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:36.720
Michael Hudson: And they shut the company down. So I'll carry out now and her fiance is the manager of the place, and they've shut him down to carry out or so.

146
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:44.340
Michael Hudson: And the guy took off work. I'm like, what are you gonna do for money in three months, maybe you have a lot more money than I do. But I got a three or four months supply that I can get to

147
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.570
Richelle Direny: And

148
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:52.320
Michael Hudson: I don't know. You know, he just went like immediately when all this one down, and it's but that's the only thing I see is going to be the

149
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.630
Michael Hudson: Physical part of it, you know, with the financial end of it, it's going to be that's going to cause a problem.

150
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.720
Richelle Direny: In that in that scene. That's where

151
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:11.400
Richelle Direny: I think I know from for me. From a clinical perspective, that's where you look at, and you just say like, what's the inventory, you're doing for your own self, you know,

152
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:24.270
Richelle Direny: Because financially, like I can see the backlash of what is this going to cost you know they're already talking about like a big recession, you know, like I heard the President, the other day talking about a $1 trillion stimulus.

153
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.360
Michael Hudson: Dollars. That's the budget that. But now, today we're talking

154
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:33.690
Richelle Direny: As a trillion dollars that when bush was in office, wasn't it like a 700 and something billion.

155
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.510
Richelle Direny: Where we got a trillion dollars from

156
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:48.270
Michael Hudson: Well, I think Clinton came into like it was enough to go from the Earth to the Moon and dollar bills. If you recall, it was $1. That's how much that was when Bush Senior left or whatever it was.

157
00:18:49.470 --> 00:19:03.180
Michael Hudson: Just not gonna do anything there. They give everybody 1000 or 1500 dollars and you know I know what that does that. That doesn't pay my mortgage. Honestly, I'm not, you know, it doesn't one month what what what are people going to do. I mean,

158
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:13.950
Michael Hudson: I don't think that's the answer. I think I don't know what the answer is. I think they got a problem. And I think they created this problem. I think the day they did this. But the government did by

159
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:23.400
Michael Hudson: Where they put everybody now they got to figure out how to handle it and I don't know how you can do that with all the business going out of business are going to come back. Some of them are going to come back.

160
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.400
Michael Hudson: People watching job permanently. They're not professional you know like what you do for a living.

161
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:38.310
Michael Hudson: So your, your vital, but some of these non vital job servers and restaurants and things like that doesn't mean that they're not important, not just me.

162
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:48.330
Richelle Direny: In how are you going to bounce back from that man. And I thought about that. I thought it was thinking about that. It was this morning or last night. And I'm like, you know, all of these businesses closing now.

163
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:56.040
Richelle Direny: Wow, there's some dogs that was just like, how do you bounce back from that, like, how do you bounce back from that.

164
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.580
Richelle Direny: But I mean, overall, I think, you know, everyone does. Like I said, it's a personal inventory as to

165
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:11.910
Richelle Direny: Sitting down and really looking at the next, you know, let's start off with the next month in comparison to the next three months.

166
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:21.930
Richelle Direny: It's thinking about, you know, what am I going to do just in my short term goal in the next month. What is my clan, um, you know, so

167
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:39.810
Richelle Direny: It. That's really what you have to think about, you know, just for your own peace of mind your own emotional, mental stability. Sit down. Take pen to paper and really consider what do you do in the neck. What, what, what, what is my plan for the next month. If it is that they order nationally

168
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:55.950
Richelle Direny: For the, for the nation to really shut down for all 50 United States for us to all shut down their quarantining us if they do that, like, what exactly is the plan. And I know you say your, your wife has the beginning stages of dementia.

169
00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:07.830
Michael Hudson: Yeah, she's words the stroke. She had, she passed to die out in the house here a couple times and a paler back and then she was down in a coma and she also talks and it's like a 15% of the minimum

170
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:25.080
Michael Hudson: Neither motor function because you can still drive like a mug and get their vast and she's anxious, she can't calm down or filter is gone, and it just people she just 100 miles an hour. And you can see the wheels spinning. She just can't ever calm down anymore just

171
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.150
Michael Hudson: So like even

172
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.020
Richelle Direny: For you.

173
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.580
Michael Hudson: If it is that they are

174
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:37.470
Richelle Direny: If they say like, okay, so you have to be home for two to three weeks. I don't know. You don't have young children at home right

175
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.300
Michael Hudson: Now she's raising our

176
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.180
Michael Hudson: Kids are gone. Okay. Okay.

177
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.060
Richelle Direny: Okay, so, so it would just be you and her in the

178
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.780
Michael Hudson: Home.

179
00:21:45.840 --> 00:22:01.800
Richelle Direny: In your house. So like, even for her. If you had to be home for two weeks, three weeks or a month. Would that do you think that will raise her anxiety or is she fully aware of what's going on around her like is that increasing her anxiety.

180
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:02.910
Michael Hudson: She didn't

181
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:12.570
Michael Hudson: Know what we have three different levels here. So I have a level. She has a level we meet in the middle. And I go back to my level is perfect.

182
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.580
Michael Hudson: In a bad way.

183
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.050
Richelle Direny: That I get you.

184
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.880
Michael Hudson: 22 years. That's how you do it.

185
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:28.860
Michael Hudson: I don't think it'll cause or I mean if it gets worse and it affects her being able to get in the car and go buy something season.

186
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:36.210
Michael Hudson: And new things to buy stuff and centered around the house and skin tags on it since minimal stop. It's little stumping

187
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:52.770
Michael Hudson: You know, there's a bunch of that she does your hundred bucks. She goes, benign, one should be calling you to get the dollar is like I'm $1 over so that will bother. I think that's what we'll call her. You know, if their daily routine or what she wants to do.

188
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.570
Oh, it's changed.

189
00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:07.530
Richelle Direny: So, are you prepared for that because it could possibly change in the next few days. It could change a lot where she is not going to be able to go out, because now they're saying if you're really out

190
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:22.650
Richelle Direny: I know here at my, you know, primary employer if they do tell you if we're out and about, we have to show them a letter saying like, if they're asking you, like, why are you out, you have to show a letter to say why are you out and not home.

191
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:34.530
Michael Hudson: Of your yet so I didn't know. Yeah. How would you explain that. I mean, Home Depot plumbing issues or stuff like that the store. I'm sure you have to do a letter. Every time you go out. You got it.

192
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.410
Richelle Direny: And sometimes some some employers like they put they have some companies prepare for that, where they give you something.

193
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.580
Richelle Direny: Telling you, it's kind of like here in Florida, we have like in during Hurricane Season, depending on your role and what you do.

194
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:57.150
Richelle Direny: If you had to have to go out, you will show and they will always they will allow you to do what it is that you need, like if you need to go to work, they will allow you

195
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:06.690
Richelle Direny: So they have checkpoints and if you have to go through that checkpoint, then you will say, hey, this is my badge. This is where I'm going. And they will allow you to go

196
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.540
Michael Hudson: You have you ever credentials. Yeah.

197
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.600
Richelle Direny: So, but then for for like her.

198
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:30.930
Richelle Direny: How would that be so like I used to work in a psych facility. And that was one big thing, like when you have to go to work, because usually during crisis like this. A lot of people like their anxiety gets increased and so you find an increase in admissions in a psychiatric facility.

199
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:42.960
Richelle Direny: So for someone, you know, with her with her anxiety kind of in, like you said, changing her routine. What is your preparation to assist through that.

200
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:55.860
Michael Hudson: Okay, to explain to you. You wouldn't disagree. I don't want to sound I have gone through so much and so everything is I can't even explain to you. Everything that I've gone through since

201
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.510
Michael Hudson: This happened. I knew she was a pistol to start out with. And that's why we got

202
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.200
Michael Hudson: Together we try

203
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:15.690
Michael Hudson: This is just something that you don't see on TV and and i i don't even think i'm not i'm prepared for whatever comes along. I don't want to say like that. There's food, little bit of money put up

204
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.620
Michael Hudson: I just have to deal with it. And you know what I mean, that's kind of way I feel about. That's what I do now every day is I would end up just like

205
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.530
Michael Hudson: I can tell you what it's like a boom.

206
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.460
Richelle Direny: So it's like, it's always

207
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.970
Michael Hudson: Every five minutes late. So, and I have to just

208
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.540
Michael Hudson: lacks a common down. And so it

209
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:43.980
Michael Hudson: You just have to see the view work where you take, you know, what you just told me you you get it.

210
00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.230
Michael Hudson: Where it is now, I think.

211
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:56.160
Richelle Direny: I think it's all, it's kind of identifying new routines on because it almost sounds like she has moments of mania.

212
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.110
Richelle Direny: Is what which she's she was never diagnosed bipolar. Was she

213
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.330
Michael Hudson: I think she was officially seen any one of your capacity to

214
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:14.700
Richelle Direny: To make to have a diagnosis. Okay. Because based on what you're saying. It sounds like there's some degree of mania that's coupled with that but

215
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:25.260
Richelle Direny: And so it's identifying, you know, what are some of those triggers and you're saying like one of those triggers is when you have to take her out of her routine because people who have routine.

216
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:36.690
Richelle Direny: You have to be aware of what the routine is in any kind of slip up of that routine can throw the person into like almost an anxiety attack or

217
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:43.800
Richelle Direny: You know, do her become manic because you're taking them out of that routine and I can see something like this with everything that's going on.

218
00:26:44.220 --> 00:27:00.660
Richelle Direny: I can see what I can almost foresee for people who have these mental health disorders. What it's going to do for them. And so I think for that for your own emotional and mental state of mind.

219
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:12.210
Richelle Direny: It's kind of start thinking ahead of What processes do I put in place that in the event. Now I'm home with my wife and

220
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:26.160
Richelle Direny: She is forced to have to stay home in lockdown and can't go out, what is it going to do to her mentally and then the stress that it's going to bring on her. Is it going to increase her blood pressure.

221
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.000
Richelle Direny: For because the she has high blood pressure as well. Right.

222
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.260
Michael Hudson: Diabetic it's the same

223
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.370
Richelle Direny: Even with

224
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.150
Michael Hudson: You know with up and down with blood sugar's up and down and having to need to

225
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:48.270
Richelle Direny: Control that because, because this is the other thing I truly believe that stress is one of those factors that no one can test for with

226
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:57.060
Richelle Direny: And unless you really truly a studying this person each and every day to know when she really gets overly stress.

227
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:05.340
Richelle Direny: You know, it could spike her blood sugar outside of the natural causes of what can do that. It could either spike it make it lower her and guide psyche go up or down.

228
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.850
Richelle Direny: But it's just being prepared for that. The stress of saying hey you know what we have to stay home.

229
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:25.020
Richelle Direny: We are not allowed to go out and we have to do this for the next two weeks or three weeks. And so for you mentally outside of everything that you've ever experienced this situation is very new for her and for you.

230
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.670
Michael Hudson: This

231
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:44.670
Richelle Direny: Down. It's very new. So it's kind of like, oh, I've experienced ABC and D, but you've ever experienced this. And this magnitude. So given that you've never experienced it at this magnitude. Think about all of the SIS the circumstances and all of the the trials you have gone through with her.

232
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:56.760
Richelle Direny: What can what little thing that you can take from each thing and compile it together to help you to prepare for what could come in this time.

233
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:10.710
Richelle Direny: And it's just really preparing yourself. No one says that it will happen, or it's going to happen, but it's like it's better to be prepared that. And if it does, you already your sleep. Are you pretty much have

234
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.590
Michael Hudson: A thought about a little bit. And I think what

235
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:21.870
Michael Hudson: I think I would organize, I would spend time trying to figure out some kind of system that's what she can do is

236
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:34.350
Michael Hudson: Put stuff down forget where it is. I think I would work on an organizational system in the house where maybe that's frustrates you the most. Is she can't find anything I have it in hand, send it down. Five minutes later, she's looking forward

237
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:44.820
Michael Hudson: So I think that's what I would do. And also, I don't think, I mean where I think that I am right now just where I landed here. I don't think I'm going to end up not being able to, I think I'll be able to work.

238
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.100
Michael Hudson: I'll take I got so maybe I thought about putting in the truck and just letting it ride with me.

239
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:57.060
Michael Hudson: To get her out, you know, so that's the two things I thought about should we get put in that situation.

240
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:59.580
Richelle Direny: Have you ever done that before.

241
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:00.480
With her

242
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.090
Michael Hudson: Couple times

243
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.880
Richelle Direny: And how does she like it having to rattle around with

244
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:17.850
Michael Hudson: It say she likes it, we don't you know just the anxiety in the vehicle, you know, just when it's probably not a good idea. And I bring out

245
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.480
Michael Hudson: What's the

246
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.180
Michael Hudson: Word.

247
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:40.380
Richelle Direny: Because I'm like, if it's if it's something if she's liked it. In the past, or you may hurt like a really useful in the sense that

248
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:51.690
Richelle Direny: You know she's a part of the whole equation. She's a part of the process in the work of she likes it, then maybe you know it would be a good idea if if her routine is going to now change.

249
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.720
Richelle Direny: Is definitely something to think about. But if that's not gonna work.

250
00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:58.920
Michael Hudson: It won't put you

251
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.920
Richelle Direny: Out of a job then know

252
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.730
Richelle Direny: What puts you out of a job is sure what in

253
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.050
Richelle Direny: Corona was my wife.

254
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:10.980
Michael Hudson: To drink.

255
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.520
Michael Hudson: No.

256
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:23.880
Michael Hudson: No, no, I appreciate that embalming I'll think about that. I just never thought about. I mean, I have worked for the last

257
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:37.170
Michael Hudson: Five or six years straight day 364 days a year, no holidays and it just because of her loss of income, not being able to come in and I got same amount of bills and we both have the same number. So,

258
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:45.150
Michael Hudson: I when I buried myself into work and so it almost, it would be a welcome change. I think for just a little while.

259
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.130
A little while

260
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:55.860
Michael Hudson: I know that you're in the middle of lunch you by met with me at lunch today. Are you are you I didn't want to

261
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:01.980
Richelle Direny: eat lunch, whatever time. I usually eat lunch with someone she don't roll up to like one clocks.

262
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.240
Michael Hudson: Just want to keep you from anything. I really appreciate you mentioning it

263
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.340
Michael Hudson: Know,

264
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:16.560
Michael Hudson: This whole thing is just thrown off my whole plan of conversation. I just, you know, just the way things have gone down last couple days so

265
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:27.930
Michael Hudson: I don't have anything dramatic on my brain. And I just want to let you know where I I've never done heroin and I haven't. I started doing

266
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.560
Michael Hudson: Had pain medication and it got out of control. I was doing a couple two three extra day I found myself doing

267
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:45.960
Michael Hudson: And I have neuropathy diabetic neuropathy. So what I did. I was talking to my doctor and I didn't want to go to the doctor's office every month again and

268
00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:56.490
Michael Hudson: I talked to my doctor and I had to have some control because it's just a, it's a nerve damage thing with me. And so the Suboxone

269
00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:12.150
Michael Hudson: I dropped that I call Dr. Malik myself and I said you know when to try it out. That's a boxing to stop that and they're off the park. So I haven't had any are opting for the last 1415 months as long as I've been doing this. And that's where I came from. So

270
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.520
Michael Hudson: When I sit there and I try to not be disrespectful and I, I've got an empathetic both everybody in this situation.

271
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:30.210
Michael Hudson: Some of them I doubt there's been a couple of them are really very hated me just about the pregnancy thing I discussed earlier. Like, I mean, I couldn't even breathe.

272
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.280
Michael Hudson: Last, you know, it's just

273
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.790
Michael Hudson: It's just a personal thing. I mean, it's not judging anybody. It's just like, you know,

274
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.620
Michael Hudson: But

275
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.340
Michael Hudson: The longer I've been around this. I've learned to kind of understand more.

276
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:56.550
Michael Hudson: It's like that day when I stuck my foot my mouth, I say somebody told you go left or go right and this is going to destroy your life or go right

277
00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:57.690
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

278
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.010
Michael Hudson: Well, I kind of stuck my foot. My mouth that day and I didn't mean to, but I never

279
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:11.760
Michael Hudson: I just did. I have trouble sitting there that's reason I come once a month, I just have trouble with that conversation, nobody

280
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.760
Michael Hudson: I just, I don't feel

281
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.010
Michael Hudson: Involved in that conversation.

282
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.390
Richelle Direny: You don't feel like and I feel so this is so this is how I think.

283
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:29.460
Richelle Direny: I think everything is just based on a perspective of how people look I think because I think you can learn from everyone no matter what, whether

284
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:41.430
Richelle Direny: Or they're not. What are your thing is just, you know, you know, I get depressed because of life or whatever you can learn from everyone, because you can say something and I can take whatever you're saying to me.

285
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:52.560
Richelle Direny: And I can find a way to apply it to. How can what he is saying the underlining thought of what he's saying, or the main point. How can I apply to even my situation and circumstance, because

286
00:34:53.610 --> 00:35:00.090
Richelle Direny: We're all humans we're all likely to experience something in life and I can learn from you.

287
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:13.830
Richelle Direny: I can learn from a person who is a heroin addict, because it's to me in my eyes. It really truly isn't so much about the drug itself whether your drug of choices pain pills or someone else's alcohol or

288
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:34.500
Richelle Direny: Whatever it is, whatever your drug of choice is all it is, you're addicted to the idea of masking the core of what is bothering you, what is causing you to take something or to reach for something, some kind of numbing device, some kind of feel good device for that moment.

289
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:44.550
Richelle Direny: So it's really just all about, you know, a person's perspective and depending again on what season you are in life, what your face, you

290
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:52.680
Richelle Direny: Are much older individual you've been there for 20 years you have your own cross that you have to bear and you have to deal with on a day to day basis.

291
00:35:53.160 --> 00:36:00.330
Richelle Direny: I'm a younger person my cross that I have to bear. It's based on my years of life which is far less than yours.

292
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:16.680
Richelle Direny: So it really depends on. So one person speaks, it's going to speaking very differently than how it speaks to you based on the season that you are in your life and what you've experienced and what you've dealt with and everything that's just kind of the perspective that I see it honestly

293
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:30.270
Richelle Direny: The way I look at things. I don't think that anyone like I'm not necessarily your traditional or your routine type of counselor, I go with, like, what is going on with you right now that is what's going on. That's how I look at it.

294
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:38.340
Richelle Direny: If what's going on. Like, I look at right now with the crisis of everything that's going on right now.

295
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:50.970
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm going to address because that's primary to what your original reason you are in the program because that's a stressor that's going on right now. And if we don't

296
00:36:51.390 --> 00:37:01.860
Richelle Direny: Learn how to hold in control and deal with it. Yes. What's going to happen. You're going to go back to your old habits of finding that feel good numbing device.

297
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:17.430
Richelle Direny: To keep you calm and that's just kind of house. So don't ever for by any means, if you're going to be meet with me from here on out. Don't feel like you need to come presented with some traumatic event if nothing happened to you, dramatic the day we ain't talking about

298
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.460
Michael Hudson: I was going to show you know I was going to go into

299
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.020
Michael Hudson: Yeah, and I

300
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:33.630
Michael Hudson: I just, I get it. And I understand. And that's why I wanted to talk to you and just posted the other person because of your thought process and the way you express yourself and how you come up with a. That's why we go

301
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:45.120
Richelle Direny: But yeah, if nothing is dramatic going on. Don't make up nothing dramatic because I'm a call you out on it, like, Okay, listen. Let's go with what what is real for you right now.

302
00:37:45.450 --> 00:38:02.040
Richelle Direny: What is something real that you're facing right now and if, what if, now if something in your past is present right now and causing any stressor, then let's talk about it. But if something pressing in, and I know from group until now.

303
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:11.670
Richelle Direny: What's pressing right now is what you're going through with your wife. That's a lot to deal with that is a lot because you're talking about

304
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:24.450
Richelle Direny: You know it's it's reflecting back on the vows, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us you're living that you're living your vows right this very moment.

305
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:38.580
Richelle Direny: You are living your vows and like you said you've been with a person for so long, are going to say, hey, you're a sign up for this. So let me bounce know you did sign up for it. You just never knew you were going to experience it like this.

306
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.630
Richelle Direny: Now that I'm living my vows.

307
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:53.250
Richelle Direny: How do I really truly live my vows, because this is hard because what I'm dealing with with my wife right now.

308
00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:03.150
Richelle Direny: Is very different from this loving bubbly person that we can sit and have a conversation. We can go out to dinner, you know, I'm not doing all of this for her so now

309
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:13.080
Richelle Direny: I'm having to live in. How do I do, how do I go through it. Is there someone that I can talk to about how I'm feeling right now and how I'm overwhelmed right now.

310
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:25.800
Richelle Direny: And what I really truly appreciated about when you brought this up. And I think that speaks volumes to what's going on. It's when you talked about your situation.

311
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:32.640
Richelle Direny: And you express emotions in it. It's like, that's real because that's really truly what's going on with you right now.

312
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:40.020
Richelle Direny: And it's not bottling up because that's where the stressors coming. That's where the depression come in because then society teaches us

313
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.340
Richelle Direny: Not to show our emotions, not to express our emotions and not to speak about it.

314
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:56.280
Richelle Direny: Well you know what, that's really what causes our depression because we're locking it up all inside, you have to release it. That's how you learn to deal with it. And that's how you learn to cope with it in a healthy manner.

315
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:09.510
Richelle Direny: It's by talking about it if your reality right now is, you know what, you know, I live at home. It's just my wife and I, she has her issues and I'm learning to

316
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.640
Richelle Direny: I'm having to deal with it. And I never thought that

317
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:23.400
Richelle Direny: This is how it's going to be, because in our mind when I said I do to my husband. I said, I do to a wonderful life.

318
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:33.240
Richelle Direny: I dream that when I get into my 16th. We can travel the world because that's what we talked about. We can retire. We can travel, we can visit the grandkids, we could do this, we can do that.

319
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:42.420
Richelle Direny: That's what we talked about doing never did. I talked about nama have to give her a bath. Now I'm gonna have to make sure I watch her and I'm gonna have to put a life alert on her.

320
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:58.110
Richelle Direny: Never did I think about that. But now, that's my reality and nobody else around me is really going through it. So how do I cope with the part of my vows that says, in sickness and in health,

321
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.240
Richelle Direny: Till death do us

322
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:09.390
Michael Hudson: Part of stress on your side and I can only imagine that to you know it's a key conversation quite a bit and in your thought process, I guess. Yeah, I guess.

323
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:22.440
Richelle Direny: So, but, but, but I'm saying all of this to say like, you think about it, and you process that 20 years ago or whenever it was 20 years ago. You say you got married 20 years ago right

324
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:38.730
Richelle Direny: 22 years ago when you looked at this woman that you were smitten by and you say, I want to spend the rest of my life with her and you said those vows. Did you really truly process every word of those vowels. When you said it.

325
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:56.580
Michael Hudson: Not really processing. Oh no, it was just emotional. I mean, you knew you knew what you wanted to do something that was a process to go through. But I was already there. You know you. It was a piece of paper, but it was we were already bonded. You know, so

326
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:57.540
Michael Hudson: Sure, but but

327
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:04.860
Richelle Direny: But now those vowels are right in your face. They're standing up in your face and now you're like, Whoa.

328
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.360
Richelle Direny: To how do I get through this.

329
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.210
Richelle Direny: And I'm doing this just for myself.

330
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.180
Richelle Direny: People could come help you but

331
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.810
Michael Hudson: They could

332
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:27.780
Michael Hudson: Be killed me already. Just going to God. I don't even know what to say about it, but you just go with the flow. That's all I can you know and then people some, you know, the thing, it really

333
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:36.750
Michael Hudson: I don't talk about them is because when people hear about it. They're like, oh, you know, I've got so much freestyle. Yeah, I don't want. That's not why I'm not here to that purpose. It's not

334
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:47.610
Michael Hudson: I'm here because I do what I do miss my life. I don't go to work, talk about my life case. I got a call and say, look, I'm going to be off tonight because I got some to deal with whether that'd be up or down here, but

335
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:56.970
Michael Hudson: It's really not something to discuss, you know, and that's why Dr. Davis and didn't know anything about I've never brought it up, never talked to you about one time and it's not

336
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:09.390
Michael Hudson: Hard, you know, you look at it and it just goes by so quick. I mean it happens even just what you do and it just goes like that and go to sleep and get up the next day and you start all over again. And it's not something you look at, like,

337
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:17.310
Michael Hudson: Not a challenge is just what it is. It's what it is, you know, just the way things are. And you deal with what you have to deal with and

338
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:24.780
Michael Hudson: That's the only way you can do it if you lay down or you give up. You can't give up. I mean, you saw the choice. You just stopped breathing cycle happen.

339
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:35.580
Michael Hudson: And keep on reading. I wish you were dead, but you're not gonna die. There is time to get off the earth, unless you know do something stupid. So what choice do you have, you know, if you

340
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.800
Michael Hudson: Call it stuck. It's just the way things are. That makes sense.

341
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.100
Richelle Direny: To do things. Are you just have to

342
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:45.930
Michael Hudson: It's the

343
00:43:47.280 --> 00:44:01.830
Michael Hudson: Same thing you do. I mean, it's what you do every day it's love it's love it's care, it's just in you and that's just what you do. Some people don't have an element that's just their that's their deal done no judgment and just saying they would do whatever. But, you know, you

344
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:11.730
Michael Hudson: Do what you do. Because of that, and you understand when I say what I'm saying. And it's just they're just happens every day. That's just went from there is a bad Sunday's hell yeah it's bad. So

345
00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:18.180
Michael Hudson: Good Sunday is funny. Some days has been good to laugh at me, but

346
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.110
Michael Hudson: You know nothing funny funny about it, but I'm just saying that

347
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.950
Michael Hudson: You've been, I've been through every way that you can go through this feel sorry for yourself. I'm depressed. I don't want to

348
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:38.310
Michael Hudson: You know it's nothing's ever going to be good for me. I'm always going to be like the you know you everything you've ever thank God I'm probably sat and thought about our thoughts.

349
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:53.820
Michael Hudson: And then they're going to kick in, say, look, you know, two choices. I can either sit here and mope and feel sorry for myself and watch everything gets screwed up or you can go on and do what you're supposed to do. And there's always something good, that comes out that day, you know, I mean,

350
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.470
Michael Hudson: It's not something good.

351
00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:13.320
Richelle Direny: Something that happens and you can look back at the end of that day and says, What did I learn from this and I went through it. And so now there's something good on the, on the other end of it. So are you willing to go through

352
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:25.830
Richelle Direny: Whatever you have to go through. It's kind of like, you know, you sometimes I pray, I want to be a little bit more humble you pray for humility you pray for humility. Humility is not just going to zap and you're going to get it.

353
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.160
Richelle Direny: You have to go through something

354
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:36.900
Richelle Direny: So that you can learn humility, at the end of it. So now you've gotten what you prayed for you just never expected

355
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:50.250
Richelle Direny: To get it the way you got it, but you'll get the humility. You just have to go through something to understand what being humble is you have to have experienced something in life.

356
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:59.010
Richelle Direny: To really know when I'm teaching you about humility. I'm not teaching you just because I read it in a book I'm teaching it to you because I went through life.

357
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:08.580
Richelle Direny: To understand what humility is and that's just kind of how you know like even with everything that you're going through even with your wife.

358
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:21.960
Richelle Direny: You know, maybe you can teach someone else maybe later on that might be at the beginning of the road where they have challenges within their own relationship and they don't think they can get through it. Maybe you can say, hey, listen.

359
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:35.070
Richelle Direny: You know, you, you, it will you can get it. You can go through it, because oftentimes, like you said you don't talk about your life at work, but then maybe there is somebody that one day you can share with them.

360
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:44.130
Richelle Direny: And then they'll be like, Oh my god, I didn't know what's going on. Yeah, just because you see me. That doesn't mean I don't have a war that I have to deal with.

361
00:46:44.640 --> 00:47:02.220
Richelle Direny: Behind closed doors, doesn't mean that I'm not fighting a war behind closed doors and so I'm just letting you know so you can be an encouragement for someone. But again, you first have to be completely aware what is it that I'm going through. How can I get through this day and what

362
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:21.540
Richelle Direny: coping skills. Can I use to help me to get through this day mentally and emotionally because those are the two things that are very important emotions often give us different thoughts and like you said, it can lead you. This direction or that direction, it can lead you in two different

363
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:34.440
Richelle Direny: Pattern. You have to be fully aware of the emotions because emotions they come in, go all the time. I'm mad right now I get over it. I'm happy I stopped. Nobody can be mad, the whole day and nobody can be happy to hold their

364
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:39.570
Richelle Direny: Emotions. They come and they go, they cycle the emotion cycle and

365
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:49.290
Michael Hudson: Because your brain is always I've been listening to books audiobooks. And these guys said emotions are tied to your thoughts and your thought

366
00:47:49.560 --> 00:48:01.590
Michael Hudson: If you think that you're mad or angry, then you're then you're mad, but that's because your brain is telling your body the brain drives everything right, you have to take that breath and

367
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:10.320
Michael Hudson: Practicing is like six months you take that breath and try to calm that down. I'm not a violent person never been

368
00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:18.510
Michael Hudson: Angry yeah I've been a really but not by me or anything like that. And so

369
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:25.020
Michael Hudson: Your brain is constantly constant going every time when you stop. It's still going. So I breathe. And the guy said, you know, you breathe.

370
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:33.990
Michael Hudson: And you think about it, okay, breathes. Then I caught myself breathing six times. Well, all day long. You believe and you don't think about it any other time anything

371
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:41.520
Michael Hudson: That's what your brain does is kicking out the emotions. Every time you go right here it's thinking about you're getting mad, and then you're happy.

372
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.430
Richelle Direny: And then all of that a couple together sugars or behavior or response.

373
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:56.010
Richelle Direny: And so emotionally a mad, your brain. Your brain is saying, Okay, I'm mad about something, emotionally, you start acting a certain way and then it kicks out a response and then

374
00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:05.970
Richelle Direny: Once you kick out the response you realize this is what I was thinking I was feeling and now look what I did. And now all of the emotion and thoughts go away based on how

375
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:07.890
Richelle Direny: You took it.

376
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.450
Michael Hudson: What directory. Actually, I think.

377
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.120
Michael Hudson: That's where I take it.

378
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:22.830
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. It's like, I don't know. I don't know. You know what you believe. But it's kind of like there's this biblical saying be angry but sin not.

379
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.850
Richelle Direny: And it simply means that it's okay to be angry.

380
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:43.440
Richelle Direny: Be mindful of your reaction because your reaction can go into different directions. It could be bad, or it can be good. So it says be angry, but be mindful of how you react to that emotion.

381
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:52.500
Richelle Direny: And that's all the same. It's okay. You can be mad somebody cut you off on the road, you can be mad, are you now going to jump out your car.

382
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.250
Richelle Direny: And go take like I this actually unfolded in front of me one day and I was like my heart was beating as I was seeing this

383
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:09.720
Richelle Direny: I don't know what somebody that I know they cut the person off. I don't know what they did this guy jumps out of his car and he's Raven and I swear to you, Michael.

384
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:24.990
Richelle Direny: In just that flash of the moment I thought this was going to get a gun, just how he was behaving. And I'm like, oh God, please like and then eventually like turn and everybody start moving, so he jumped in his car and he was just acting erratic, but I'm just like,

385
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:38.220
Richelle Direny: If he really had reacted how my mind was playing out the whole scenario. Now you were angry and it was okay for you to be angry. But then your reaction could have landed you behind bars for a lifetime.

386
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:38.790
Mm hmm.

387
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:45.330
Michael Hudson: Absolutely. My sister has road rage. Right. And she was an executive and Lamar and she's

388
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:54.450
Michael Hudson: She's going down the road in Columbus and going completely off and you know she i'm not talking a little bit of road rage. I don't ride with her at all.

389
00:50:55.290 --> 00:51:11.550
Michael Hudson: And she gets home parks or car. Well, guess who walks around the corner. It's the guy that lives above or in this little apartment complex that she just moved into he loved the note on a car. So she saw him doing it just want to let you know that I live here. And if you, you know,

390
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:16.890
Michael Hudson: I guess he was. I don't know what the notes here, but that was her. She thought she never see the guy again.

391
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.060
Wow.

392
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:27.570
Michael Hudson: Yeah, right. So she had to move because that she moved out of there, about a month after that and I had to go move her again.

393
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.180
Richelle Direny: Simply because it

394
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:30.570
Michael Hudson: Says,

395
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:41.670
Richelle Direny: Be angry but sin, not because you never know what because when you sometimes when you you have to be in control of it, it's only an emotion that's going to pass on by

396
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.180
Richelle Direny: And depending on the especially the intensity of the emotion. Sometimes it could take you down the wrong path.

397
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:58.920
Richelle Direny: And that half can ultimately lead to your very destruction or it can be. It's just really truly just how you respond to it. So I think ultimately

398
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:07.590
Richelle Direny: You know, all in all, it's just you have to take any emotional and mental inventory of yourself daily just to ensure

399
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:20.730
Richelle Direny: If I want to be successful at the end of the day, I have to be aware of these passing emotions and not let it lead me down a road of destruction or Ultimate Despair because on

400
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.980
Richelle Direny: Regret

401
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:25.500
Richelle Direny: Is something that

402
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.510
Richelle Direny: Your conscience, please on you all the time.

403
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:42.960
Richelle Direny: And that alone can really make you spiral down is just living in regret. So just, you know, just take a emotional and mental

404
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:54.240
Richelle Direny: Inventory daily just off yourself first, and be kind of where you need to be at homeostasis, or try to be at homeostasis daily, especially in these

405
00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:04.530
Richelle Direny: troubling times that we're faced with because you know what, when you still remain at homeostasis, at least try. You can definitely be there for your wife 100%

406
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:12.810
Richelle Direny: And you can be there for anybody else that you need to be there at 100% but if your mind is so unstable. You ain't no used to her.

407
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.820
Michael Hudson: No good anyone else. Exactly right.

408
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.930
Richelle Direny: So,

409
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:19.920
Richelle Direny: You know, just

410
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:29.790
Richelle Direny: Just, just stay where you need to be just a daily and you know it. Don't watch too much that news because you know that sometimes people just that's just like turn it off just turn it off because

411
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:38.790
Michael Hudson: That was just my hobby. I actually laughed about it, you know, watch you know people whine, just like little babies, because you guys President and I watched the other side.

412
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:46.530
Michael Hudson: You know, a president can't speak a whole sentence without making some kind of Bourbon steak, but he's president and it's just so funny. The whole thing just

413
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:58.500
Michael Hudson: Loud I don't go around telling vote on the honestly I just don't vote because I know the waste of my time, it is to go down there and vote. So I figured that out a long time ago. So

414
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.440
Michael Hudson: Thank you for talking to me today. I appreciate you mean when you made me. You made my day. Happy. Happy.

417
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:17.910
Michael Hudson: Tuesday at eight.

418
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:24.360
Michael Hudson: Okay, that's my normal time she's asked me to come twice a month, so I will be

419
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.450
Michael Hudson: A lot easier.

420
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.790
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right, then. And if you
