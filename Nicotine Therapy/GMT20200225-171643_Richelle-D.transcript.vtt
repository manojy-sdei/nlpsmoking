00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.280
Crystal Gatwood: Um, well, the past few years have been kind of crazy for me because my dad was in the hospital.

6
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.260
Crystal Gatwood: So,

7
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.590
Crystal Gatwood: He's home now. We just got him home and stuff so

8
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.770
Crystal Gatwood: Well, he has COPD. He got got diagnosed, about five months ago.

9
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:28.500
Crystal Gatwood: And he's a type of person I, you know, decide on you know pills or I don't take a pill. So he doesn't even take like his own blood pressure pill or anything.

10
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.750
Crystal Gatwood: He just keep

11
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.270
Crystal Gatwood: Writing

12
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.100
But

13
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.370
Crystal Gatwood: We found out that he has sleep Batman.

14
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.360
Crystal Gatwood: He was in there for testing.

15
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.240
Richelle Direny: Everything is fun.

16
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.230
Yes.

17
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.780
Richelle Direny: your stress level down

18
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.660
Richelle Direny: So that was pretty much the most thing that went on.

19
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.600
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

20
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.130
Richelle Direny: At least since we last year.

21
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.750
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

22
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.660
Crystal Gatwood: Everything else has been pretty quiet with me just working on fixing my car so

23
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.350
Richelle Direny: You're waiting on your tax return or your time.

24
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.660
Crystal Gatwood: And

25
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.800
Crystal Gatwood: My tax return. I'm waiting to I'm fixing my car when I said

26
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.890
Richelle Direny: No, I know, I know, but I know you said that they weren't you weren't know your tax returns will be able to fix the car.

27
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.810
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I don't even file until the third

28
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.970
Crystal Gatwood: I have an appointment.

29
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.490
Richelle Direny: Well, the third of Muslim is next week.

30
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.060
Richelle Direny: Okay, and then after you finish it takes like two weeks before everything

31
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.210
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, we usually get mine like within a week or so much usually pretty fast. I don't know why.

32
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.760
Crystal Gatwood: Let's get ready to wash my hair. And I'm like, oh, I have counseling today.

33
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.070
Crystal Gatwood: So, don't mind me, I'm not ready yet.

34
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.250
Richelle Direny: Here.

35
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.510
Richelle Direny: And then you remember you have a group on what

36
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.670
Crystal Gatwood: I remember group. But for some reason, I just forgot about today.

37
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.880
Richelle Direny: You will in group last person. Yeah.

38
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.760
Crystal Gatwood: Well number I checked in with you, but I had a doctor's appointment.

39
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.500
Richelle Direny: Yes, that's right. That's right. That's right. And you don't need anything right.

40
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.310
Crystal Gatwood: I had my I got my ritual yesterday yesterday or the day before.

41
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.080
Crystal Gatwood: Monday.

42
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.290
Crystal Gatwood: Yesterday, I'm all screwed up right now.

43
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.900
Richelle Direny: How is it everything like I know one of the things we talked about last time was there inside

44
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:22.800
Richelle Direny: You know, go to the store, you're going and kind of powers. What have you had any kind of moments, go to the hospitals in your dad or just dealing with Apple

45
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:35.880
Crystal Gatwood: II was like in like an observation room area. So he was kind of, I wouldn't say isolated, but he was kind of like in a

46
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.050
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know. There wasn't a lot of people there.

47
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.620
Richelle Direny: So it wasn't, it wasn't an anxiety provoking for you.

48
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.380
Crystal Gatwood: Now, more or less worried about my dad.

49
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.020
Richelle Direny: Come home.

50
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.420
Richelle Direny: And

51
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:05.460
Richelle Direny: But outside of that study like how's everything going for you in terms of, like, have you had any instances in the last time we met of

52
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.410
Richelle Direny: Why

53
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.350
Crystal Gatwood: I have my hearing for my to tomorrow.

54
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:34.320
Crystal Gatwood: And I think that's just for it to like be in effect. Yeah. I mean, I've never done it before, but as my understanding, like I already have the order, but my hearing, they say is the 26 so I have that tomorrow morning, and I think that's just for it to like legally take effect.

55
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.080
Richelle Direny: Was to

56
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.630
Crystal Gatwood: temporary protection order.

57
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.500
Richelle Direny: Like, oh that's right from your, your son status.

58
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.390
Richelle Direny: OK. And how's that been since to

59
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.610
Richelle Direny: You guys and separated

60
00:06:51.510 --> 00:07:01.950
Crystal Gatwood: Um, I've been okay um it's more or less just affecting my son. He certain ask questions, you know, where's that is and stuff.

61
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:18.780
Crystal Gatwood: I really don't know what to say. But I sat him down and you know I told him you know mind it just, we don't really get along anymore and we don't want to fight in front of you. So we think it's better that we live apart.

62
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.420
Crystal Gatwood: And I mean, he was just okay you know how kids are but

63
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:34.050
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know, but I mean in school like he gets. I'm like, he's in kindergarten. So he has a behavior chart.

64
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:54.810
Crystal Gatwood: And you know, I like easily his behavior char is not good. It's a usually he comes home with a know every day and everything like that. And, you know, ever since. But Justin's not been in our house. He has gotten smiley faces and stars every day.

65
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.710
Crystal Gatwood: So yeah, and I'm like, you know, maybe that was it. I don't know.

66
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.110
Crystal Gatwood: But I do know that it does take effect on kids because I went through that shit to

67
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.100
Richelle Direny: Try

68
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.100
Richelle Direny: To change how

69
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.290
Crystal Gatwood: Far yeah you

70
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.740
Richelle Direny: Know, so it's pretty much. It's pretty aware

71
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.950
Richelle Direny: Did you ask him, like what's the difference with the changing notify he's getting smiley faces.

72
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:38.280
Crystal Gatwood: I really haven't brought it up that sense in like, you know, asked him what the changes but i just i rewarded him.

73
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.570
Richelle Direny: For the change

74
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.040
Crystal Gatwood: Like we went to like a trampoline park and had some fun. You know, I took a little friend with us and stuff but

75
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:58.440
Crystal Gatwood: And it was fun, and he enjoyed himself and he realized, you know, hey, you know, like, even in school. If I behave, you know, but I just, I really haven't asked him in that kind of sense.

76
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.210
Richelle Direny: Of course of course you're going to bring it to a level, in which he can understand

77
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:14.460
Richelle Direny: Right. But did you that's great that you did reward the behavior. But did you tell him that you are rewarding him because he has been consistently getting smiley faces and good reports.

78
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:25.110
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. In, in, of course, you know, and I think that once you kind of put it, you know, you let them know okay you're being rewarded because of all these wonderful things.

79
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:40.650
Richelle Direny: Going on in school and that you know if he keeps if he continues one. This is the you know the the reward of having good behaviors for listening to your teacher. So what we need to do that will

80
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:53.130
Richelle Direny: Be a motivator and encouragement for them. And I think overall, you will, it will impact you as well because then he looks forward to doing it, you look forward to rewarding him.

81
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.480
Richelle Direny: And then what you said, making that connection as to whether or not

82
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.610
Richelle Direny: The determine that had been occurring between you and his father.

83
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:13.620
Richelle Direny: You will notice how much his behavior has turned around and maybe a lot of the acting out or he was displaying at school, what he was seeing.

84
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.950
Crystal Gatwood: Schools, you know when he's just with me.

85
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:31.350
Crystal Gatwood: Like, usually it's a fight every morning just to getting dressed dressed brushes teeth, which I know like he has ADHD like symptoms. I haven't clinically got him diagnosed actually

86
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.170
Crystal Gatwood: But

87
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.740
Crystal Gatwood: Um, he just

88
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.390
Crystal Gatwood: His behavior has changed with me like this morning, he got himself dressed and

89
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:55.740
Crystal Gatwood: There was no fighting, you know, and I was just like, you know what, thank you, buddy. You look nice today. You know, and he was like happy with it. And I don't know if it's because Justin is out of the homes.

90
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.460
Crystal Gatwood: I'm not sure I don't have to ask him. Does that make sense.

91
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.450
Mm hmm.

92
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.180
Richelle Direny: Um,

93
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:20.490
Richelle Direny: He's he is young. There's so much that you can get him to, you know, in his own way to be able to understand and to know how to answer the question and

94
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:33.840
Richelle Direny: You know, of course we to have the lower expectation of what the answer is going to look like because often times they kind of feed off of the way you're asking the question, and they'll tend to give you the answer that you are seeking out

95
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.650
Richelle Direny: Right. And, you know, five some five year olds are a little bit more and

96
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.080
Richelle Direny: A little bit more.

97
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.000
Richelle Direny: Aware.

98
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:55.320
Richelle Direny: A little bit more articulate than others. So you have to know for him. And if you can see the changes and you can kind of correlate it to because they're

99
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:04.350
Richelle Direny: Somewhat of a positive change in terms of the constant bickering and fighting. He was suing continuously

100
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.250
Richelle Direny: Many that is having a bigger impact overall impact on him.

101
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.130
Richelle Direny: But, you know,

102
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.110
I mean,

103
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.220
Crystal Gatwood: That that we've had in the house. So, you know, I mean, so

104
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.870
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I can't directly put it to that. But I would probably say 80% of it is that

105
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.050
Richelle Direny: It will continue it will, if it's not related sooner.

106
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:43.380
Richelle Direny: Eventually we'll see kind of take a term, but for right now. I think it's just bonding with you. This is a reality that no matter how you know

107
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:51.210
Richelle Direny: To his contribution to him in reference to him being

108
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.920
Richelle Direny: An involved or not involved that the reality is you can only do so much as a mom and your role.

109
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:18.360
Richelle Direny: Your role is not to be a mom and a dad, you can't be a bad. You can only be a mom, but you can definitely teach him you know the different morals and values. The best way to know how to I think in this time it's just good for you to just just bond with him, you know,

110
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:32.340
Richelle Direny: Redirect different behaviors that are unacceptable reward those behaviors that are good and if there are consequences that needs to be implemented implement them accordingly. But you don't necessarily want to

111
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.240
Richelle Direny: overcompensate because that is not in the picture.

112
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:38.820
Crystal Gatwood: Right.

113
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.530
Richelle Direny: Because you also said to have

114
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.940
Richelle Direny: You also said that you have an older daughter, right.

115
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.120
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, she lives with her dad.

116
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.620
Richelle Direny: He's the only one that lives with you. Yes.

117
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.770
Richelle Direny: Okay, yeah. So you definitely want to overcompensate because that is not on the picture.

118
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:08.250
Richelle Direny: So let's just be mindful of that. But, um, but even so, do you find that it is

119
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:15.930
Richelle Direny: anxiety provoking that now it's kind of just you and your son alone and you're having to kind of figure out

120
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.730
Richelle Direny: How to me, can

121
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.070
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, yeah, it's

122
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:45.180
Crystal Gatwood: I feel like I'm just a lot less stressed with him as a home, you know, because I don't have to support him to and I don't have to worry about the arguing and stuff in front of my son. And that was a big, big thing with me, you know, because if I had something to say. I would say it and

123
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.070
Crystal Gatwood: I'm gonna say an adult way because me. He's very childish.

124
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.050
Richelle Direny: But I would like text it

125
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.610
Crystal Gatwood: To him or something you know I wouldn't say that stuff out. Wow. No.

126
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:57.900
But

127
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:07.800
Crystal Gatwood: I mean making ends. Me, I'm doing. I mean, I'm doing what I gotta do my dad and like I said he's been more helpful since Justin's out of the picture.

128
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.200
Crystal Gatwood: So, I mean, we're doing okay we have what we need.

129
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.360
Richelle Direny: He lives close by.

130
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.290
Yes.

131
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:35.760
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'm just, I mean, listen, if everything is. It's called moving in the right direction as far as where your son is concerned, and then just continue on that path.

132
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.050
Crystal Gatwood: As well whether or not like he hasn't asked about him.

133
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.700
Crystal Gatwood: In a few days and I'm where

134
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.670
I have the option.

135
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.750
Richelle Direny: You said you have the option to do

136
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.370
Crystal Gatwood: I have the option to do like a

137
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.460
Crystal Gatwood: Video vacation with him over the phone.

138
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.950
Crystal Gatwood: That would help.

139
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.880
Crystal Gatwood: My son or

140
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.820
Richelle Direny: Whether it was

141
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.580
Crystal Gatwood: A question questions or

142
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.720
Crystal Gatwood: At least get to see him a little bit but

143
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.690
Crystal Gatwood: I don't know what to do. There

144
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.300
Crystal Gatwood: I haven't said he hasn't asked in a few days. So I haven't really pushed it

145
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.720
Crystal Gatwood: But I figured since I have you on the phone. You know, I would ask what your opinion with me.

146
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.810
Richelle Direny: So, don't, don't. I wouldn't

147
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:48.120
Richelle Direny: You don't necessarily want to clear something. And if he asked if he says straight like no, I would like to talk to my dad. Now I'm assuming

148
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:57.360
Richelle Direny: You could always just whether you call him. You put them on FaceTime, whatever it is, and speak because you don't regardless of having the temporary

149
00:16:59.310 --> 00:16:59.790
Right and

150
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:06.120
Crystal Gatwood: I told the judge, you know. Only thing I want is for him not to be able to get out and come back to my home.

151
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:19.560
Crystal Gatwood: That's in the sun from him. I'm not getting it. I don't want it to be where I can't call him and talk about our song. I don't want that. You know, it's just fact that I didn't want him to be able to come back here and that's it.

152
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.530
Richelle Direny: And and so however you

153
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.370
Richelle Direny: You are back in the

154
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.530
Richelle Direny: court documents that you it's

155
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:07.350
Richelle Direny: Like back in the home because of a movie he still has a responsibility that had something

156
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.540
Richelle Direny: To put

157
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.380
Richelle Direny: In place that has been so the judge is not going to

158
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:22.260
Richelle Direny: Not that I'm aware of. That is not the stuff of course and from their child, it would just be that

159
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.930
Richelle Direny: You would have to find a world to

160
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:40.170
Richelle Direny: Just make like arrangement, whether it's supervised where you say, Okay, you know, you can move the parkland community here and you want to send them all.

161
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.360
Richelle Direny: If you see like, you know, for the thing or a situation, then

162
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:55.530
Richelle Direny: That's just kind of how we were doing it means that you have to say, okay, well, if you have a family member, because you will allow them to go and stay a day or two with it.

163
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:57.960
Crystal Gatwood: Um,

164
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.810
Richelle Direny: How would you allow him to

165
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:13.230
Crystal Gatwood: I, that's what I told him that, you know, if you wanted to see him or whatever. I wasn't willing from you I can meet you at seven. So please, you know, and we can exchange in there.

166
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.640
Richelle Direny: And that's all you have to to do this a lot.

167
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:32.430
Richelle Direny: About this is that call them, whether you do it on faith primarily do it. Use your card video chat record and you know that happens to him and you know if it means that, okay, well, he wants to see

168
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.290
Richelle Direny: If they can just bring home to or bring someone with you to say, Okay, I'm gonna keep going to get him that he's gonna go with that to beat this.

169
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:59.640
Richelle Direny: Team that we drop them off. If you just feel based on what you know about him that we're respond to certain way you feel at the time you're on Facebook or if it's just you alone, given that you have the training is a very restrained one right

170
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.080
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

171
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.430
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah up protection order restraining order. I don't know.

172
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.660
Like

173
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:15.690
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we'll just have to talk to them and just kind of make your own because at the end of the day, we still have to code.

174
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.220
Richelle Direny: Right. You're the things that are no longer in relationship.

175
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.590
Crystal Gatwood: If he makes the if he makes the attempt

176
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:35.490
Crystal Gatwood: I know last time we were apart and you didn't really, it didn't really seem that often, you know, and it killed me to see my son hurt.

177
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:51.090
Crystal Gatwood: So last time i thought i thought him a lot. Like, you know, you're going to see your son today. I don't care cancel your plans because you're seeing your son, you know and and I hated make him have to do that. I'm not doing it this time.

178
00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.740
Richelle Direny: So your, your focus on for you for the personnel.

179
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.760
Richelle Direny: parenting style being there for your son and providing. So that's kind of the number one priority.

180
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:20.400
Richelle Direny: over analyzing and in terms of whether or not he wants to be there. And I know that you would love to be involved.

181
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.750
Right.

182
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.240
Richelle Direny: But if that to my

183
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:38.490
Richelle Direny: Liking so I can't, you can't force them to be there too bad, and he can't force you to be there to be a mom. Is it your responsibility is it your, your obligation.

184
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.890
Richelle Direny: But then they're not going to force anybody to you.

185
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.130
Richelle Direny: Know what

186
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:49.080
Crystal Gatwood: It.

187
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.220
Crystal Gatwood: Just sucks.

188
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.660
Richelle Direny: Up here. That's one thing.

189
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.740
Crystal Gatwood: I do, just because of last time, the

190
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.030
Richelle Direny: Last one.

191
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.980
Crystal Gatwood: You know that I had to fight for Memphis to see him and

192
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:16.590
Crystal Gatwood: This time, and I and I told him, you know, I'm not going to do that again. But it just sucks because I hear

193
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.050
Crystal Gatwood: If he doesn't, step up,

194
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.700
Crystal Gatwood: I can't fill in for him. You know, I can't

195
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.220
Crystal Gatwood: Just

196
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.200
Richelle Direny: You're worried about the impact

197
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.880
Richelle Direny: And you're worried about how you're going to answer those questions, those difficult questions that

198
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.100
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

199
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.450
Richelle Direny: Do you foresee

200
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.060
Richelle Direny: Him not playing the role of the Father.

201
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.200
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

202
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.910
Crystal Gatwood: You just sucks because I know our hurts.

203
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.860
Crystal Gatwood: You know,

204
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.080
Richelle Direny: You have, you know, how it hurts you know how

205
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.030
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, like I went through that shit. When I was a kid.

206
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.240
Richelle Direny: Where, where your dad wasn't there when you

207
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.320
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, but it was actually my mom, you know, that was being a bit childish and

208
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.190
Crystal Gatwood: My dad was trying Zs but

209
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.400
Crystal Gatwood: She was just being resentful.

210
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:44.520
Richelle Direny: So you will because of the cool. What kind of the emotional roller coaster you one full month of to be there.

211
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.820
Richelle Direny: You

212
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.460
Richelle Direny: Don't want to go through it.

213
00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:51.480
Right.

214
00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:00.510
Richelle Direny: Do you see yourself possibly getting back into the relationship for the sake of being there.

215
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:02.970
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

216
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.530
Richelle Direny: Considering going back

217
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:18.390
Crystal Gatwood: No, I can't do it. I don't believe that he's going to change. I mean,

218
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.920
Crystal Gatwood: I'm gave him a chance after chance after chain.

219
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.830
Crystal Gatwood: Too many

220
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.300
Richelle Direny: Words.

221
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.560
Richelle Direny: For you, so

222
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.620
Richelle Direny: I mean, I

223
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:48.030
Crystal Gatwood: asked him if I wanted to know, you know, like him. If I was working or whatever, you know, he assumed that he was going to be watching Memphis while I work you know that I was a given

224
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.620
Crystal Gatwood: But

225
00:24:52.170 --> 00:25:02.730
Crystal Gatwood: If I wanted him to give him a bath. So I could do this, I would have to ask him to do that he wouldn't just do it, but he was there like emotionally. You know, like

226
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.860
Crystal Gatwood: He would pick him up from school, sometimes and

227
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:18.450
Crystal Gatwood: Play with things sometimes he was just there for him when we're together. But if we're not together. He's not there.

228
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.480
Crystal Gatwood: And that's another reason why I stayed so long.

229
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:32.100
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, the arguing got to the point where, you know, it wasn't healthy for you.

230
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.280
Crystal Gatwood: I just thought maybe it'd be better for our part.

231
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.520
Richelle Direny: So,

232
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:57.540
Richelle Direny: You're still going to the emotional this Court and upset from the unresolved thing that you had as a child or nothing. You can talk about that. The last time.

233
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:05.430
Richelle Direny: Your mind not being there in your mom still be involved now as an adult, you're still going through that.

234
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:27.900
Richelle Direny: So you're taking those same emotion and feeling exactly how you feel and put them on your son imagining that he is going to walk the same example that you're going to walk. Is he going to feel his father is absent. It sounded like he was somewhat accent even living in the house.

235
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.610
Richelle Direny: We were kind of already going through that right you are allowed to

236
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:40.860
Richelle Direny: you lower your standards. Yes, yes. So, and you put up a lot of stuff that

237
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.890
Richelle Direny: Could be there for that se

238
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.980
Richelle Direny: It now.

239
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.520
Richelle Direny: Do you feel that your father did the best he could for you, girl.

240
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.670
Richelle Direny: Yes, in the absence of them on.

241
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.590
Crystal Gatwood: The absence those because when I was just be insightful.

242
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:14.820
Richelle Direny: I know what I'm asking. Doing your father did the best he can raising you despite your mom just wanting to spy for whatever reason, there

243
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.750
Yeah.

244
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.040
Richelle Direny: Would you grow when you think about the relationship you have with your dad and how much

245
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.160
Richelle Direny: They buy you to live a lot

246
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.090
Richelle Direny: Do you appreciate him for what he did so.

247
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.790
Richelle Direny: You know,

248
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:47.520
Richelle Direny: What what i'm pleased about it out of this book. Now that your son will possibly be walking. Now the phone. What can we do working say that you've learned from there, that that you can do for yourself.

249
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.220
Crystal Gatwood: I mean,

250
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.450
Crystal Gatwood: I don't honestly I don't really know. I don't

251
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.490
Crystal Gatwood: I feel kind of how my dad feels, in a way, but I

252
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.630
Richelle Direny: Don't remember.

253
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.400
Richelle Direny: What it was

254
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.670
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry.

255
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.220
Richelle Direny: So what, how did that come to you.

256
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.110
Crystal Gatwood: Like he

257
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:31.320
Crystal Gatwood: Was like, yeah, it took me a long time to realize this. You know what I mean, like, as I got older, you know, I realized there was my mom actually

258
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:39.810
Crystal Gatwood: Put my dad out there like a piece of shit and you know he didn't want us and all this. But it wasn't

259
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.510
Richelle Direny: Real you realize that he wanted to be.

260
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.880
Richelle Direny: You are read by your data.

261
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.260
Crystal Gatwood: We live with my mom.

262
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:06.120
Crystal Gatwood: That she worked all the time. And if she wasn't working. She was at the bar that we was raised by, I would say probably my grandma.

263
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:12.180
Richelle Direny: This is

264
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:23.250
Richelle Direny: Regardless of even though sometimes that my heart and it might hurt me because of your own frustration with

265
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.880
Richelle Direny: What you can do is

266
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.060
Richelle Direny: Not medical

267
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.520
Richelle Direny: About who

268
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.880
Crystal Gatwood: I don't I don't ever speak like that.

269
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:44.340
Richelle Direny: Even though you could say a whole lot of things have you can describe them a whole lot of assets and birds and everything.

270
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.700
Richelle Direny: But that's not for your

271
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.760
Richelle Direny: Time.

272
00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:03.510
Richelle Direny: Or you can do is just do the best you can. And the last thing they can't, you can't change that you can't make this that do

273
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.740
Richelle Direny: That all you can do is just a login and just provide for him and do what's right, buying. That's all you

274
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.010
Richelle Direny: Because what hurts.

275
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.650
Richelle Direny: The most is that

276
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:29.370
Richelle Direny: One you thought that the life you would have created for your children would have been different from the life growing up in

277
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:39.630
Richelle Direny: San Antonio. This is just a reminder of the life you had that, you know, so it kind of feelings of

278
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:48.540
Richelle Direny: Where you question yourself as a mom to question yourself as a person. Good question. Whole lot of things.

279
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:57.840
Richelle Direny: But everybody has their own person, because everybody wanted to. You can you can only work on that person.

280
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.000
Crystal Gatwood: Right. I try not to stress about the things that are out of my control.

281
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.430
Crystal Gatwood: It just sucks.

282
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.100
Richelle Direny: Done.

283
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:23.970
Richelle Direny: But

284
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:24.660
Richelle Direny: At least

285
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:28.650
Crystal Gatwood: At least he has me

286
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.860
Richelle Direny: Remind yourself that

287
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.340
Richelle Direny: We have you

288
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.370
Richelle Direny: And

289
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.050
Richelle Direny: We love

290
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.350
Richelle Direny: You care for him, would you go to the ends of the earth thing.

291
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.970
Absolutely.

292
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.370
Richelle Direny: To focus on the phone because the keyword and send

293
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.520
Richelle Direny: It out of your control.

294
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:03.660
Yeah.

295
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.490
Richelle Direny: And that's a little, little completely out completely out of your control. What does it out of your control.

296
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:22.200
Richelle Direny: It doesn't mean that when it doesn't mean that when you're when he does that, is that negativity of

297
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:32.970
Richelle Direny: Fun. There's not much that you can do about that. Just as long as you're meditating or home and just do the best you can.

298
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.170
Richelle Direny: It is completely out of your control.

299
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.510
Richelle Direny: We all can

300
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.820
Richelle Direny: Imagine what our lives are going to be and how different philosophy.

301
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.760
Richelle Direny: When we get older. And we realized it starts to go down the same path.

302
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.130
Richelle Direny: That how you grew up, but again,

303
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.600
Richelle Direny: Frequent a little bit and just saying, Okay, this is my reality.

304
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:11.310
Richelle Direny: This is where it is. I thought that relationship with my son father would have worked and it would have been different from my own life growing up, but it isn't.

305
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.070
Richelle Direny: So how can I be the best mom to my son.

306
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.570
Richelle Direny: How can I do what I need to do. Does it hurt.

307
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.020
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

308
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.230
Richelle Direny: Like how does

309
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.470
Richelle Direny: It.

310
00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.190
Richelle Direny: Make it doesn't matter. Of course it does.

311
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.130
Richelle Direny: All true

312
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.930
Richelle Direny: But you know what, what is

313
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:49.740
Richelle Direny: Important

314
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.500
Richelle Direny: Again,

315
00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:03.480
Richelle Direny: It's not good to overcompensate over the last

316
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.830
Richelle Direny: Crash, you can do what you can do, but over compensating for

317
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:18.150
Richelle Direny: You have no control what that will do will do a thing. But as long as

318
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.170
Richelle Direny: He knows that money on who among all

319
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.410
Richelle Direny: The all important.

320
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:32.910
Richelle Direny: Is because you can't change or stop how people feel about this, that, or the along in that

321
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:46.410
Richelle Direny: There's you can't stop or change at all you can do is just be there to be a support if he wants to talk. Let's talk if he wants to cry, just sit there and it's okay for him.

322
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.130
Richelle Direny: If he wants to express emotions and

323
00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.410
Richelle Direny: If he cries a requirement. That's fun.

324
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.170
Richelle Direny: And what's important, as long as you're looking

325
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they want to know that you're going to do them.

326
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:25.020
Richelle Direny: Because just like how to use it and realize how much of a blue part, the argument in the fight with having such an impact on home. Now that is no longer in the picture you now realize, wow, this clearly with having a big impact on

327
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.360
Crystal Gatwood: I mean, I know it was, but I just don't know how what, to what extent

328
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.290
Crystal Gatwood: But it's kind of funny.

329
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:42.480
Crystal Gatwood: That when he left he's beginning nothing but stars on his behavior chart. I mean,

330
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.490
Crystal Gatwood: That's just

331
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.500
Crystal Gatwood: It's always

332
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.650
Richelle Direny: So you make one great decision.

333
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.420
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

334
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.130
Richelle Direny: We come out.

335
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.370
Richelle Direny: Of that wasn't

336
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:10.110
Crystal Gatwood: Right. And, like, another thing too is like now I'm happy. So, and when I'm happy and he sees that I happy, he's happy like it just

337
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.050
Crystal Gatwood: I know it's weird, but

338
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:14.760
Richelle Direny: It's

339
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:16.260
Richelle Direny: Not that

340
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.090
Richelle Direny: Difficult combination of people. It hurts to do some cold, flu.

341
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:32.130
Richelle Direny: Or medical through the not having to pull together like you did.

342
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:44.280
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but the difference in your you strive to be a different mom, then the relationship you have with yours or your mom wants to

343
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.850
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and that's the part that hurts me

344
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.830
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

345
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:56.790
Richelle Direny: It's because you're having a flashback of what it was like growing up in a single parent household

346
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:06.570
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, and a lot. Like I said, all my shoe on you there. So there's a lot of times I didn't have either parents

347
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.190
Crystal Gatwood: So I feel like you know me.

348
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.200
Richelle Direny: It didn't hurt.

349
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:26.790
Richelle Direny: That hurt. I'm learning more thing here and tell you. And sometimes when you see other when you i'm sure when you were growing up in these are your friends are they had their mom or their

350
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.790
Richelle Direny: Dad, and who and who wish you had that and be there for that.

351
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:42.360
Richelle Direny: And he may go through that or do let's do that for them. But guess what, as long as you want to do it. You can't change.

352
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.030
Richelle Direny: Your situation.

353
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.050
Richelle Direny: But when you can

354
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.480
Richelle Direny: Do something about your situation.

355
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:49.980
And I do

356
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:59.760
Richelle Direny: And that's it. And you started off by removing them from toxic situation that you remove them from a toxic situation.

357
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.350
Richelle Direny: And now that you are happy, happy to keep eventually we'll see how happy.

358
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.260
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

359
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.210
Richelle Direny: But

360
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.180
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so just

361
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:28.650
Richelle Direny: Just

362
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.310
Richelle Direny: Just, just

363
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.280
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

364
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.320
Crystal Gatwood: I guess I never haven't put it in that aspect. Yet,

365
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.120
Richelle Direny: Just been going

366
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.400
Richelle Direny: So well

367
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:56.220
Crystal Gatwood: I've just been going with flow things. Let's have been a lot better though.

368
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:08.880
Crystal Gatwood: Is despite the first time I went back and looked at the situation and how it changed. You know what I mean.

369
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.060
Richelle Direny: Toxic situation.

370
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:13.770
Richelle Direny: We're getting

371
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:28.200
Richelle Direny: emotional and mental not good for your five year old child that has a voice to behave and conduct yourself in a way that is unbecoming of house the tree.

372
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:36.000
Richelle Direny: That is because you don't want the cup how big, how a child to show you how to code school in treating other kids.

373
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:54.600
Crystal Gatwood: Always tell Memphis like you know you're a gentleman I raised him as a gentleman like he opens doors for elderly people. He opens doors for any woman he opens. He comes around in my car door and opens my card or like he that's how I'm

374
00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.440
Crystal Gatwood: Raising money.

375
00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:07.830
Richelle Direny: And that's why we stay focused and now you have a clear path to continue doing that was out of pocket. So we're moving from the coffee situation you were in, we were

376
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:20.250
Richelle Direny: Probably inclusive inviting a little bit more depressed very overwhelmed. So all these things that's going on. You will move to from that and move into from that.

377
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:30.300
Richelle Direny: You, ultimately, you said, Okay, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna keep on in this relationship. So you can be there for his son, but then you notice that the behaviors were getting worse.

378
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:40.800
Richelle Direny: And it wasn't Griffin, this one. So now we will move him you're noticing all the babies are better. Oh, he's asking a little bit different. Oh, now

379
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:51.780
Richelle Direny: So if you're looking at it from that. It's kind of like what we talked about in group. So you weren't in group or head went a little bit deeper in. It was also about, you know, boom, grateful. So sometimes in

380
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.390
Richelle Direny: The bad situation in

381
00:40:54.930 --> 00:41:09.930
Richelle Direny: Those situations that are overwhelming. It's hard to see what we can be grateful for and it can be grateful for in this situation in the positive impact that it's having on every sport. You can see for right now.

382
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:17.700
Richelle Direny: How it will force of the world and a positive behavioral change for yourself.

383
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:18.990
Richelle Direny: And

384
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.180
Richelle Direny: You can say focus on right now.

385
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.540
Richelle Direny: And just continue just rewarding.

386
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:36.600
Richelle Direny: And neither he comes down to, you know, later on. He said, If my daddy and to increase throwing things out there. Remember, a lot of times, kids were facing

387
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.990
Richelle Direny: Just to get you upset because they know how

388
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:53.910
Richelle Direny: To that means that he really truly moving right. No, it just move that you're kind of pulling that you're saying that just because you won't get away with something and I'm not going to allow you to get a little

389
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:55.770
Richelle Direny: Comfortable.

390
00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:07.980
Richelle Direny: And so you kind of have to find a way to grant mercy forgiveness understand where you're coming from. But at the same time still address what unacceptable behavior is

391
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:21.390
Richelle Direny: Because what is important. The difference between you and him is that you strive to be there for him at all times, no matter what situation or circumstance.

392
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.910
Richelle Direny: You can't control.

393
00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.760
Richelle Direny: You can't make that change. You can't make that two things to do.

394
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:30.990
Right.

395
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:43.740
Richelle Direny: And having a physical body in our house that you still have the problem, do this, do ABC and D for your child. It's so overwhelming within itself.

396
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:55.590
Richelle Direny: Isn't it, we think you cry now that out of the house you longer than we thought. The key.

397
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:05.220
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

398
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.690
Crystal Gatwood: And I'll and I'll you know I that's just

399
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:18.990
Crystal Gatwood: How I am with all my relationship, you know, if all I'll leave that door open. But that's as far as I go. You know, like

400
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:28.950
Crystal Gatwood: You got to make some effort to like you got to come through that door and let me know that you're willing to have a relationship, you know,

401
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.260
Crystal Gatwood: So I've always been. I don't know why, but that's how I feel.

402
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:46.890
Crystal Gatwood: Just like with my mom, you know, I tried to make RELATIONSHIP WITH HER, SHE GAVE ME. EXCUSE after excuse. That's fine. I'll leave that door open when you want to walk through. I'm here.

403
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:04.560
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah, I've definitely learned to not stress, the things that I cannot control because it's not worth it.

404
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.470
Crystal Gatwood: It's not

405
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.740
Richelle Direny: The things we can the things we would like to control

406
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.080
Richelle Direny: That we cannot control all day long. Yeah.

407
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.320
Crystal Gatwood: In the

408
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.260
Crystal Gatwood: Long run, you know, it's just, it doesn't

409
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:31.680
Crystal Gatwood: Make it

410
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.950
Crystal Gatwood: You know, my son is older.

411
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.630
Crystal Gatwood: Will realize that

412
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.030
Crystal Gatwood: My mom was there, you know, she did the best she could just like I did.

413
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.860
Richelle Direny: It's all about how you contribute to that.

414
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.350
Richelle Direny: The important

415
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.170
Richelle Direny: Thing is

416
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:06.300
Richelle Direny: Because even though your mom was grew up with them but like I said at the end of it is at some point in time. Do you realize that. Hold on.

417
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.840
Richelle Direny: There's something yesterday about

418
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.780
Richelle Direny: My mom is not really there for me.

419
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:20.790
Richelle Direny: You started realizing what were the truth really eventually the truth will come out. The question is, are you ready

420
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.170
Crystal Gatwood: I am

421
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.490
Richelle Direny: Ready to hear the truth.

422
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.050
Richelle Direny: See it and homeless are

423
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.210
Crystal Gatwood: Really, but

424
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.720
Crystal Gatwood: I don't think anybody is really

425
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.030
Richelle Direny: But if

426
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.520
Richelle Direny: You want to

427
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:37.530
Richelle Direny: Come

428
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.400
Richelle Direny: No matter what you try to hide it will come. But all that's important, if not watching home. It's watching

429
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:49.800
Richelle Direny: Your

430
00:45:51.390 --> 00:46:02.310
Crystal Gatwood: WHEN HE ASKED YOU THINK I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL MY SON asked know to talk to those that are to seems that and then make a visitation with him or

431
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:03.900
Crystal Gatwood: Ethan

432
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.660
Richelle Direny: What do you feel comfortable

433
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:15.960
Crystal Gatwood: Well, I know he's asked about it before, but he'll ask me about it and then run off and play be fine. You know, so like I don't know what to do.

434
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:17.880
Richelle Direny: If it's

435
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.200
Crystal Gatwood: Okay, with my answer.

436
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:34.590
Crystal Gatwood: Your daddy says he's taking care of some things that he needed to take care of. And he's okay with that right now. And he'll go off his life.

437
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.650
Richelle Direny: And just leave it for what it is, I would say at this point, leaving for what it is.

438
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:52.170
Richelle Direny: If his bad. But again, that's what I would say waiting for what it is, but if his dad wants to see who wants to spend some time with him then.

439
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.740
Crystal Gatwood: He hasn't tried to call me nothing.

440
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.540
Richelle Direny: And

441
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.620
Crystal Gatwood: contacted me

442
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.150
Richelle Direny: I will enforce it.

443
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:11.400
Richelle Direny: And I wouldn't force it upon him to try to because then you're hurting yourself.

444
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:13.620
Crystal Gatwood: Right and

445
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:22.620
Richelle Direny: Then eat. Yeah because then you're forcing him to be there for his son and he doesn't really want to be there for so so that's one thing.

446
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:24.810
Richelle Direny: And

447
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:32.610
Richelle Direny: Then the other thing is you don't want to force your son.

448
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.040
Richelle Direny: To

449
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.080
Crystal Gatwood: Visitation I feel like he would be

450
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.560
Crystal Gatwood: You know, he would feel kind of awkward.

451
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:54.120
Richelle Direny: You know, people want to feel rejected because, of course, let it happen naturally. Let it happen naturally.

452
00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.370
Richelle Direny: Money, I want to talk about

453
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.820
Richelle Direny: Taxes Texans the hands of someone

454
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.640
Richelle Direny: Says no I can't see him or whatever that is.

455
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.710
Richelle Direny: Right now.

456
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.620
Richelle Direny: You're going to convert more people line and I'm going to

457
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.530
Richelle Direny: Talk to you right now simply

458
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.010
Richelle Direny: Whatever excuse me tell you that is

459
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.330
Crystal Gatwood: OK.

460
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:36.510
Richelle Direny: But you don't you don't want to force the issue on their part, especially because to down. They're impressionable. And if you force it. And then he doesn't

461
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:48.270
Richelle Direny: You force it and then you go and then the disappointment that you feel rejected by the bat then somewhat going to do or you feel like you're at fault center because we force the issue.

462
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:49.260
Yeah.

463
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.830
Richelle Direny: Yeah let everything happen natural dollar don't

464
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.040
Richelle Direny: don't foresee don't

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.200
Richelle Direny: Let me know if this time better for you to me.

466
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.380

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.680
Richelle Direny: Okay, because he's in school right now. Right.

468
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:18.030
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

469
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.010
Richelle Direny: Okay. Today's Tuesday.

470
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.700
Crystal Gatwood: It would be next Tuesday. The third

471
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.100
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to see

472
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:36.360
Richelle Direny: Let's do next. The third at

473
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.540
Richelle Direny: The same time

474
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:40.710
Here.

475
00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:52.290
Richelle Direny: Yes.

476
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.720
Yeah, okay.

477
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.760
Richelle Direny: Okay.

478
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:05.340
Richelle Direny: So I just recommend moving forward is just staying, you know, in tune on just being there for him.

479
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:15.270
Richelle Direny: And just understanding what it means to work within the things you have control.

480
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:17.070
And

481
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:27.540
Richelle Direny: If the emotions become overwhelming in one cry. I always say, God made to the Christ, use them.

482
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:40.800
Richelle Direny: You know, it's just, it's okay, it's okay to cry. It sucks. It really does. But, and it's nothing wrong with saying, hey, this sucks, but I have no control over.

483
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:46.740
Richelle Direny: This feeling was. It was, it's not going to linger on forever and forever.

484
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:48.510
Crystal Gatwood: Yeah.

485
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.290
Crystal Gatwood: All right. Well, thank you for everything.

486
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.070
Crystal Gatwood: I'm sorry I cry every time.

487
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.200
Richelle Direny: I think

488
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:19.530
Richelle Direny: It's just crossed

489
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:30.810
Richelle Direny: To the set because I think that's the other piece outside of how is the impact that we have on your son. I think it's also looking at

490
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:34.590
Richelle Direny: What does it feel for you to lose this room.

491
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.420
Richelle Direny: Okay, so we'll process back next time.

492
00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.250
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.
