00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.400
Alright.

2
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: ALRIGHT, LET'S CHECK AUDIO Can you hear me okay

3
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.300
Ray Casias: Yeah. Okay, excellent.

4
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I think I know what happened. I was doing a bio psychosocial

6
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: They took I think a little bit longer and dipped into our

7
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Our schedule and I'm sorry about that.

8
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.930
Ray Casias: No problem. No problem.

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.280
Ray Casias: I'm fine with anything like that.

10
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm not

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.810
Ray Casias: I'm easy

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.110
Ray Casias: Yeah okay well

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.560
Ray Casias: Do I have

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.520
Ray Casias: I'll be meeting with Dr. Jackson today.

15
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.340
Ray Casias: About the pain management so

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.790
What time because I'm

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Here sure about that. I saw a little message floating through that.

18
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to misspeak you're sure that it's happening.

19
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought I saw it was canceled because there weren't enough

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.170
People in there. Okay.

21
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.110
Ray Casias: Instead, rather than a group. I'll be doing a wild one.

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Great, great, great, great.

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.400
Ray Casias: And I did.

24
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.580
Ray Casias: I was almost I was running late as well because I

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.500
Ray Casias: Woke up and follow that I had a pain survey to do not that one takes a minute.

26
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.200
Ray Casias: To try to connect to Wi Fi. Yeah.

27
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not the best connection is that

28
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.580
Open here for ray

29
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.360
Ray Casias: Hear me now.

30
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

31
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How about you.

32
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.560
Ray Casias: I didn't work. Yeah, I can hear you. When I connected to Wi Fi abroad completely. So I'm not sure what's happening.

33
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, um, maybe what we'll do is have you

34
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Go had some point possibly to audio online, but let's see how long we can make it with both, okay.

35
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.250
Okay.

36
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get a note here when we got we in and what was last time we talked about goals. Let's see.

37
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.540
Hmm.

38
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Click February. So I think we're due for a little tip, tip see and how you doing,

39
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: See, and how you doing on your goals here.

40
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And after group did you give some thought to where you might want to do some volunteering or what you want to do with that.

41
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.630
Ray Casias: I looked into it. There's, there's a lot of

42
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.010
Ray Casias: Other things online. I looked into some local thing.

43
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.640
Ray Casias: There's a ton. I mean there's just a

44
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. You know, it's interesting because you'll say that and I'll hear from someone else. There's just nowhere.

45
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.160
Ray Casias: Yeah, that

46
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.670
Ray Casias: was even thinking because before that even came up

47
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.950
Ray Casias: A few weeks back, I was looking into

48
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.790
Ray Casias: I wasn't looking into volunteer, but looking in.

49
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.480
Ray Casias: Certain support groups.

50
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.280
Ray Casias: And somebody, somebody had told me there's like nothing here. Here in Albuquerque. And I like

51
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:39.030
Ray Casias: I had to, I believe so much to look to add to just stop because it's just on and on. I'm there was plenty of support groups.

52
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.610
Ray Casias: To check out there. So I, and it was the same for me with volunteers stuff that

53
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.290
Ray Casias: Gives it depends on how

54
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.110
Ray Casias: much effort you put into it. I had to play with keywords. Little bit.

55
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.010
Ray Casias: all worked out pretty good.

56
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no concern there if you want to move into doing some activities in the community. It's not an issue. You can do that.

57
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. Alright, let's scoot down here on my list of things that you want to work on. Um, we've got

58
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: increase awareness.

59
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This is definitely my I can tell this is not in a quote. So this is something I came up with.

60
00:05:49.650 --> 00:06:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't normally do that and normally it's my clients right will say something they want to do and that's kind of what we build around but I wrote, I must have written this one and it says increase awareness of what the client wants distinguished from needs.

61
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's been sort of a flow an inner weaving throughout our work together, which was

62
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, do I deserve to assert a need

63
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What about a want. I mean, heaven forbid, right. Just, just a lowly little one, but I wanted to know if you could see

64
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own things you would like to do things you'd prefer and I wanted to increase just sort of awareness around the distinction between what you need, like food, shelter, affection, right, that kind of thing.

65
00:06:48.570 --> 00:07:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And versus the things you want now just even as I'm bringing this up. How have you noticed a difference about paying attention to needs versus wants and where you are with that.

66
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.040
Ray Casias: Yeah.

67
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.720
Ray Casias: I have noticed

68
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.670
Ray Casias: The point where I am. I have to go when it comes to

69
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.910
Ray Casias: Me and wants

70
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.480
Ray Casias: To meet my wife.

71
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.070
Ray Casias: I don't know, I'm not sure.

72
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.860
Ray Casias: Like a ship because I'm

73
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.390
Ray Casias: Not having any problems just blurting it out.

74
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.000
Ray Casias: Later. So, okay, I'm just saying it.

75
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.170
Ray Casias: putting it out there and I'm not, you know, not

76
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.920
Ray Casias: So concerned with mean rejected on it. I'm just putting it out there.

77
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.860
Ray Casias: A lot more

78
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.720
Ray Casias: More

79
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.840
Ray Casias: That is a definite change.

80
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's the assert, there's the assertiveness, there's the comfort level of saying it, but what I can't quite see is Ray, do you still only mentioned need

81
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you deserve only on the need level versus I want a new top. I don't need a new top I only wear the white ones. These days it's like contagious. So

82
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't need it. But I want it.

83
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you asserting things you want I want the cherry on top.

84
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.180
Ray Casias: I don't think

85
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.250
Ray Casias: I don't think

86
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:53.970
I

87
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.280
Ray Casias: Don't want

88
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.110
Ray Casias: Like I don't

89
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.530
Ray Casias: I come, I'm pretty I'm

90
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.790
Ray Casias: Pretty simple guy. I'm pretty satisfied with

91
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.890
Ray Casias: Doesn't take a lot to do.

92
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.490
Ray Casias: It's going to take a lot to make me happy. But

93
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.250
Ray Casias: Not what I'm talking about.

94
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.250
Me.

95
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.820
Ray Casias: Happiness.

96
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.340
Ray Casias: Now this point.

97
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what's happening to you right now. Right. What does it make me think about

98
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.010
Ray Casias: Oh, it's making me think about pain.

99
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.050
Ray Casias: Because

100
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.500
Ray Casias: When I think of happiness.

101
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.490
Ray Casias: Pain is in

102
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.590
Ray Casias: direct conflict with me being happy all the time. All the time.

103
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.480
Yeah.

104
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.080
Ray Casias: But, but, but I'm exploring as I'm

105
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.410
Ray Casias: being assertive about things I want. I don't

106
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.000
Ray Casias: I think I'm still having a problem with that. I can say that because

107
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a couple things that might be difficult for you to be made easier to blurt out something you need, but it might be a little more difficult to say what you want. Once you tell me a couple things you want

108
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.850
Ray Casias: I want a

109
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.340
Ray Casias: New laptop.

110
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.590
Ray Casias: Laptop

111
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

112
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.880
Ray Casias: Beat up and

113
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

114
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, I really liked that one. I could see. I could see almost

115
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That line between you and want. So if it was me. Right.

116
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That line between need and want would be very close together because

117
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I think about you and I think I bet you do a lot of reading online and I bet, like if you were to do a blog, you would want a laptop that was functional that could

118
00:11:46.140 --> 00:12:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Process quickly, you know, that really worked well because it is pain management and you know what I mean it like I don't know that it's only a one. Like for me, if I were you, I'd be like, I don't even know which side that's on

119
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Because distraction because giving back might be tied in with this laptop know maybe it's just because I care about you that that I'm saying that but or I want. Maybe I want a new laptop and I'm projecting, I don't know.

120
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But

121
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't. That seems really

122
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.440
Important

123
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:33.330
Ray Casias: Okay, here's here. Now I'll make that clear. I want a new I want a fancy new laptop with all the

124
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.050
Ray Casias: All the tech that could be loaded with

125
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.920
Ray Casias: There we go.

126
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.040
Ray Casias: I could I could get by with

127
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.830
Ray Casias: Just the new laptop. I want

128
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:51.810
Ray Casias: I want some luck because I you know I plan on getting the blog going on and

129
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How much are they and they like an 800 900 is a deluxe thing. I don't even know.

130
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.630
Ray Casias: You know what, I don't even know either. I haven't even price anything or

131
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:04.530
Huh.

132
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:05.940
Ray Casias: Good.

133
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I

134
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: See why, why haven't you

135
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.570
Ray Casias: I don't know, because I don't think I

136
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.970
Ray Casias: Don't think it's happening right now.

137
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.350
Ray Casias: But why, but why not, no.

138
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.750
Ray Casias: I don't want to feel like

139
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.430
Ray Casias: being selfish maybe

140
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sit with that for a second.

141
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at all the things that I only named a couple of them, how critical fancy and by fancy. We're just talking about loaded with tech

142
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:06.870
Ray Casias: Yeah.

143
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.740
It was

144
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The outside was scratched and it had like bunch of scratched off stickers on it, but the tech was on there.

145
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And it had this powerhouse where it would, you know, good connections and you could do cool, you know, blogs, and it works great, but it was like

146
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know purchase on Craigslist or marketplace and it was used by a couple people. Maybe it's three years old, but it is like loaded to the gills because someone was like creating websites with it or something. Um, you would feel selfish. Is that right,

147
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.830
Ray Casias: Yes, it would depend on

148
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:58.830
Ray Casias: On the price of it because I always be totally fine with something like that be fired up with them like that.

149
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.940
Ray Casias: guess it would depend on

150
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.110
Ray Casias: What would it depend on price, of course.

151
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I would feel selfish. Let's just tease it out a little bit. This might seem silly, but let's see where it takes us. I would feel selfish. If it was 1500 dollars or 3000 which one

152
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.780
Ray Casias: Would be selfish yeah 15 1500

153
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too much.

154
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.450
Ray Casias: Yeah, that would be

155
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

156
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.000
Ray Casias: How about 500 500 would be fine. I think

157
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.850
Ray Casias: There would be okay.

158
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:53.010
Ray Casias: How about 550 50 is okay.

159
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How about 600

160
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.890
Ray Casias: Hundred on pushing it there.

161
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.500
Ray Casias: Quite a bit.

162
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me hold on yourself. Now where should that $50 go besides you

163
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:27.480
Ray Casias: Oh,

164
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.150
Ray Casias: Now even know

165
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.300
Ray Casias: My daughter is like handling shit. I know.

166
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:48.750
Ray Casias: I'm 50 bucks to be like such a blessing to her out of nowhere for like a

167
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:50.820
Good stuff.

168
00:16:52.320 --> 00:17:02.490
Ray Casias: She's putting she's working hard and she's responsible with our money now so 50 bucks right there would be like

169
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.580
Ray Casias: Would feel really good.

170
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

171
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.780
Ray Casias: Or I mean I

172
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.500
Ray Casias: I'm just so

173
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.760
Ray Casias: I am so in love with that boy and

174
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:32.430
Ray Casias: So every, every month. I gotta get something that he needs and something that just want fun

175
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.760
Ray Casias: Do that.

176
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:40.710
Ray Casias: What

177
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.460
Ray Casias: And you know i'm not i'm thinking about it and I'm thinking, well, if I plan it

178
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:01.440
Ray Casias: And I don't just go, just go do it all just out of nowhere. I mean, why not

179
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:11.190
Ray Casias: Save it were a couple months and then go get it and not selfish would have been neglecting anything

180
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.070
Ray Casias: Why not

181
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me all the things that you would benefit from just indulge in it. So I mentioned a couple of them.

182
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about what this would give you if you had a real badass laptop.

183
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.740
Ray Casias: presence and power.

184
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.550
Ray Casias: The

185
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.490
Ray Casias: Storage capacity. I mean, I've got

186
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.630
Ray Casias: So many different things that I could be working on all at once. If I had

187
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.410
Ray Casias: The processing in the storage that I want.

188
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.090
Ray Casias: All the

189
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.710
Ray Casias: All the tech that allows for just ease of

190
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.540
Ray Casias: Developing everything

191
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:50.040
Ray Casias: I could get a lot of a lot of work done. I like to see my desk. I've got like 1000 things on my desk just going on at once.

192
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.540
Ray Casias: I could put that into a computer that has

193
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:02.790
Ray Casias: The power to deal with it. And I could work on. I could I could switch from

194
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:14.040
Ray Casias: Whatever, I'm working on. I could work on whatever I want to with ease and switch, switch

195
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:22.410
Ray Casias: And that type. That's what I'm looking for, because I feel like I would get a lot more done if I didn't have to

196
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:33.660
Ray Casias: Go through an ordeal to switch between work and to find what I'm looking for. And

197
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, do you, do you have a Facebook.

198
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. So I'm going to show you something.

199
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show you. I ran across this because I always gone to Craigslist, because I, and then they're like, oh yeah.

200
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This is scary people in there. You don't need to go there. Go to marketplace on your Facebook. Well, I'm not really much of a Facebook or

201
00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But I was like, Well, maybe I will be. What's this all about, well, because then you get to see the people you can like, you know, judge him like, Oh, you look like you're not going to kill me in the parking lot.

202
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

203
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way to tell, but so here's what i don't know how do you

204
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you type in, like is there a. Is it a Macintosh you want. Is it Adele is it do you care, like how many. What's the process power. What's the number of storage megabyte business that you want. Like, this is what you type in, and you'd see different options.

205
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what do you, what are your minimum requirements.

206
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.410
Ray Casias: So,

207
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.780
Ray Casias: Why were to do this.

208
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.260
Ray Casias: I would ask the

209
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.730
Ray Casias: Research the tech

210
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.770
Ray Casias: Available.

211
00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.910
Ray Casias: And then come up with some

212
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.540
Ray Casias: Come up with some

213
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.550
Ray Casias: Some brands that that the tech is available. And then I was

214
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:15.720
Ray Casias: Great looking in Craig, or what. So, this is this is Facebook.

215
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Facebook. So there's this thing over here. Lucy, you got to see me. It's going to be your home friends and then. So here, this whole thing. I think when you go home.

216
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll see not there. Go home here know it so it's home, you'll see over on the left to see name newsfeed messenger. Watch. Don't know what these things are. But anyway, marketplace.

217
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If so, here's the thing. This is what I noticed because someone else I knew tried to do this and they tried to get on there quickly know

218
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to have been in there for a while. So if your wife has an account better that you use hers, or a friend's

219
00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter's or something because they may not let you on there. If you've just signed on, which is kind of a good thing, because remember, I WAS TELLING YOU DON'T WANT TO MEET. MEET A mass murder. Murder.

220
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.770
Ray Casias: Yeah yeah

221
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you won't be able to get to marketplace easily if

222
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't had it for a while. So you may want to talk to somebody who has had a Facebook from it and you can kind of jump on there and poke around.

223
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: As

224
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.440
Ray Casias: Well, so I think I need to research.

225
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:32.610
Ray Casias: Because I'm I'm aware. I'm AWARE THAT since I've since I've known like the last time. I've known

226
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:43.440
Ray Casias: Well what all the advances are in in laptop tech to spend a long time ago and I haven't even

227
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.970
Ray Casias: allowed myself to check it out.

228
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.890
Ray Casias: Yeah, because I know I would just want one. It really badly.

229
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.750
Ray Casias: So, um, so I haven't really I don't

230
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:08.220
Ray Casias: I know a little bit of stuff just from add you know and I know if I were to research it I could find. I could quickly find

231
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.860
Ray Casias: What is the most

232
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.670
Ray Casias: So here's something

233
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here. So this is a Mac Book Pro 13 Retina display. I know that's fancy I have, I have a big fancy one that I'm looking at right now. Right. That was a big investment for me.

234
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And it has this Retina display. But if you're not doing graphic arts and frankly I don't even think it makes that big of a difference. So I don't know that that's necessarily important but this thing you were talking about the processor you when you do you're

235
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: finding out about words like that.

236
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.100
Ray Casias: How many gigabytes. Oh.

237
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, things like that.

238
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.120
Ray Casias: That's the main thing right there.

239
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so if you buy a new 1300, it would be based model way slower. This was over two grand this guy says they want 750 for it.

240
00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Yeah, so I'm

241
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your number isn't that far off. And all I did was open up one just now and I'm pretty clueless. I let someone else handle all the tech part I just say, Listen, this is what I want to be able to do and it isn't much

242
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But at one point I was using Final Cut, which is an editing program and and Photoshop and they, you know, we needed to have like a big enough, I guess processor in order to do it.

243
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But exactly what you said. But notice how you said, I haven't even looked it up because I know all want it.

244
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.080
Ray Casias: Yeah yeah

245
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.150
Ray Casias: Okay guys talking my language right here.

246
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

247
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.830
Awesome deal

248
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not mess around. So you right so you get a little picture. And if you wanted to see who Bruno bit Betancourt is you would you could click on him.

249
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And looks like Bruno.

250
00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Sells computers because look, he's got all these marketplace listings of 19 looks like he's used to selling he may have a little side biz.

251
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: See, it's not even his name. So maybe what he does is he gets computers. Maybe he referred for vicious them or something because I can't see his face. But, oh, there we go. He looks like maybe he's a kid. So, you know, I mean, I can like, look at him. I can say, Who is this dude.

252
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.810
Ray Casias: Yeah.

253
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a kid, I was a little kid little kid. Um, and he lives, you know, looks like somewhere. I don't know where he lives Fort Lauderdale. Maybe he says what this

254
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like in California. So who knows. Anyway, but you get the idea. So this is, it's a very different thing than Craigslist. Anyway, where you have no idea who's going to be knocking at your door meeting, yet you know Dunkin Donuts or something.

255
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.130
But

256
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, we're talking about what you want.

257
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what just happened.

258
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It just got kind of real didn't it, I brought in through it in your face, you're like, I didn't even want to look at this now. I went done it and I put it in front of you.

259
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's happening now. Yeah.

260
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.170
Ray Casias: Now, you get it.

261
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.850
Ray Casias: Yeah.

262
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:25.380
Ray Casias: Because I will. Um, yeah, just that one thing right there. You know, I'm gonna

263
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.450
Ray Casias: Do this.

264
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep listening that I know you'll do on your own, which is time consuming to which means like, if that's a great distraction being this exquisite shopper. I want to check this and this and this and this and this and this.

265
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You could spend all your time shopping and really getting it just so and then you're going to shop for a good deal that has all these things that could be nice and time consuming. Those are really great

266
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.690
Ray Casias: Destruction, man. Yeah, I'll make I'll make a big old price.

267
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I want

269
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:54.660
Ray Casias: You

Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear your list of how that's going to affect let me hit some domains of life here, spiritual, I'll just throw some down here, spiritual, I'll say life satisfaction. I'll put recovery. I'll put can't forget grandchildren. I should have put that one first. My bad grandchildren daughter.

271
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.260
I'll say self esteem.

272
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say marriage gonna say it. Say it. I'm gonna say

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So real quick, just indulge me try to catch your first response how having a functional write a check loaded laptop. How Will it enhance your spirituality. Is there any connection there for you.

274
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how

275
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You can write the blog. Now you're connecting with people around the globe. You can do an A or na online.

276
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're connecting with people for a lot of people that spirit mean that spirituality that connection with people is the spiritual connection. It's I'm not isolated. I'm not suffering alone. You can be constantly sort of connecting

277
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

278
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I satisfaction. What about that one.

279
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.420
Ray Casias: Yeah, it is a great impact that

280
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.990
Ray Casias: Satisfaction. To me, you know, to get things done.

281
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.000
Ray Casias: And that would

282
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.400
Ray Casias: go a long way.

283
00:29:53.970 --> 00:30:03.330
Ray Casias: Yeah, you know, not only just having the power to get things done. I think the novelty of it at first I was into it.

284
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.190
Ray Casias: Getting it done. I got a new computer and thought

285
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.230
Ray Casias: Oh,

286
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.040
Ray Casias: Yeah, cool.

287
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're probably having some specifics in mind, right, you probably have these little projects or things that you're picturing

288
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But in general, since you're, you're not naming them it would improve life satisfaction, you'd say, right.

289
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

290
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about your recovery, how would it enhance your recovery.

291
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.100
Ray Casias: Um, I forgot pain mentioned pain.

292
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.850
Ray Casias: One of the, one of the

293
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:10.560
Ray Casias: Most important things in my recovery right now is being able to help others.

294
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:19.290
Ray Casias: So that would that would get me closer to starting out blog or

295
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.500
Ray Casias: Something along the line, I've got, I've got a

296
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.960
Ray Casias: double bar things

297
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.930
Ray Casias: That I could organize and make them available to people.

298
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.520
Ray Casias: So,

299
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.160
Ray Casias: Just being able to help

300
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.820
Ray Casias: Other other addicts.

301
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.710
Ray Casias: Would be amazing.

302
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.740
Yeah, I'm saying

303
00:31:54.570 --> 00:32:00.300
Ray Casias: Like a stepping stone in my recovery that I need to get to accomplish. I need to

304
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the word you chose

305
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You just ran across and he he date.

306
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So need it.

307
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to help others in order to help myself.

308
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's what that that whole group was about it can just do so many things getting back. We've already touched on it.

309
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's been a challenge. There's been barriers to it and I couldn't quite see it couldn't see what it was.

310
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not sure I still really know what it is, but if it happens to be this particular resource I think building this list, let's let's keep doing it, though, before I open my big mouth. Let's talk about pain.

311
00:32:48.060 --> 00:33:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back up to pain. Want You To Think for a moment. How might having a tech loaded laptop help treat help reduce pain.

312
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:02.730
Ray Casias: Of them.

313
00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:10.260
Ray Casias: Just distraction major distraction does not only from

314
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.190
Ray Casias: Getting the work done.

315
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:23.100
Ray Casias: Like I say, the novelty of it, checking it out and seeing what what what I can do with it.

316
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:36.120
Ray Casias: How enhance all of my regular activities will be on me. Major distraction. Yeah, okay.

317
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But now grandchildren. How am I it enhance. Think about if your needs for connection generativity are being addressed your life satisfaction is higher, you now have an outlet for almost immediate distraction education.

318
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Helping others. How do you think that might

319
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: contribute meaningfully to your relationship with your grandchildren.

320
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.330
Ray Casias: That one.

321
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is easy for me, man. I can see all of it.

322
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you

323
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: can't maintain distraction. If you can't address this pain if you don't feel like you're giving back. If you don't feel connected to people. I watched you get very depressed.

324
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to be around to be with your kids are you going to recognize how much you enjoy them. If you're so depressed that you don't want to get out of bed.

325
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your happiness matters, right.

326
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It matters to a lot of people

327
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.230
Ray Casias: That is an important

328
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.620
Ray Casias: That it was important for me to hear

329
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.230
Ray Casias: That it's something that I

330
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.420
Ray Casias: Didn't

331
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.500
I don't

332
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.880
Ray Casias: Doesn't it doesn't

333
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.010
Ray Casias: Not something I would have thought of on my own.

334
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like a no doubt. Like I feel like I'm insulting you

335
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not the case. You may be needed to hear, it sounds like

336
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:43.830
Ray Casias: Me, dear.

337
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.500
Ray Casias: God if

338
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.340
Ray Casias: I mean, it really is not something I would have

339
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.800
Ray Casias: That would have occurred to me.

340
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.860
Ray Casias: Or I wouldn't have even been taught that

341
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.760
Ray Casias: deserves some attention.

342
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's an easier one, how might this help

343
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Your self esteem if you had this machine and you could do all those things. We've just barely touched on. How might your self esteem go up.

344
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.050
Ray Casias: Well, I know that I would

345
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.520
Ray Casias: I would

346
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.660
Ray Casias: Say, I know what I have this

347
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.220
Ray Casias: Feeling that I would become a lot more productive than I am right now.

348
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.700
Ray Casias: What would

349
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.950
Be

350
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.770
Ray Casias: An excellent move because I feel like my productivity right now in

351
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.830
Ray Casias: La I'm not very productive.

352
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.700
Ray Casias: I can't blame everything on the pain.

353
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.880
Ray Casias: The pain dubstep my willpower away, but I've been stronger.

354
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.740
In the past,

355
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:26.220
Ray Casias: Pain hasn't changed all that much. It's gotten somewhat worse but hasn't changed all that much. And I've been

356
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.440
Ray Casias: I've been more

357
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.070
Ray Casias: Able to

358
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:39.420
Ray Casias: Accomplish more or push myself more in the past. So I feel like

359
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.350
Ray Casias: My productivity sucks right now.

360
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.630
Ray Casias: And that would be

361
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.670
Ray Casias: Sort of a boon to

362
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.060
Ray Casias: My creativity because I would be

363
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:06.360
Ray Casias: I would have some tech to play around with. And I could explore my creativity as well, which is something that I

364
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.350
Ray Casias: It was all the cookbook cognitive issues.

365
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.600
Ray Casias: Neurological crap my creativity is something that I

366
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.810
Ray Casias: Noticed the big

367
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:33.330
Ray Casias: Deficit bother it bothered me a couple years already. So that would be great, you know,

368
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I didn't help your daughter, your relationship with your daughter. Can you see the connective tissue.

369
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.770
Ray Casias: Oh man, I would need my daughter.

370
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:57.060
Ray Casias: Help me through it. Some of it because she's, she's not she is savvy tech savvy.

371
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.040
Ray Casias: Way more so than I am. That would be

372
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to to bond over really neutral and okay

373
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

374
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: He gets to feel smart and like she's giving back to you and you get to accept her help and neat. Um, what about the marriage. How might this help the marriage.

375
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever marriages and it

376
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.670
Ray Casias: Just yeah that's

377
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.880
Ray Casias: That's a tough one, because that would be

378
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.970
Ray Casias: That would be

379
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.670
Ray Casias: Where I would be worried

380
00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.460
Ray Casias: That would be where the

381
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.490
Ray Casias: That would be an external source for the

382
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:54.600
Ray Casias: Might be selfish there cuz I know it would come up. I know it would come up right now. This is

383
00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the Achilles heel right here it's being judged either by her family as you being selfish, we just we found it.

384
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.660
Ray Casias: Yeah.

385
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.670
Ray Casias: And and then

386
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.500
Ray Casias: You

387
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.730
Ray Casias: So I'm

388
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.790
Ray Casias: Just

389
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.220
Ray Casias: Wrapped up in all that in there. I know that.

390
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.870
Ray Casias: We should be influenced to think that way. I know it.

391
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.750
Ray Casias: I can confidently say that

392
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.020
Ray Casias: She's been in so many other things.

393
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's hear

394
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear back at yourself so

395
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though it would

396
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Be reducing the experience in Argentina the distress level of pain Through distraction through immersion.

397
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of doing not only day to day organizational things but blogging or creative writing or certain pieces of things that you want to learn about it would be helping the pain.

398
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be a spiritual connection, you're connecting with people around the world, or maybe through just maybe just through the blogging. I don't even know you might develop friendships through there. Don't know might be part of that.

399
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting back to the community part your life satisfaction would go up, it would be addressing a need, which is

400
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting this recovery goals really high on that right, you'd be addressing your recovery goals. It's a need

401
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: weren't able to quite get to the grandchildren, but your daughter up connecting with your daughter be some kind of fun to kind of play with together, it would help your self esteem.

402
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:52.800
But

403
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd be called selfish.

404
00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: By a group of people that you've already mentioned.

405
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not not well.

406
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably thinking very seriously about moving away from

407
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's being selfish really

408
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see it.

409
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see

410
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That if you have the ability to really, that's why I kind of pushed the idea of really listing these out. We didn't skip any any opportunity to be very clear.

411
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not

412
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.090
gluttonous

413
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.080
Right.

414
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't gluttonous this, this doesn't seem like excess. To me, this sounds like the very medicine that you need.

415
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.130
Ray Casias: Yeah, well, I turned off my my video kind of freezing up

416
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.190
Now,

417
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I astray. I want you to have this list, I'm not particular how you get distraction helping others getting things done making sure that you're giving back so that your need in your recovery is being met.

418
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That you get to play with your grandkids and connect with your daughter feel productive. I don't really care how you do it.

419
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If you tell me, it can be through this other widget. It's not this laptop. Okay, I'm not really hung up on how but these things seem important and I do not

420
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear that you're being selfish what I hear is, you didn't choose the pain right

421
00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're trying to carve out some life satisfaction in a really crummy situation.

422
00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I cannot see how it's selfish.

423
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you tell me

424
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, if it's your wife is homeless and there's, you know, you're the only person providing food in this House, I suppose we could argue that point, we could maybe

425
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of go there, but your life, your depression, your, your self esteem is is at stake here. I, I don't see how how we don't throw everything we possibly can, at that to try to get that life satisfaction up

426
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're facing physical pain. I mean,

427
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Destruction.

428
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.990
Yeah, like, okay.

429
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.480
Ray Casias: I know that old joke. I see what you did there.

430
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.130
Ray Casias: Because yeah listing it out this way.

431
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Listing it out.

432
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What is she really so right. The flip side is. What can someone really say you're being selfish. Because what because the month because why sample part of the family is going to save that money money should have gone where what's their argument.

433
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.390
Ray Casias: Right.

434
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.380
Ray Casias: And I don't know. I don't even know what it was.

435
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.970
Ray Casias: So bizarre to me at time

436
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:43.020
Ray Casias: Um, but even then, if I worked on it and get it done within a couple of months and even more so what

437
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.420
Ray Casias: Was the problem.

438
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:57.570
Ray Casias: You know, if I if I see to it that I neglect nothing to get it done and even more so, what, what the heck can they say about it.

439
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.340
Ray Casias: Well,

440
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.600
Now,

441
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Crazy people can always make something up that

442
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You prepare yourself for that.

443
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.400
Ray Casias: But yeah but but that would that would that would sort of, um,

444
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.390
Ray Casias: Well, prove it to me that there's

445
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:22.770
Ray Casias: Whatever they're going to say is going to be crazy. And who knows, maybe they won't say anything, but I doubt that I highly doubt that

446
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:29.250
Ray Casias: But at least though I've proven to myself there anything makes a faceless

447
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK. So the approach.

448
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To justifying considering it.

449
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I might not be coming from the same place, but

450
00:46:44.790 --> 00:47:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that you even said it out loud that you sat with me and you let me kind of help you articulate the pros of having this and you are a little short on your ability to argue back on why it's a bad idea. Aside from your projection of someone thinking you're selfish and

451
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A big piece of our work together is for you.

452
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To focus on the self. So I don't see. I can't see what the problem really is because to me it's the medicine that you need. You've heard it in groups to people need to engage in self care, you have a whole lifetime of giving and providing for others and

453
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I

454
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.290
Ray Casias: It's an idea that we can that we might want to talk about next time.

455
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

456
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:48.570
Ray Casias: Forget about it. What this was bringing up to me because it's absolutely true, what you're saying and

457
00:47:50.580 --> 00:48:01.650
Ray Casias: My wife, my wife would not agree with any of it and she doesn't see that that it's true even if I were to tell her and explain it to her at this point.

458
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:11.340
Ray Casias: does not understand any of it. I mean, I'm still I'm still an addict and I'm still

459
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:17.130
Ray Casias: I'm using some block tone right now and disconcert

460
00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.600
Ray Casias: Until it. Feel it. Feel

461
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.350
Ray Casias: That is beginning to build a bit hopeless and trying to

462
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:30.990
Ray Casias: Get the truth.

463
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.010
Ray Casias: Through to her and make her see that

464
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.960
You know,

465
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:42.930
Ray Casias: Doesn't take seriously the thing that I'm going to do.

466
00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want

467
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: My next clients here. Right. But I want to really write down what you're talking about. So we can pick it right back up. What do you want me to write down

468
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this just sounds like what you've always been doing which is subjugating you're on once

469
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:11.040
Ray Casias: Well, this, this right here is about is, um,

470
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:18.270
Ray Casias: She doesn't take seriously any any of my condition.

471
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:27.930
Ray Casias: Or or and if I if I say I'm depressed. I'm just sad to get over it. If I say

472
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:39.210
Ray Casias: I'm terrified of this condition called to death that, you know, I've tried to talk with her about a million times that we've actually both in warned about from the neurologist.

473
00:49:40.470 --> 00:50:00.150
Ray Casias: It terrifies me. It scares the heck out of me and couldn't care less about it. She wouldn't even, you know, because it doesn't mean anything or and I don't expect it to mean to her what it means to be, but I would have expected at least try to understand that fear.

474
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I wrote that down ready okay it's deeply connected to the things we're already doing.

475
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you continue to make decisions based on your fear.

476
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It continues to reinforce that you are not enough.

477
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What you need what you want what you perceive isn't just right isn't correct continue to reinforce it.

478
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you decide to manifest in real time as in a material thing or something. We say like it's out someone could measure it to this thing happened to that thing happen if you decide to put it out there, the kind of the way you've been blurting out what you need.

479
00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be like that.

480
00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It reinforces you are enough

481
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Again and again and again up goes to self esteem, but you're waiting for her. She is not well I can hear what you're saying this is a woman who is

482
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Either either. I'm so snowed by and you're selling the strips and you really don't have any conditions and I'm just the biggest sucker that ever stood in front of a

483
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: video camera which I certainly hold out that that's a possibility. Um, but

484
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, barring that,

485
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I am saying that the crux of what's going on because you say the same thing over and over, she she cannot see you anymore. She only sees

486
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The old survival survival mechanisms that she had when she was in childhood. She's back in them living in that house and you're waiting for her to give you approval.

487
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: She can't. And that's the part that I can't seem to overcome.

488
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There will be no me persuading her there will not be not well she's living there.

489
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be massive for her to snap.

490
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because her family is right there. They're the ones that are providing a place to live. She's gonna buy into their BS in order to stay there.

491
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't want to do it and it's it's toxic for you and be toxic for me too, I rather live in my car, I wouldn't, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't do it.

492
00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I just

493
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Crazy made me crazy and won't go crazy. Don't make me crazy.

494
00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I like congratulating right and when I feel it's off, I get all like twitchy

495
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I wanted all lined up, you know, get your face is saying you hate me. You're saying nice things but but your body looks like you're mad at me. What's going on over there.

496
00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I gotta check it out. I want things to be all lined up, but it takes for personal to be able to say

497
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No, there's something missing congruent. I feel it. It's real. I've got to address this and you're in that you're still immersed in questioning your own impression your own intuition about what you're seeing with her and it showed up just now today with this laptop.

498
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So spend some time kind of seeing

499
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you rather have this false impression of you floating around, which is that yourself. And she said, No, you're not. But you'd rather have that you'd rather preserve this image of you.

500
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point that you die.

501
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand, yes.

502
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's that that's why I brought up self esteem spirituality recovery depression.

503
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it, it for everybody. It's, you know, laptop, who, you know, whatever.

504
00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But you need it for pain management, you need it because it's a place for you because you're not as ambulatory as someone else. So this is your mobile medicine. I don't think it's the it's not the same as what he needs it, for she can get around.

505
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I don't see it the same way, she does.

506
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This is it's a different piece of medicine for you than it is for someone else. Okay.

507
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to see it our way.

508
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.660
Ray Casias: And you're going to have

509
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.040
Leave yourself.

510
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, and a lot of people go through what you're going through. They're going to have to trust, you're going to have to trust your own intuition on this, you're going to be

511
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be lonely, for a moment, they'll be screaming, they'll be antics in front of you and people will call you names, but guess what you'll be happier.

512
00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll notice that you have happier days that you have more to give to other people in the community. You'll be connected. You'll be playful with grandkids, you'll have more to talk to about with your daughter, you'll have a deeper connection to a broader group, you won't feel alone.

513
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I if you've got another way to do it. Fine. It's not the laptop. It might be something else. But the notion that you're being selfish is not grounded in logic, unless you're really got to tell me someone starving and this $500 is because someone's starving.

514
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:39.300
Give it

515
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Give it some think okay, this guy's gonna get mad.

516
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:54.480
Ray Casias: I will, I will, in everything you just said is everything I want. So I gotta make it happen. Thank you.

517
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome.

518
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.190
Ray Casias: So, um,

519
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:02.040
Ray Casias: I will see you in group and

520
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll do something, then why do that.

521
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:07.260
Ray Casias: Yeah yeah

522
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.800
Ray Casias: Yeah, I'll be there.

523
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.780
Ray Casias: I'll be there, barring some

524
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.840
Ray Casias: Catastrophe I'll be there.

525
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.140
Ray Casias: Look forward to it. Thank you.

526
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Drama over here. Hi.

527
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me.

528
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

529
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I owe you an apology for being tardy I was standing right here looking at your name over there.

530
00:56:50.880 --> 00:57:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes humans just, we just don't wrap up right right on the hour and I am sorry for whatever part contributed. But just know in your heart that that time that you spent sitting here waiting for me.

531
00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You are giving to someone truly giving okay just, I know you sacrifice time and convenience, but you were really giving

532
00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:15.390
Ramon: Someone told us.

533
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:24.060
Ramon: Know you literally had like 60 more seconds. And I was going to be like we can have a 45 minute session. So we're going to have to reschedule.

534
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:32.100
Ramon: But you made it just in time I gave you a 15 minute span and you made that 15 minute window. So it's all right. I don't mind.

535
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I take that in Ramon, what does it like to hear that it wasn't. I was going shopping, but someone really needed

536
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:52.680
Ramon: Well, I figured that's what it was because you're really never late so it had to be I figured that's what it was. Because you're normally on time so okay so

537
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's been a very long time. I

538
00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just connected with the having been meeting on a regular basis. How have you been doing

539
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:12.990
Ramon: Good so far so good. I've been really happy with myself a having a kid. So I'm super excited

540
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:25.590
Ramon: Everything's changed a lot like we hardly argue at all. Now I'm really, I guess you can say, consider it over now.

541
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:38.340
Ramon: Especially not as she's pregnant. So I think the baby kind of changed a lot in me. I felt this presence in me that I never felt before.

542
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.780
Ramon: Where I had a I knew I had to change my life.

543
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:52.890
Ramon: You know what I mean. I have like it before I knew I had to. I had her daughter, which is my daughter. Also it stuff. But when it's your kid.

544
00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:56.040
Ramon: Now, I guess it's a little different.

545
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like spiritual right

546
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:04.530
Ramon: So I guy. I'm getting myself together. I'm trying to go quick fast and in a hurry.

547
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

548
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to support you in any way that we can here.

549
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know it's been a minute. So let me just see if we need to close goals open new ones because you say you kind of have

550
00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Your been doing well and a lot of ways. Let's just see if some of these goals are outdated and we can close them, we can write achieved and we can open up new ones. Number one,

551
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to work on my anger. One of the things that I wrote out was client will learn thought stopping technique. So just as I say that. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about. What thought stopping is. Do you know what that is.

552
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:49.980
Ramon: Yeah, like when you told me to think oh so most when you like do the mirroring and like stop talking about a subject maybe talk about how she feels

553
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I like those. Those are awesome. Don't lose them thought stopping is a very specific thing and you saw my hand just now went like this.

554
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Well, no, you're doing it when let's say the voice you call it criminal logical thinking in here. I call it the addict voice.

555
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll know it when you do this, you, you, you argue back to it and you score your nice to it. I don't know how your inner voice. But you say thank you for sharing.

556
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you say, Screw you. I don't know how you talk to your inner voice. But thank you for sharing you've gotten me here so far. Thank you. But I've got this and you stop the entertaining what it has to say.

557
01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I kid you not, it literally feels like that you stop contributing evidence to why that thought might be true, you

558
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because normally you'll consider it you'll think about the pros and cons of using or PUNCHING SOMEONE. I don't know what your thing is, but whatever it is, you'll you used to entertain it not stuffing is a firm. No.

559
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.210
Ramon: You don't know. Yeah, you

560
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.850
Ramon: Know, I've been doing lately. A lot

561
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not stopping

562
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.780
Ramon: Yeah, I've been doing that a lot of a

563
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.040
Fantastic.

564
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: In other words, when the list and you can think of it like this on the list of ways to deal with something I'm

565
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them was calling a few different names. Your connects that you might connect with those names are way at the bottom, those people. It's like you're going to go through

566
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh man, I need to breathe now appears, I need to breathe. I need to remember that I feel I gotta identify what do I really want right now. Um,

567
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this a me problem or her problem. What do I need shoes curiosity over being right like you're thinking all these other things you're learning hopefully in this program and elsewhere, your friends, etc.

568
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But a connect the voice of an addict is way down at the bottom, but when it does show up, you do this you don't entertain it

569
01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You can flip it. The bird, stick it

570
01:01:55.740 --> 01:02:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, now you got it. Alright, sweet. And you notice you are doing it beautiful Nan and then develop flexible cognitive self talk rehearsal learn skills upon

571
01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is a really complicated Objective I wrote out

572
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a question for you. And this is going to get right at what your self talk sounds like when you make a mistake, whatever it is at work.

573
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: At home you forgot something. You broke something. You spilled something. Whatever it is, and a mistake, not a manipulation. We did it on purpose to get even talking about straight up mistake. What do you say to yourself.

574
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.000
Oops.

575
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay. All right. I like it. Oops.

576
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's go down here to the 1500. One of the things that you wanted to do was I want to say 1500 dollars so I can get a place

577
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: To place.

578
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:58.290
Ramon: Yes, I thought. So we're going to close that one.

579
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And happy beautiful and. Next one we have I want help with addiction to heroin, obviously, that's the big one, probably the reason why you came here and I was saying okay 10 group. Yeah, that's true, that's true. Let's go down to this. Go down to this one. I want to be mentally stronger.

580
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I had asked that you identify barriers, causing emotional, cognitive, behavioral challenges. And what did you say

581
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You have said in the past. Let's see, sometime in February February 5 doing pretty good broke down, mentally, I can do this. No, I can't do this no more. I don't want to

582
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to work, no more. I'm tired of paying bills. Okay. I remember that low moment. I remember that tired of paying bills and and owing money. Maybe I cried that day the belief of the time I'm a quitter worried. I can't pay a bill. I might lose everything. I worked for

583
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you remembered I might have more problems.

584
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To kind of remember that point.

585
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.060
Ramon: I remember exactly what you're talking

586
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: About a month ago.

587
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.840
Ramon: Yeah, I remember that day.

588
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, now

589
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see the connective tissue between I identify as having a heroin addiction or dependence, however, however you word it heroin and that moment of wanting to give up. Do you see how they're connected

590
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.500
Ramon: Yeah, okay.

591
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have the thought, this is hard because it's gonna might even get harder. Right now I've got another

592
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Obligation I've got this baby that's coming. And you probably have expectations about what you're supposed to do and other people are going to dump their expectations on you and it's going to get even more sort of loaded right

593
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.400
Yeah.

594
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that I can use heroin.

595
01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Further away. Is it further down. Is it gone. Is it closer

596
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:21.450
Ramon: And this is pretty much all gone. Like there's days where I might even it didn't even day I might be thinking, taking like a painkiller. You know what I mean, not even hell but

597
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:26.100
Ramon: I'm doing really good like I don't even really think about it.

598
01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear that one more time because Member Telehealth. Sometimes I don't hear everything just right. I want to hear the one part about the pill. Did you say there are times when you've had a difficult day and you have thought about taking a pain pill or you have not

599
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.840
Ramon: I have

600
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when was that give me that story. Just tell me what was going on.

601
01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:56.160
Ramon: I don't know. I was, I just thought about it. It was just a thought I popped up in my head while I was driving home. It wasn't even something that lasted all day, or it was just like a little five minute

602
01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:57.750
Ramon: Little

603
01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:01.590
Ramon: Came in when yeah okay but it

604
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't a build up of member that fit that February date where all the bill.

605
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:10.560
Ramon: hits you hard every day you know isn't like that.

606
01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This was just a random trigger craving thing that

607
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:13.500
Ramon: You're

608
01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Wandering in. Okay, got it. That's not the same one. This is the one that I'm keeping an eye on those. You're always going to have them.

609
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to think about something that I haven't thought about 15 years going to come out of nowhere and I'll be like, though. That's just weird and off it goes. But this one, the one where you start to feed it like

610
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.660
Ramon: I haven't had one of those

611
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

612
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The real test is if you've had more bills on top of more bills. In other words, the stresses in your life. Continue. And you notice, what are you doing instead to handle those stressors. Now tell me what you're doing, instead

613
01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.510
Ramon: Just paid my bills.

614
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.600
Ramon: Really much the only thing I can do. And then I go home and relax. That's it.

615
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had any test, like, oh, I think you have maybe right you had a surgery where there are days where you couldn't work as much where you notice that the income was going down.

616
01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:21.630
Ramon: Where you've had to do.

617
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It, what did you do in your mind.

618
01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To not go to, I could use a pill.

619
01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.940
Ramon: Just another humping a road that ain't

620
01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:34.260
Much

621
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:47.820
Ramon: Like I'm doing really good now going, I don't know if I made that clear, like I am like, I'm not the same addict that I was when I first started

622
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:48.630
Yeah.

623
01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:53.370
Ramon: I feel really good.

624
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Just go back up here a little bit. I think we had about that. Yes, there we go. So, um,

625
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you use what I'm calling. Now I've dropped the box breathing, because I want people to remember the belly part. So I call it belly breathing. Um, how often are you doing it and it's helping when you are in a distress moment.

626
01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:32.580
Ramon: Um,

627
01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:36.600
Ramon: I do it.

628
01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:38.610
Ramon: Really when

629
01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:52.410
Ramon: I don't know, I guess when I'm driving like say if I get into a stress moment or something. I might go to the car and go drive to the store some and just breathe. I'm in the car.

630
01:08:53.100 --> 01:09:04.380
Ramon: Or go to the bathroom or some just look in the mirror and brief but that's really how I guess I've been handling a lot of things lately. It's just

631
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:24.330
Ramon: Only because she's pregnant and it's my baby. You know, so I've been letting her just go wild, pretty much, not too crazy but say whatever you want is fine. I still love you. You know what I mean, like, it's different now. It's really, I like the way it is. She has freedom. I can see the

632
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:33.270
Ramon: The joy in her eyes now where she's able to just say what she wants to say without having to worry about saying the wrong thing.

633
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.520
Ramon: You know what I mean.

634
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong thing. So she don't see fear in her eyes now right

635
01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:50.130
Ramon: Yeah okay well that's a more comfortable.

636
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:51.510
Mm hmm. Okay.

637
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Mentally stronger now because you are

638
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: My client. It's not quite

639
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I still have some concerns.

640
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's what I've noticed about human beings, your motivation is a solid one right you are in love with this idea that you have an actual baby that's growing in this woman who you already are just adore right

641
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is just so exciting for you. And so the value and you can really see I will postpone my need maybe to make my point, I'll put that aside because I love this woman and I love that this baby is crawling inside her. Am I kind of getting it.

642
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.790
Ramon: Yeah, there's only one thing that me her kind of both as about

643
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.750
Ramon: What is that I got her to join this program, a while back.

644
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:58.860
Ramon: And she's been doing this program since like probably a month after me. She's been in this program and

645
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:04.530
Ramon: Not as she's pregnant. I don't want my baby born to a

646
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.250
Ramon: opiate. You know what I mean. And

647
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:19.290
Ramon: She like, Oh, well, I'm gonna go to sub a text or some, I said. Either way, it's the same thing. I don't want my baby born to it and

648
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.330
Ramon: And she

649
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:32.460
Ramon: Like doesn't want to stop. And that's pretty much doing. They were kind of bumpy heads about us only thing we're having troubles is because I don't want her doing anything.

650
01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.060
Ramon: Because I don't want my baby born Zenyatta shit.

651
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:52.080
Ramon: And and she's gonna be like, seven, eight weeks. So right now is the time to start quitting. You know what I mean, start mowing herself down from where she's at till now to nothing like

652
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:52.860
How far

653
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, how many yeah now like how far she

654
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.080
Ramon: She's at 16 okay

655
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And her argument back is

656
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.190
Ramon: That she doesn't want the baby to go through withdrawals.

657
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:27.600
Ramon: She thinks I'm kind of asking her to, like, just stop, but I didn't tell her I told her to taper down. I said just taper down to where you're taking one milligram bench like taper down, it's easy to taper down the Snark

658
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.590
Ramon: And

659
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's her physician who's the prescribing physician and Breitbart

660
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:34.200
Ramon: A real

661
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really, yeah.

662
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, she's pretty hardcore

663
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Tapering

664
01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:52.290
Ramon: Yeah, and I don't know what's really going on my girlfriend doesn't communicate with me about her part of the program for what I see.

665
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.960
Ramon: I know she is supposed to be tapering down but

666
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:06.690
Ramon: A real doesn't she still giving her trip she told her that they were the same thing as subjects.

667
01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:08.520
Ramon: And

668
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:15.360
Ramon: The doctor said when we went to go see the doctor for the baby, the other day. The doctor said they're not the same thing at all.

669
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:16.800
Ramon: And

670
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.730
Ramon: So I don't know what's going on. Why a real doesn't want to spur scriber so the text.

671
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.740
Ramon: And she's still giving her strips, but I just don't want her doing any of it.

672
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So subby text is the buprenorphine without the naloxone so you're not getting ready the opiate with your semi text idea so

673
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:53.880
Ramon: Exactly. That's what I'm trying to explain to her and I just want her to taper down and she just like

674
01:13:54.900 --> 01:14:04.290
Ramon: What if I relapse. I'm like, you're not. She's strong she's not she's doing really good she won't really left that's just her excuse because she's afraid to stop taking

675
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So if the fear.

676
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't happen over and I

677
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:13.620
Ramon: Understand, you know what I mean, I understand. Don't get me wrong but

678
01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:27.480
Ramon: For nine months she could do it. I know she could do it. And then when the baby's born, she can get back on Suboxone I don't mind but I just don't want my baby born to a short acting opiate

679
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: long acting. You guys are all

680
01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.200
Ramon: big bulky it

681
01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're on one now. Okay.

682
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

683
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it is a joint effort. This is not just hers. It's yours. And so getting more information. Sounds like would be useful. So maybe

684
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe meeting with Dr brielle maybe she could be with her on one on one scheduled appointment to talk. You know what I mean.

685
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.010
Ramon: And then that's her other things. She's been kinda

686
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:15.480
Ramon: Not into going to her appointments and stuff. She's been missing a lot or not making sure that she has good service, sir, and her excuses are ridiculous. You know what I mean. Oh, well I tried know the hell you didn't

687
01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.430
Ramon: You know what I mean.

688
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:25.890
Ramon: Yeah, of course I guess, cuz you like and I can't tell her that, because then she'll start tripping. So my car eBay. Well, when you get kicked off.

689
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:36.990
Ramon: I don't want to hear. No, I didn't, because I told you. That's why I'm telling you now to start tapering because you've been missing a lot of appointments and they're going to kick you out.

690
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:57.450
Ramon: So I don't. And she's like, Oh, she kind of she thinking about it, but she really doesn't want to. So I don't know what's going on with her and April at the moment because our point and she's been missing and group. She hasn't been staying for the full hour for

691
01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:58.650
Okay.

692
01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So this has to do really right now about this is a real stressor. This is a space, probably a feeling helpless.

693
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you cannot make another human being. Do something you can use extortion, you can you use power threat manipulation abuse, you could do those things. But it sounds like you've decided, those are off the table.

694
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:31.080
Ramon: Yeah, definitely. I want her to do it by choice. Like, I'm just throwing up in here. Hey, I don't want my baby's born book soaps, but

695
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: For just the

696
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.960
Ramon: Way, she saying it. She's kind of like not giving me a choice.

697
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So notice that this is the same person who's saying

698
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to relapse and is minimizing the risk

699
01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture that right this is someone who's minimizing the risk

700
01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Not let not not showing up to services. So hold on to that.

701
01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think she's ready to handle her life on life's terms. You think she's strong

702
01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they seem like the exact same thing, or do they seem like they are not the

703
01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:27.870
Ramon: Same. The only reason why she was saying the realest thing was when we went to the doctors, the doctor that was in there talking to her told her. Hey,

704
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:38.610
Ramon: I don't want you to stop taking cells because I don't want you to relax and then that was stuck in our head, the whole time. So that was her defense. The whole time, because that's what the doctor said

705
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:50.700
Ramon: But before the doctor said that she hasn't been thinking about relapse. She hasn't she hasn't even been like normally when we have that little urge will tell each other, baby. I want to go. Hi, baby.

706
01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:56.640
Ramon: You know what I mean, she hasn't even told me any of that because she hasn't been thinking about it. She's been good.

707
01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:00.240
Ramon: I can see it with my own eyes, you know,

708
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:03.420
Ramon: She's just she's just afraid to okay

709
01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going too fast going too fast she's on 16 milligrams, that is a part of why the craving isn't there. So what you're doing is projecting into the future.

710
01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That everything else that her self confidence or coping skills her ability to manage all the hormonal roller coaster. She's going to go through

711
01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That all of that should all these changes are going to happen. And she's not going to be thinking I could use she's on medication, you don't. You and I both don't know that. In fact, I don't even know that about you. I wouldn't, I haven't said that

712
01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: In real time.

713
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How you manage

714
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It on on a medicine so

715
01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you, I guess.

716
01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.400
Ramon: They both exist at the same time.

717
01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it would be nice to not have a fetus that has a substance in it that it's born dependent I'm we're in complete agreement on that. I'm with you.

718
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm on your side on that one.

719
01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And

720
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: She is chemically dependent on it right now.

721
01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard yet what she does to manage stress except completely unload and act kind of just unload on you. I haven't heard the healthy things that she is doing that make you think she can handle life on life's terms because it's about to get really difficult or with a baby, etc.

722
01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is she doing, what are you seeing it gives you evidence. This is a woman that really look at her. She's mature. She's communicates with herself and others.

723
01:19:47.280 --> 01:20:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've, I've seen her manage from bottom up emotional regulation skills. What are you actually seeing that gives you confidence that she can handle her life. Never mind that you want it to be true. I'm talking about what you witnessed

724
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.070
Ramon: Like from when we first got together.

725
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:11.400
Ramon: She went from like an everyday thing to now where she

726
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:13.110
Ramon: Doesn't

727
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:20.370
Ramon: Say anything. You know what I mean. She doesn't like she's not

728
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:32.940
Ramon: Oh, I'm so stressed out, I need this, or I'm so. She has her moments where she cries and stuff. But I think that's because of the hormones. You know what I mean, but

729
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:50.220
Ramon: I don't think she, I don't think she wants that methamphetamine, because that's what she was addicted. So she wasn't a day. It's opiates. She's addicted to methamphetamine, and I don't think she needs it.

730
01:20:52.230 --> 01:21:04.680
Ramon: I don't, I feel like she's really good, right, especially for seven and a half months. That's all she needs to do is not take Suboxone for seven and a half months she could get back on it. She'll be fine.

731
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:11.520
Ramon: But she's thinking I'm asking her quit forever, and she doesn't want to quit. I think she's ready

732
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:13.830
Okay.

733
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So when did her dependence on opiates start

734
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.440
Ramon: Like a month after me.

735
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You introduce her to

736
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:29.850
Ramon: Her the regular opiate

737
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:32.790
Ramon: Oh no, that started

738
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:41.550
Ramon: When she say when she was like 21 2021

739
01:21:51.660 --> 01:22:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a tricky bit, but it is her body. She does get to work with her physician. She does get to have some say about what she is ready to do and what she's not. This is the tricky part.

740
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.300
Right.

741
01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: If she says, I'm not ready.

742
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Nevermind that with a doctor said no one is saying stop.

743
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically what people were saying, and Brian hard anyway if they're saying it at all is taper taper get down to a safe medical dose. I don't know what physicians are saying that is, but it's three milligrams, or one, I guess it depends on who they're talking to, but

744
01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: If she thinks she's not ready. Are you worried that she'll sabotage her on recovery, just to prove around point

745
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:43.650
Ramon: Yes.

746
01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:56.340
Ramon: I guess I don't know, I feel like she's just using it for an excuse because the doctor says something that the doctor witnesses, she she witnesses shit about it.

747
01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.220
Ramon: Well wishes in her head. And now, because the doctor says

748
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Before she went in the doctor's office. What was she saying about her plans.

749
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:22.920
Ramon: A that she was going to take sub attacks and that she was going to switch over and this and that. But I didn't tell her at the time that I didn't want my baby born to it. I just let it go. For now, just so we can see what was going on. And then I finally told her last night.

750
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right they they both have opiates. No. So one of them just doesn't have the full agonist in it.

751
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got nothing to do with subjects. It's really

752
01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: how open are you to hearing her though hearing her concerns. If she says, I don't know what she's saying she says to you, I'm scared.

753
01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been pregnant, she's been pregnant before and I don't know what was going on. I don't know. She has new coping skills, but she's saying to you. I'm scared. And she can't list out evidence of ways that she's been managing her life in healthy ways I think we gotta listen to her.

754
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.490
Ramon: I guess I don't know I rather not have my baby.

755
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:51.150
Ramon: Or to sabotage it. I'm sorry, I don't want my baby born opiates if she's not ready. Then she could figure out a way to, I don't know, get rid of the baby. I just, I don't know. I don't want my baby born drugs. I don't, I don't give a shit what the excuses.

756
01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

757
01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.590
Ramon: Want a baby. My baby is going to be a fucking adding

758
01:24:56.490 --> 01:25:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I and I hear they adamant how adamant to the point that this timing of have starting a family.

759
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be in the discussion than this, then if you're not able

760
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To. So, look what's happening. We're actually changing the focus of the discussion to. I wonder if she's ready to have a baby. If he right. Isn't that what we're talking about.

761
01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can't for nine months, stop smoking. Right. You know, eating red dye and whatever else we're not supposed to be eating when we're when we're WHEN WE'RE PREGNANT can't. Is this the timing is this good timing to start a family, maybe that there's more. There's a big discussion to have

762
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:44.580
Ramon: Yeah, maybe I'll come and tell her that tonight actually something like that exactly like that.

763
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But Ramon, this is not a tell this is your opinion.

764
01:25:51.060 --> 01:26:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And as painful as it is, you and I, right. I don't have a right to change your opinion. You don't have a right to change mine. I don't have a right to change hers. She, she gets to decide what she thinks what she feels

765
01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: She took in some information from a Dr. Kim. What does she know who she is, what does she want

766
01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: She saying I'm not ready, we have to kind of listen if a person says, I'm not ready.

767
01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they ready to raise a baby. I don't know.

768
01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: She's scared if we can't talk about it openly and honestly and lovingly. Look, you're getting angry, I think.

769
01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But she's scared. We're not gonna, we're not going to be any good if we're mad at someone scary.

770
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a woman who is unsure of what to do about what she's about to face that says to me, the stuff you're talking about earlier. She's missing appointments. That's the problem.

771
01:26:52.200 --> 01:27:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: More of what's working if what's working is I'm getting more spiritual I'm spending time with healthy people. I'm eating better I'm sleeping. I'm addressing my physical

772
01:27:03.930 --> 01:27:06.930
Ramon: My exactly what she's doing. She's sleeping.

773
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.620
Ramon: That's what she's doing. She's just been sleeping.

774
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not mental health, that's a sign of depression. That's, that's a problem.

775
01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, unless it's I'm pregnant and I'm tired, that that's something a little different, but I'm

776
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Ramon

777
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tell you're scared. And of course, it shows up as anger, but I can tell how strongly. Put your hand on your life. And maybe we won't have this baby, but it is still her body.

778
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We still have to say it is physically still her body. She gets to say when she's ready to take her. She and her doctor, they get to work out what the plan is and my client, which is you I worry about you and you're feeling helpless about this. I'm concerned about you.

779
01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling helpless around this topic.

780
01:28:05.610 --> 01:28:06.450
Ramon: Kind of

781
01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:07.710
Ramon: I mean,

782
01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.350
Ramon: Yeah, kinda.

783
01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's where you start. See, that's about feelings and here we are back to this again, it's

784
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:24.990
Ramon: But I don't feel like going fuck all my life because of it. I just like, damn it sucks. Oh.

785
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll wait. Let's test that theory. Damn it sucks. She goes ahead continues to have the baby but stays on the buprenorphine.

786
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.810
Ramon: Then when I can do nothing about it.

787
01:28:37.410 --> 01:28:38.490
Ramon: Then there's acceptance.

788
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:39.750
Ramon: There's

789
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:42.540
Ramon: Then that's just the way is it is

790
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's not what I was seeing a few minutes ago. Okay, that's that shifted a little bit just now did something change in your mind.

791
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:58.410
Ramon: No, but if I can't change somebody or change with their, you know, then there's no reason to

792
01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.600
Ramon: I guess.

793
01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:05.100
Ramon: Keep voicing my opinion. I don't know.

794
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:08.220
Here.

795
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:10.560
Ramon: With me right now speaking

796
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, we share. We know you're in a family. You're at you're in a partnership. Here we share

797
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Our, our feelings. Right. You just told me the I feels are helping that communication is helping things are going, smoother. There's less arguing, some things are working, there's still a distance to go

798
01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say I'm keeping everything in. I'm letting her just go I I worry that it's going to get built up and that there will be an explosion.

799
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I get concerned. That's all I'm just checking in with you, making sure you have an outlet, you still have a right to speak just because she's pregnant, you still have a right to your feelings.

800
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

801
01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm what would it. I don't even know what it would be terrified. I'm imagining, you know, baby. I'm terrified addiction, has been a big part of my family history for generations. And to think

802
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.640
Ramon: They're believers.

803
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And her family. Babe, I'm terrified. I don't even have the word for how much fear that right now. You and I would be repeating another generation of chemical addiction dependence and I feel, I feel sick. I want to throw up. I just

804
01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that I can do it now. Right, that's talking, that's not saying you need to go do this, you need to go do that. That's I think she needs to know what's going on, how strongly you feel about it. Why not, it's important

805
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But she has her opinion, too.

806
01:30:47.760 --> 01:31:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's scared. We gotta kind of sort of be without and say, well then let's get you the skills, this bullshit. I'm not showing up for services that ain't gonna fly Bay right the medicine is the therapy.

807
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got, we've got to hear new things. We've got to do differently in order to feel better and improve our relationships with other people and with ourselves. She's not showing up for it. How is she changing. I don't know, maybe seeing someone else that's helping her. I don't know.

808
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a tricky one. Ramon

809
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is a very complex issue.

810
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to talk with her about what your, your big fears are

811
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:53.250
Ramon: Well, yeah, for sure. I guess now that you gave me a way of putting it. I could put it a better way than being really blunt about it, I guess.

812
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.790
Ramon: But I'll tell her how I feel. Instead of telling her what I think she should do.

813
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, very different NASA and the big change. I'm hoping has been instead of telling someone demanding that they go do something. Instead we're just sharing. We're just saying

814
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, babe. The reason why you're seeing this big reaction to me is because this, this drug stuff has been chasing me forever and the thought of land that on a little one with perfect innocence. Like, I can't, I can't wrap my head around it.

815
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd be crying. I mean, personally, it's almost making me cry now. Right. I mean, it's

816
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have a choice. We do.

817
01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we rob these these infants right of their choice. They didn't ask for that. And you could change the chemistry, maybe forever. Maybe not.

818
01:32:55.980 --> 01:33:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is where the doctor comes in that conversations needed. I'm not a physician, I'm just, I'm just talking about how important this conversation is and it sounds like it's really important. Now I'm making up a story about generations of whatever because I'm

819
01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm picturing some of the stories you've told me, and how important it is

820
01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you. So

821
01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I help like what else can I do

822
01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:26.670
Ramon: I don't know.

823
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:29.580
Ramon: Maybe talk to her doctor

824
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:35.040
Ramon: I don't know. Honestly, there's really not much you could do but

825
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You could talk to your doctor to

826
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:39.240
Ramon: When I be a

827
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:44.280
Ramon: Maybe I could just bring her and we to have two on ones mission.

828
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, absolutely.

829
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.310
Ramon: In fact, I almost Saturday or something. If you're, if you don't mind.

830
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

831
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:56.580
Ramon: So we heard the weekend, the week days of work. I can adjust, you know,

832
01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll, you'll get a hold of me. You tell me what's going to work. You already know I'm happy I meet with couples all the time.

833
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I teach them those skills and then you guys bring up the topics you want. And I just could you create that safe environment where people kind of stay in check. They don't go off the rails talking about storytelling and they sort of stay focus. I can create that environment.

834
01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, the answer is yes. You'll get to me and let me know when a good time would be

835
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the answer is yes.

836
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:25.950
Ramon: Okay, cool.

837
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an important one, and this one's a little it's got another layer to it because

838
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She's being seen by a provider here.

839
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I would want to confer with that provider and make sure because I had the same situation happened not obviously not you guys but I needed to touch base with the other therapists and say, Are you okay with this.

840
01:34:52.080 --> 01:35:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I even said if you want to do. Come join you go in there too. That's fine too. I don't have any ego attached to it. What I need to be respectful.

841
01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:04.680
Ramon: I don't honestly I don't even

842
01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:16.890
Ramon: Think she has a therapist at the moment. All she has is Dr. April. Because she's been missing our one on ones and then her therapist told her shoes. Gonna have to find somebody else or something because it wasn't working now.

843
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

844
01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what's, what's the name. What's your name,

845
01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.520
Ramon: Pauline or tease. Okay.

846
01:35:30.090 --> 01:35:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um,

847
01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You know i can i can see records there right in front of me.

848
01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not really my place to nose around. So if you decide to tell me who her therapist is I can touch base with that therapist and I can say, listen.

849
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is kind of where we're at. Clinically, I want to be very, very careful. So that everybody's treatment plan is being respected so

850
01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:04.710
Ramon: I honestly don't even know who are. I know it's the other female that you guys have

851
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Got we've got you.

852
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:07.080
And

853
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.360
Ramon: I can remember.

854
01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get back to me.

855
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:12.270
Ramon: All right.

856
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to me. And the answer is yes. I'm I love working with couples and families. Love it, love it a lot of good change can happen there.

857
01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice to have someone in there, making sure everybody's being respected and and feelings are shared without anyone feeling afraid or blamed, it's a it's a neat experience happy to do it. Just touch base with me.

858
01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.040
Ramon: Already okay

859
01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, let's just you and I set something up, but will realize that it may change if it turns out you want to have a couples intervention or something. But let's put something on the books because I do get scheduled pretty quickly for just at least you and I

860
01:36:57.150 --> 01:37:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Would noon march 25 be okay for you. It's another Wednesday would feel a lot like this except an hour earlier, an hour here. Yes.

861
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:08.520
Ramon: Yeah, that'll work for them.

862
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:10.260
Ramon: Now,

863
01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remote I'm really impressed with with how hard you're working this really and truly I'm not on

864
01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Your health level, but just this this courage to push forward with with tapering

865
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:29.880
Ramon: Let's keep let's keep doing it. That's another thing that I'm trying to get were heard like

866
01:37:30.570 --> 01:37:44.370
Ramon: Cuz that's why I was telling you guys to put me down at to the other day also is because I told her I was like, if you want, I'll quit, which you that we were doing it together. I'll quit smoking, chocolate, Eric think to show you that. I'll do it with you and

867
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:48.420
Ramon: So I don't know. I can try and everything I can.

868
01:37:49.470 --> 01:38:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's, let's, let's see. Let's slow down. Make her. She may already have the support that she needs. She might want to talk with that clinician, a little bit more in depth, now that there's this pregnancy in place.

869
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So you get back to me and tell me what you know. And let's see if we can put something together. Okay.
