Natalie Austin: Box Suboxone

10
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.920
Christopher Clay: And no, I'm not. I've been on it since approximately 2012

11
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:32.460
Christopher Clay: Just using going through different doctors like I had, you know, with Medicaid and then switch jobs and last insurance made too much money, so I didn't have Medicaid

12
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.580
Christopher Clay: Things like that.

13
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.020
Natalie Austin: Are you in Pennsylvania, Ohio.

14
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.550
Christopher Clay: I am in Ohio.

15
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.270
Ohio.

16
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.890
Christopher Clay: Where are you out of just curious.

17
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.990
Natalie Austin: I'm in Pennsylvania right by

18
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.210
Christopher Clay: Your clothes, Louis.

19
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.050
Yeah.

20
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.810
Natalie Austin: Are you working from home.

21
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:08.370
Christopher Clay: No, unfortunately not my factory shut down. We supply parts for General Motors. So we shut down and 17th of March.

22
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:21.210
Christopher Clay: My wife had the norovirus she got that, unlike the 14th. So my last day was the 15th, because I had to take it off. So I wouldn't spread it to everybody. And then the factory shut down. Two days later.

23
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.400
Christopher Clay: Cheese. So I

24
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.880
Christopher Clay: It's been boring. Since then, very boring.

25
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.580
Natalie Austin: What are you doing about bills.

26
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.590
Christopher Clay: Up my wife. She's an essential worker, which it's weird because she's an accountant, but she's an essential worker so

27
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:48.420
Christopher Clay: She gets paid I'm getting unemployment, but by filed for four weeks, and it's each paycheck still says pending so they're so backed up.

28
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.870
Christopher Clay: I know one positive thing I did get my 1200 dollar stimulus check on Friday so

29
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.700
Natalie Austin: I heard the highest getting them now.

30
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.350
Christopher Clay: Yeah, that helped out

31
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.000
Natalie Austin: Good, good.

32
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.830
Natalie Austin: That's awesome.

33
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.090
Natalie Austin: Okay, so one last time you saw a doctor for Suboxone

34
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.060
Christopher Clay: It was about my per script shin ran out.

35
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.980
Christopher Clay: Last Thursday. I think so. It was like the end of March. I could go get my bottle and check

36
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.430
Christopher Clay: I was supposed to. She gave me a one week's prescription and then I was supposed to go back up to Toledo.

37
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.930
Christopher Clay: But Toledo's kind of a hot spot right now for the virus. So I'm kind of not really going anywhere. And she didn't

38
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:50.880
Christopher Clay: She was really old. So she didn't know how to do any telemedicine and they wanted $140 each time just to go up there. Plus my prescription on top. They don't take Medicaid or anything. So we'll

39
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.120
Natalie Austin: See, yeah. A little pricey.

40
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:04.230
Christopher Clay: Yep. And then the previous doctor before that I saw Dr. Wayne koala. He is at a Cleveland and I saw him for 21 months straight

41
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:15.870
Christopher Clay: I stopped on to him in October, just because the price. He wanted $180 a month and then I had to pay for the prescription on top of it, it just ended up being a little too much.

42
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.630
Natalie Austin: I know I know Dr quality.

43
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.740
Christopher Clay: Do you really

44
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.930
Natalie Austin: Funny. Yeah, I used to work with him.

45
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.180
Natalie Austin: In Pennsylvania. We worked in a

46
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.290
Natalie Austin: Laser vein center together.

47
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.820
Christopher Clay: Over the years ago.

48
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.910
Natalie Austin: A funny. I know he lives in Ohio.

49
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.560
Christopher Clay: Yep. He's in somewhere in the area that is

50
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.700
Natalie Austin: Where is he now.

51
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
Christopher Clay: He's in the Cleveland area somewhere. He actually was a lot of clinic.

52
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.860
Christopher Clay: I might have to move rooms, because my dog bark.

53
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.620
Christopher Clay: Is a small traveling clinic that he goes to and Brian Ohio.

54
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.040
Christopher Clay: Essentially, you just show up. You give them 200 bucks. And he writes a prescription. He doesn't do any drug testing. You don't have to do

55
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.730
Christopher Clay: Any counseling, you might give them a piece of paper. And that's it, but

56
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.690
Natalie Austin: Oh, wow.

57
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.230
Christopher Clay: I mean, he's a nice guy. He just made me late for work twice, and I almost lost my job is he's messy.

58
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.820
Natalie Austin: That's not good.

59
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.000
Christopher Clay: That's why I stopped going there and too expensive.

60
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.890
Natalie Austin: Yeah, definitely.

61
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.840
Natalie Austin: So I'm the one done some of the places here in Pennsylvania. They charge 300 over $300

62
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.220
Natalie Austin: She's

63
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.990
Christopher Clay: It's crazy.

64
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.550
Natalie Austin: It is awful. Sounds like price gouging you know

65
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.440
Christopher Clay: It really is. And just being on Medicaid and getting approved for it. That helps out in the pricing so much. I mean, it's

66
00:05:47.400 --> 00:06:03.930
Christopher Clay: It's like some of the doctors figured out what you're going to pay on the street price per stuff and then they figure out, well, we can charge a little bit less if you come here. So if you want to go the legal way and pay 300 or the illegal a 400. It's kind of crazy.

67
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.430
Natalie Austin: It is, yeah.

68
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.320
Natalie Austin: That's why we deal with insurance. We don't only think we're cash pay

69
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.240
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

70
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.990
Natalie Austin: So your script. Are you in

71
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.800
Natalie Austin: Are you in with all right now.

72
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:29.760
Christopher Clay: I still my last strip that I had, I had one piece left. So I cut it in four pieces. And the last one I took was Saturday.

73
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.130
Christopher Clay: Okay, so I'm a little but I just woke up a little bit ago and I got my coffee, so

74
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.040
Natalie Austin: She take the beeper an orphan scripts eight slash to

75
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.780
Christopher Clay: Yes, that's correct.

76
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.220
Natalie Austin: Twice a day.

77
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:54.540
Christopher Clay: He had me on walking a half which was kind of a pain because they were given me the tablets and I had to cut the tablets at the time. And those were kind of a pain but

78
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:12.030
Christopher Clay: Either or it doesn't bother me. I, I don't like that's the one thing that I've honestly the one prescription medicine I've ever had that I don't like to take more of than it says on the bottle to for something with it. It just seems like if you take more. It doesn't work like it doesn't

79
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.540
Right.

80
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.170
Natalie Austin: She did one and a half twice a day.

81
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.110
Natalie Austin: Would you say one or day or

82
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.260
Christopher Clay: The one and a half twice a day.

83
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.370
Natalie Austin: Okay.

84
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.440
Christopher Clay: Or no, no, I'm confused.

85
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.910
Christopher Clay: It's not. Yeah, one and a half twice a day. It's not too.

86
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.830
Natalie Austin: I look in them. I want to check your

87
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.450
Natalie Austin: Prescriptions online.

88
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.280
Natalie Austin: After you had last

89
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.340
Christopher Clay: So I think the last time, in which she gave me a one week supply and it was like 13 of them.

90
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.290
Christopher Clay: My man.

91
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.960
Natalie Austin: Seven days.

92
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.280
Christopher Clay: Let me see. I've got my somewhere.

93
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.260
Natalie Austin: Was a one and a half a day.

94
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.700
Christopher Clay: Yes.

95
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.070
Natalie Austin: Oh, okay. Yes, that sounds right. Yeah.

96
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.270
Christopher Clay: Was

97
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.060
Christopher Clay: Place one and a half film under the tongue daily

98
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.770
Natalie Austin: Okay, perfect.

99
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:21.360
Christopher Clay: It was so confusing because this time I got the strips. Before I was getting a tablets, and I'd have to cut them and break them and they were such a pain to do

100
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.800
Natalie Austin: And they're shocked a small small to

101
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:38.100
Christopher Clay: Yes, they are in for a while. Dr. Call Academy doing three quarters of one. So going from two to one and three quarters. And that was kind of break up three quarters of on

102
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:38.880
That right

103
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.280
Natalie Austin: So that that does work for you. The one and a half what one and a half daily

104
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:56.970
Christopher Clay: It seems to I was on the two for such a long time and just for years and the doctor, one of the doctors. Before Dr quality.

105
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.770
Christopher Clay: Every time he would just say, do you want to stay in the same dose you on the lower

106
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:08.790
Christopher Clay: And it was a group setting and everybody would talk about it, you know, we'd always say, Oh, we're going to stay in the same dose, blah, blah, blah. But

107
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.750
Christopher Clay: Finally, it just got to the point I was just tired of you know I eventually want to stop taking and I don't want to take anything

108
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:26.940
Christopher Clay: So I just kind of cut myself down and Dr. K was like, hey, you can't build below one and a half a day without telling me or without me, you know, arranging it for you or something, I don't know.

109
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.780
Right.

110
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.350
Natalie Austin: Well, tell me about your story. What got you on to the opioids.

111
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.210
Natalie Austin: For. And how old are you,

112
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:59.640
Christopher Clay: It was about 2009 2010 head I broke my foot and three spots at work and got biking in percocet from the doctor and first time I ever took today via just a huge jolt of energy and you kind of feel like you're on top of the world. And then once you get that feeling you just kind

113
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:13.620
Christopher Clay: Of never want to stop went from that to buy and everything I could off the street to get in like the oxy Cotton's and they'll pain is from friends. And then finally,

114
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:21.990
Christopher Clay: Saw the Suboxone on the street back in was probably like 2012, I think it was one of my cousin started taking it.

115
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:33.120
Christopher Clay: And kind of sounds dumb. It was a lot cheaper than the other stuff, but it actually seemed to work better and you will feel bad. The next day, you wouldn't be in withdraw.

116
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:45.540
Christopher Clay: That was probably the worst thing for me with the withdrawal just day two or day three with you this cold sweats, your body just feels pains everywhere.

117
00:10:47.580 --> 00:11:00.150
Christopher Clay: That's probably one of my worst things probably the withdrawal part. That's what I was always worried about side always try and stay ahead of the game either make contrivance box and tablets or vitamins or Percocet, or something.

118
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:19.110
Christopher Clay: But it just got to the point where you see all your money disappear, and you see working 6070 hours a week, and you're driving a beat up car that you don't have gas to put in it. You know, it just got to the point along time ago. Whereas, okay, I need to do something something different.

119
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.680
Natalie Austin: Well, good for you. I'm glad you're

120
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.290
Natalie Austin: You're getting healthier. You're on the right track.

121
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.760
Christopher Clay: Thank you.

122
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.810
Christopher Clay: And it's

123
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:47.070
Christopher Clay: My situation, it's kind of him might not be any more. But when I go to explain it to doctors. It's usually the opposite. They don't have somebody that's already on Suboxone or by and that off of the street.

124
00:11:47.640 --> 00:12:01.470
Christopher Clay: So usually when I explain it to the doctors. A lot of times they look at me kinda weird like, Oh, well, I mean, I guess that's a different situation. You know, usually get to go in with the dirty drug screen to get Suboxone that have it in your system to get it. That makes sense.

125
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.720
Natalie Austin: Maybe for your first visit. Yeah. But since you're a transfer, you know,

126
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.520
Natalie Austin: It's okay.

127
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.460
Christopher Clay: But yeah, that's about it. Just, just trying to better

128
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.550
Natalie Austin: Um,

129
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.660
Natalie Austin: past medical history.

130
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:36.690
Christopher Clay: Nothing really. I've had a kidney stone, years and years ago maybe like 2009 or so that's really a

131
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.520
Christopher Clay: Year ago I really don't go see the doctor unless

132
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.380
Christopher Clay: Like, come on, say, the flu or something urgent something major

133
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.310
Natalie Austin: Pass surgeries.

134
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:58.200
Christopher Clay: A just the kidney stone removal. If that's even a surgery they went in with the basket and took it out.

135
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.440
Natalie Austin: Any allergies to anything.

136
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:12.120
Christopher Clay: Just your seasonal like the spring allergies mowing, hey, stuff like that, you

137
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.100
Christopher Clay: Have only

138
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:29.880
Christopher Clay: Tylenol. I don't take that it seems like anytime I take it, it makes like my back and body just hurt really really bad. So one of my doc, my family doctor from years ago said, I might be allergic to Tylenol possibly

139
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.720
Christopher Clay: Okay, so I just take ibuprofen for headaches.

140
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.870
Natalie Austin: Um, family history or your parents still alive.

141
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.370
Christopher Clay: Yes, they are.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.810
