5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.990
Donna Jochimsen: I know

6
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:15.900
Donna Jochimsen: I know

7
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how was your week

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:34.500
Donna Jochimsen: It was pretty good. My kids unexpectedly, all of them came down last week. Everybody was off work because of the coronavirus and the kids are out of school. So they came down and spent almost the whole week here.

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.460
Donna Jochimsen: Till Friday and then they got PANIC, DON'T Friday that they wouldn't be able to buy groceries. So they went home and

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.440
Donna Jochimsen: Go shopping

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.760
Oh, wow.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And did your dad, state your brothers.

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.570
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, my dad stayed at his brothers. Everybody stayed away from my dad that nobody wants to get him sick. For one thing, but he is

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.330
Donna Jochimsen: He's got a cold or something.

15
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.690
Donna Jochimsen: Again, I'm sure it's not coronavirus I don't know where he would have came in contact with it so

16
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610
Donna Jochimsen: Right, I'm sure it's just old but at his age. It's concerning anyway.

17
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.660
Yeah.

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. Um, have you seen a doctor.

19
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.480
Donna Jochimsen: He has not seen a doctor, yet he just started getting sick.

20
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.560
Donna Jochimsen: Not last night, but the night before that and

21
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.420
Donna Jochimsen: My brother had said that he was going to take him and I think I'm going to end up having to do it anyway. So

22
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.860
Donna Jochimsen: Probably. I think we're getting him and today was as quick as we can get him in. Is it Tuesday yes today.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.360
Donna Jochimsen: So,

24
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good.

25
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And everything's going good over there. So you still got

26
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:59.640
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, he's he's doing really, really well. I'm so glad that we finally got him over there. He was just being so stubborn about it. About not going and

27
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:13.290
Donna Jochimsen: I was a little worried because he was not happy being there. So I was concerned about that, but this time. He's doing really good he almost forgets that he has had another house, a while back.

28
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.880
Donna Jochimsen: You know, just everything's normal for him now. So he doesn't think that far back, and it's working out well.

29
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.870
Good.

30
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. Yeah.

31
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.740
Donna Jochimsen: It is that's been a big relief off of me. It really has

32
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so besides spending time with your kids. What else have you been doing

33
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.510
Donna Jochimsen: Um,

34
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.550
Donna Jochimsen: Well, let's see. I did some painting in the house I done some work in my mind. Get out of your mind and in your life, but

35
00:02:48.660 --> 00:03:01.050
Donna Jochimsen: It's a little odd. It's. I'm not sure I totally understand it yet. Excuse me. I don't think I'm supposed to understand it quite yet, but the first chapter is

36
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:21.240
Donna Jochimsen: Some about suffering human suffering and and what are you suffering from, you know, and so it's been a little bit. It's been interesting. They have you listed. How long has it been affecting you. Most, most of the things that that bother me. I've been there, most of my life.

37
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.390
Donna Jochimsen: That they have you go through and find which ones are actually connected to each other and it

38
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.610
Donna Jochimsen: Turns out pretty much all of them.

39
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:42.930
Donna Jochimsen: So, you know, maybe I can get down. I don't know. I'm trying to understand the concept. I get that. The concept is and they gave an analogy of you're in a constant war.

40
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:54.270
Donna Jochimsen: With anything this in this case yourself and you have to keep fighting and fighting and fighting. But what if you just didn't know what if you found a way to just step out of it.

41
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:09.360
Donna Jochimsen: So that's that just sounds really interesting to me. I really the way that I feel I know I've mentioned it before stuck it. It makes me feel like that might be a good way to get stuck.

42
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.260
Right.

43
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just might

44
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As well. It might be

45
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:24.000
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I mean, I don't know, but I have nothing to lose and and I've already gained some insight. So it's definitely going to be worth it.

46
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.870
Yeah.

47
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really, that's huge.

48
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into what is second. What's the second chapter about

49
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.850
Donna Jochimsen: The power of human language.

50
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.170
Donna Jochimsen: And how words how words affect us just even words that we think about ourselves, you know, and how how

51
00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:02.190
Donna Jochimsen: You can actually become that you think you're depressed, you use the word depressed about yourself all the time, you'll probably be depressed, you know, just things just things like that. I just, I haven't read too much of the second chapter. My kids interrupted my work, but

52
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.800
Donna Jochimsen: I'm, I'm looking, I'm really curious and looking forward to going through it.

53
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: does sound like a really good book. What's the name of it again. I'm sorry.

54
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.290
Donna Jochimsen: Get out of your get out of your mind and into your life.

55
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.330
Donna Jochimsen: The new that it's the act concept.

56
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's

57
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.620
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, I know. I know that.

58
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:38.280
Donna Jochimsen: My there's mindfulness and this and I'm still practicing mindfulness. So that's been. It's not easy for me to be mindful.

59
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not

60
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:56.850
Donna Jochimsen: I've never really done it before. And it's, I have to work at it a little bit. My best way feels like when I'm out walking. I can usually stay focused on my surroundings and, you know,

61
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.260
Donna Jochimsen: So an everyday life. It's something I would definitely have to, to think about a lot more than I have.

62
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. You can do it like you can start training your brain by doing it when you're walking, but also doing it when you're like doing dishes are doing laundry or

63
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean when you're just doing the household tasks.

64
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.120
Donna Jochimsen: I do

65
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:34.830
Donna Jochimsen: I've noticed when I'm doing that, that usually my mind falls into the normal loop of thinking of the past or, you know, just things that really doesn't aren't helpful to me right now.

66
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.790
Donna Jochimsen: Right, gotta, like, make your mind go out of it.

67
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.160
Donna Jochimsen: I do I have to force my mind I but it's so used to doing that, that it's very automatic for me now.

68
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's how most people

69
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

70
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:59.790
Donna Jochimsen: Sure, it probably is. Because you know unless you've thought about that. You don't you just do the same thing over and over again.

71
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.630
Yeah.

72
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, it's making a conscious choice to get out of that negative headspace

73
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not always easy when it's not.

74
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:20.700
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, it's not easy, but, you know, thinking about the past repetitively isn't helpful, even if it's not negative. That's the past and

75
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:35.130
Donna Jochimsen: You can acknowledge it, but to keep your keep your head there. I do that sometimes about my husband, I'll think about that a lot. But it usually ends up making me feel sad and I don't want to feel that

76
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.600
Donna Jochimsen: He would want that there's no point in that, you know,

77
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.530
Yeah.

78
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long ago did you did your husband passed.

79
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.440
Donna Jochimsen: Away. It was two years in February.

80
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you have to remember that.

81
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you're still in that grieving process.

82
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

83
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:02.070
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I am. Yeah, it got it got slowed down a little bit too because

84
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:16.230
Donna Jochimsen: At first, I was just in such shock. I mean, I don't know why, but I was in shock. I knew it was coming, but when I actually happened. It was quite a time of beings like in shock and not thinking about anything, one way or the other, and

85
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:30.000
Donna Jochimsen: Then I I did the old start taking care of everybody else, man. You know, and I I pushed it back even farther. So, I still have some grieving to do. Yeah.

86
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's important when it comes up that you just feel it.

87
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean and walk through it. You don't want to sit in it.

88
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, for too long but you definitely want it to come out, you know,

89
00:08:43.680 --> 00:09:00.240
Donna Jochimsen: Right, right. It does. It comes up at odd times when you know not expecting at something will remind you, and you know, I definitely am grieving is just, it's I kind of put the process off a little bit by avoiding a

90
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

91
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I do. I mean, I think that that's fine because I needed to do that. I, I was on my own. For the first time in my life I had

92
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:19.920
Donna Jochimsen: To get things situated. My kids were having a really hard time so I felt I needed to push it back a little bit, but it but it's there.

93
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.930
Donna Jochimsen: It'll just probably take me a little longer to do it. That would have normally

94
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.800
Yeah.

95
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Excuse me.

96
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm congested um

97
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

98
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I haven't been anybody

99
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

100
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.400
Donna Jochimsen: I get it. I know, but every I think for the next six months, people are going to be going oh

101
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What is that

102
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.040
What I feel that way. Right.

103
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.570
Donna Jochimsen: I'm not really worried about it myself. And I'm more concerned about

104
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.410
Donna Jochimsen: You know, like my dad, giving it to my dad or something like that.

105
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.190
Yeah.

106
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, that would be a concern to you know what I mean.

107
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But we, you know, again, we talked. I think I talked about it all day yesterday because people are just in this huge panic and it brings anxiety up, you know, which, you know, if you struggle with anxiety. Anyways, that's all you need is something like this to you know

108
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stay in a panic state.

109
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And people are angry. You know, people are angry. They don't understand. You know why this is happening, why they can't buy, you know, but wipes and toilet paper and you know

110
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.220
Donna Jochimsen: I understand that part myself I

111
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.710
Donna Jochimsen: If I, if I was to go stock up on things. I don't think it would just, it would be toilet paper.

112
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.810
Donna Jochimsen: I'd want food.

113
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right canned foods and

114
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, stuff like that. Yeah, it's like the basic necessities of the first thing that ran out. It's kind of insane yeah hoarders. You know a lot of people took more than

115
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

116
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:08.880
Donna Jochimsen: Absolutely are still our local Walmart has that now put a limit on what how many of those things people can buy

117
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.700
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, because if you're hoarding so badly.

118
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing actually

119
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

120
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very different.

121
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah, I don't get

122
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:36.870
Donna Jochimsen: I don't get my I don't get my my meeting or my a meeting that I usually go to they stop that for a while. It's at the hospital and they've been asked to not do it and I

123
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:43.680
Donna Jochimsen: Thought about doing it somewhere else and just decided that it was a large enough group that we just postpone it for a while.

124
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you still doing your online.

125
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.490
Donna Jochimsen: I am still doing my online.

126
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And is that gotten revved up a little bit because of all this. So people go online.

127
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.650
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I think so. I haven't been doing it long enough to really

128
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:11.430
Donna Jochimsen: No, no, not familiar with all the people that you know that do show up there has been a lot of people there, though there has now that you mentioned it.

129
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. Finding out, you know, alternative avenues to be able to keep that connection going is important.

130
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

131
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:38.610
Donna Jochimsen: It. Well, it's really good for me, too, because I live in this really small area. And so there's not there's a and NA. And that's, that's it. You know, there are no smart recovery groups or things like that. I have looked already to make sure

132
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but

133
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.720
Donna Jochimsen: So I like getting a little variety and being online.

134
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. Good. I'm glad. And how have you been feeling any cravings any issues coming up.

Donna Jochimsen: You know not. No, I haven't.

136
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.490
Donna Jochimsen: Um,

137
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:09.900
Donna Jochimsen: No, I have not had any cravings, I have not. I don't, I don't even recall thinking, Oh, I wish I could use or, you know,

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing, you know,

140
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're just you're living life and you're doing it, you're doing it, you're trying new things and you're putting positive in your brain, you know,

141
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're actually doing that internal work how that that type of stuff just kind of quiet. You know what I mean. You don't even realize it. That's what's

142
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Going on. Yeah.

143
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hang on a second. I got it.

144
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.000
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, I couldn't hear you there for a minute. I turned it back up.

145
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.250
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, okay. Can you hear me.

146
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.450
Yeah, there you are.

147
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.670
Donna Jochimsen: All of a sudden, I couldn't hear you. So I had to turn mine off and then back on.

148
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:54.810
Oh,

149
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're just gonna, you're going to keep working out of that book.

150
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.470
Right. Yes.

151
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.870
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, I'm going to do the language or the words one this week.

152
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:14.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're going to continue going to your online meeting and stay connected

153
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.620
Donna Jochimsen: Yes.

154
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.120
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, I am. And most certainly

155
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you get food. How has yourself Caribbean

156
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.340
Donna Jochimsen: It's been a while. It's been pretty good I

157
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:37.650
Donna Jochimsen: I I quit eating sugary things so that that's good. I don't know what I really don't know what happened. It's

158
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:50.610
Donna Jochimsen: When I quit smoking. It was almost like somebody flipped a switch. I bought in some hard candies, you know, and I was eating those all the time, but it was almost like it turn on a switch thing you want more sugar.

159
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:59.670
Donna Jochimsen: I was wanting to eat every sweet thing I could find it was almost I was almost a little scared by it. It was so intense, but

160
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:07.650
Donna Jochimsen: Like all things once I just made myself not do it for a couple of days that intensity went away.

161
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.830
Donna Jochimsen: And I've been able to step back from that.

162
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it takes like it's my understanding, it takes like three days.

163
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before those cravings, you know, start

164
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:41.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Decreasing and going away, but it's it's funny to me because, you know, this is the the subtle, subtle, subtle Miss of addiction, because it will veer you into some other direction. Like you hear people that are just, you know, continue are working, you know, insane amount of hours.

165
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, right. And what are you doing for your recovery. Well, I'm working well.

166
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, what are you doing for your recovery.

167
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

168
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.900
Donna Jochimsen: That's where right

169
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, that's, you know, that's just switching one addiction to the other, or going to

170
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The gym obsessively. You know what I mean, that's what still switching

171
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:12.390
Donna Jochimsen: Our minds. Just want to hold on to something that that we can do that will make you feel better.

172
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:19.950
Donna Jochimsen: You know, and you've been if you take away one your mind thinks of something else you could probably do.

173
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.810
Donna Jochimsen: That might make you feel better. While and yeah

174
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I mean,

175
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:43.980
Donna Jochimsen: I'm going through. I'm living through all those things and I'm just trying to get to a place like I said with with mindfulness with my workbook trying to get into a place where that that is my self care right now.

176
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure. That's definitely really good self care and you're drinking. I know you've been sick, but you're trying to today's the first day with no

Donna Jochimsen: It is, and I'm doing I'm eating and drinking fine I somewhat of fact, I had soup last night, and I've been able to drink water or

180
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.950

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:42.210
Donna Jochimsen: I'll be around someone who's sick with somebody something different. It's not a semi thing is is congestion and coughing and

185
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.100

Donna Jochimsen: There's not many places to go and

192
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:27.960
Donna Jochimsen: I don't know. I think I'm just gonna I'll take dad to the to the doctor today and I my plan for the rest of the week is basically just to kind of hunker down and I've got my mother in law day on Thursday.

Donna Jochimsen: Once a month. She comes and gets me and we go do something together.

194
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:48.540
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I don't know. We drive each other crazy over the years about we both loved your sign a lot and it makes her feel better to to be in contact with me.

195
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure. No.

196
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.630
Donna Jochimsen: You're somebody that once a month.

197

Donna Jochimsen: Once a month. I call it mother in law day

198
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's really cool that you do that.

199
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What kind of easy guys do.

200
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:16.020
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, well, we've went to the beauty shop. We went out to lines. I'm not sure. Well, we're going to do on Thursday, since how they want you to stay in and not do to match, but we'll, we'll do something she might maybe she'll make lunch for me or something.

201
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Awesome. And you guys have a good conversation.

202
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:35.850
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, we do have a good conversation. There's been times and in our 45 years of knowing each other that we kind of class a little bit. But, you know, like I said, we both loved her love her son a lot and we find common ground in that

203
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good. What is it, what

204
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Does that bring up any of your grief when you're with her.

205
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:53.250
Donna Jochimsen: Know some Well depending on if I go to her house or not. She is the kind of person that

206
00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:04.770
Donna Jochimsen: Like on the anniversary of all the first birthday that my husband had passed my kids all came to, you know, to gather around us knowing it would be hard and

207
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:18.240
Donna Jochimsen: We went to her house and she had like 20 picture albums out all over the house of pictures every age mark from growing all his growing up years and it was overwhelming to me.

208
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:29.520
Donna Jochimsen: And she still has a lot of pictures and moment as out and it's still, it's still a little overwhelming to me but and that does bring up some grief.

209
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay well get, you know, be mindful about it, you know, this week. But if it starts bringing it up. Feel it.

210
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.440
Donna Jochimsen: Walk through it.

211
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, just don't sit in it too long, go from, you know, when your mind starts going from the tragedy of the loss.

212
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To the good memories and holding on to the good memories. When you can get to that point where you know that's what you think about, you know what I mean.

213
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then you know that. Yeah. Mostly. Mostly. Mostly I do it, that is mostly

214
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.930
Donna Jochimsen: But there are still there's times when I get a little stuck in the sadness about oh

215
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. You know, that's, I don't think that we ever really

216
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get over losing somebody I think that we learn to live without them.

217
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I would agree with that.

218
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That hurt of the losses always there. But again, you know, when you get to a point where you can focus on

219
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The good memories, more than the bad you know

220
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That definitely

221
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I definitely

222
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.550
Donna Jochimsen: I definitely do. I had to do that while he was still alive, he

223
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.520
Donna Jochimsen: Had he had cancer of the liver and

224
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:56.700
Donna Jochimsen: I knew that he was gonna die long time before he did so I had quite a lot of time. I agree. A lot before he died, actually, probably more before he died. Then after

225
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.540
Yeah.

226
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.330
Donna Jochimsen: Most of the sadness and and loss came, even before he was gone.

227
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. And then here comes the shock when it happens, you know,

228
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:22.260
Donna Jochimsen: It was I wasn't shocked but I'm anyway, which is odd because like I said, I knew for at least a year ahead of time that he was not going to make it. And, but it was still the whole thing was a shock wouldn't happen.

229
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.700
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. Not a surprise shock, just a shock to your system.

230
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:34.230
Donna Jochimsen: Like your life is changing. Today was the day that you've been knowing is coming. It's here. So,

231
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, there's still that piece of unbelievable where you just can't grass, your, your mind around

232
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Around it, you know.

233
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:52.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then once you get through that piece. I mean, again, it's, it's all a process of of that new learning

234
00:22:53.160 --> 00:23:04.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, really, is whether it is just like a living without drugs and alcohol. It's no different. It's like learning a whole different way of living without something in your life you know it.

235
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.800
Donna Jochimsen: That is true. It is. It is.

236
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:09.630
Yep.

237
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so we're working on the book. This week I'm curious to hear about Chapter two, I'm going to look up the book.

238
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:16.170
Myself.

239
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.130
Donna Jochimsen: I I read a little bit of it. And I'd not enough to really grasp it. So I'll talk about it next week.

240
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:35.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Perfect no perfect. Just make sure that you know during this week that you don't find yourself stuck in your head, you know, in the negative headspace be mindful of where your head is, you know, during the day.

241
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:47.820
Donna Jochimsen: You know, this has helped me with that it's made me more aware that I'm in that space and don't need to be there anymore, you know. Mindfulness and Self me that much anyway.

242
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:57.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely when you're in a mindful state, you're also at the same time. What's going on underneath is this whole emotion regulation.

243
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Scenario that's happening underneath that mindfulness, right, because your mind is connected to your emotions. So if you're if you're pulling yourself out of that sadness. You're then also altering that emotional state.

244
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:22.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it, and you're doing actually two things at once when you're doing it you know you're changing that that emotional process. But yet, you're also changing that mindset and so

245
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of an email. I didn't, I

246
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:33.630
Donna Jochimsen: Honestly, did not know before that I could even do that, really, I didn't even think about stopping you know getting myself out of that. I just sort of went with it and

247
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:44.100
Donna Jochimsen: It's been, it's been really helpful to know to say, Wait, I don't want to do that right now and and and go a different way. Yeah.

248
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We, I think we, you know, as humans don't realize how much control. We actually have, you know, internally, you know, my thoughts become things I do this.

249
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get this daily affirmation from the universe is what it's called. And it's to UT ted.com is what it's called. So every day I get this morning affirmation about

250
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:25.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How powerful, you know, our mind is and how thoughts become things and what we think we become and you know what I mean. And the more that I feed my brain that the more I realized that I'm in total control over what's going on over here, you know,

251
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I get to think the thoughts that I need to think or not thinking the thoughts. I need to think I get to feel the thoughts.

252
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:41.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or feel the feelings are not feeling feelings, whichever it is. And when you get that to that point. And I'm still in in a learning curve. You know, I still

253
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go back and forth and back and forth, but I'm able to pull myself out of it a lot faster than I ever did. And it's kind of amazing. You know when you get to that point.

254
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:58.380
Donna Jochimsen: Where you can do that. I said I really wasn't aware that I could do that. I didn't ever think about it before so

255
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.390
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I can just go, oh, I don't want to think that anymore and

256
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.480
Donna Jochimsen: Like change the channel a little bit so

257
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:12.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, like teams and channel that's exactly it. I need to get off of this one and get get on over here.

258
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.140
Right.

259
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To the live channel you

260
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.190
Donna Jochimsen: Definitely, yeah.

261
00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how do you think

262
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything is going with your recovery.

263
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.800
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I think it's going really well. I have to find another sponsor.

264
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.850
Donna Jochimsen: My sponsor is retiring violently.

265
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.480
Donna Jochimsen: So that will be different.

266
00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:54.780
Donna Jochimsen: I I'm gonna miss my my noon at the hospital meetings, but maybe I'll look and see if there's some another one that is going to continue. Part of the reason that they didn't as where they were having it.

267
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:07.500
Donna Jochimsen: They didn't want to be in the hospital sick people. Yeah, you know. So I think I will. I think I'll look around, because I it's I live by myself.

268
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:20.850
Donna Jochimsen: My kids are all little bit at a distance. So it's easy for me to just sort of get stuck with what you know in my house, what with what I'm doing. I'm not completely uncomfortable with that but it's

269
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.360
Donna Jochimsen: Essential for me to be out and around people.

270
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.260
Yeah.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.540

272
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're going to look and try to find alternatives to your meeting, you're going to work out.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.030
Donna Jochimsen: And other local one. Yeah.
