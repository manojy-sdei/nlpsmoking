00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.190
Magalie Marcellus: What kind of jobs are you doing

38
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.930
N817: I was a cook at a restaurant across the street from me so

39
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.630
N817: It only took me like three minutes to walk there.

40
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.520
Magalie Marcellus: Happen.

41
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.200
N817: Um, I've got into a fight with the boss, because

42
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.180
N817: I see decided that

43
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:15.990
N817: It was no longer gonna pay me every Thursday. Now it's going to be every other Thursday.

44
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:26.730
N817: Payday on Thursday I want my money and he was the only change that now we have now you don't get paid every two

45
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.380
N817: Well, you can't do that to me without warning him and

46
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:40.740
N817: He got he jumped up and got on my face and thought I was gonna like back down or wrong or something.

47
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.940
Magalie Marcellus: But physical

48
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.070
N817: Is just an argument, nothing.

49
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.140
Magalie Marcellus: I can never fall

50
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.520
So,

51
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.360
N817: That was the end of that show.

52
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.090
Magalie Marcellus: Away, they're

53
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.120
N817: A little over a year.

54
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.300
Magalie Marcellus: So do you. Thank you. Hello, I'm

55
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.150
Magalie Marcellus: At least approach in a different way. So you wouldn't lose the job altogether.

56
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:20.310
N817: Yeah, I probably could have. I was just because you know he know he knew I live week by week I barely

57
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.900
N817: Know, I only made I was only making like $125 a week. So, you know,

58
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.890
N817: I just lost over

59
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:40.050
N817: Cuz I was close to the payday. I need my money and he decided that it was time to

60
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.760
N817: Go to every other only pay

61
00:22:46.680 --> 00:23:00.030
Magalie Marcellus: What definitely he should have won the employees it so be prepared. But again, you know, sometimes people make decision and you don't have control over. So then you have to control how you respond to it.

62
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:15.450
Magalie Marcellus: That's the other piece because you know when I agree with everything that comes up, but he has to be able to respond in a way that is effective. And also, that's not gonna lead you to lose your job.

63
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:27.630
Magalie Marcellus: Because you know what good does he do with losing a job and even though. Yes. You didn't get paid right away. But if the approach was definitely could still be able to work their

64
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.260
N817: need and want to work in are working

65
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.620
There.

66
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.410
N817: We need to do all the

67
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.110
N817: grunt work.

68
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.970
N817: And then we're hiring new

69
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.610
N817: People that know nothing.

70
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:45.900
Magalie Marcellus: And

71
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.810
N817: Start doing more money and give them more hours.

72
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.820
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, okay, what

73
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.470
N817: Time's right for

74
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.940
N817: Me, they would cut my hours down more and

75
00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.870
Magalie Marcellus: More. I see.

76
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.000
Magalie Marcellus: So you are getting to the point

77
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.940
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah so. So you were having some issues with them prior to

78
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.690
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, without payment. The payables though.

79
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:15.390
N817: Yeah, how do you expect someone to live off for 12 hours a week on minimum wage.

80
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.160
Magalie Marcellus: Right.

81
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.340
N817: Our

82
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.630
Magalie Marcellus: Yet started with 33 hours.

83
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.420
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, oh wow that's a big

84
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:32.340
N817: River. I was working between 30 to 40

85
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:39.660
N817: And appeared a couple months they hired new people well

86
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.390
N817: It wasn't even the people's family members.

87
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.350
N817: So they were hiring their family members and then cut my hours more and more and more.

88
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.860
Magalie Marcellus: And

89
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.570
Magalie Marcellus: When you training, those people are the new family member that come along.

90
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.410
N817: Yeah, I would have to train to

91
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.150
Magalie Marcellus: Be challenging

92
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.620
N817: Yeah, I felt like it was just being used in the

93
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.070
N817: Payment thing was the straw that broke the camel's back

94
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.230
Magalie Marcellus: Was that last the last straw for you.

95
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.610

Person.

N817: You pushed me and pushed me and pushed me

100
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.450
N817: The other side comes out.

101
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.830
Magalie Marcellus: Everybody has their limits.

102
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.940
Yeah.

103
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:47.280
N817: Man.

104
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:54.000
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh. And, but the but you say then get to any physical competition. He

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.600
N817: Just knows screaming at each other.

106
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.690
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. And after that. You just walked away or did you leave the premises.

107
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.310
I told

108
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:18.090
N817: After that, after the way Jesus came and pulled me away from home. I told him I said to steal my money, I'm leaving her and I'm never coming back here to serve you better go back

110
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.320
Magalie Marcellus: So,

111
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:41.400
N817: He paid me and I told him, I said, I'm never coming back for here. I said, Don't ever call me.

112
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:42.780
Magalie Marcellus: For the

113
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.290
Rest.

114
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.120
N817: If you jump off our chair and come right in that me

115
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.200
N817: asked me if I want to go. If I want to go, you know,

116
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.250
N817: I don't need that.

117
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.300
N817: I kind of wish.

118
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.040
N817: Me, you know,

119
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.210
Magalie Marcellus: Why

120
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.720
N817: Because he's the owner who's the owner of the restaurant.

121
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.160
N817: On camera. Yeah, I didn't make no hostile move towards him because

122
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.910
He jumped up

123
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.400
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

124
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.050
N817: So it would have been so

125
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.710
N817: crazy guy has over 100 pounds.

126
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.000
Magalie Marcellus: If you can avoid confrontation. The goal is. So why did

127
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.740
N817: You bring it to

128
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.880
N817: Put violence upon me without the

129
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:50.460
Magalie Marcellus: Why, of course you know you have a right to defend yourself. But as long that you know you're not initiating any kind of

130
00:27:51.630 --> 00:28:01.320
Magalie Marcellus: Violence and also if you can defuse the situation before I get to the point of being violent always that's always the best you know approach.

131
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.410
Magalie Marcellus: Wants to get to the point where everybody's getting aggressive, then who knows what else can happen.

132
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:18.870
Magalie Marcellus: And that's why sometimes people, you know, it can even become deadly and we don't want to be in a situation where, you know, they really get people. Can we get all hurt even

133
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:26.760
Magalie Marcellus: See, so this kind of thing you know is best to kind of what it all together. If you can

134
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.540
Magalie Marcellus: But I'm glad that you know

135
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:45.030
Magalie Marcellus: It didn't get to a point where anybody you get physical with law enforcement has to be in law because there was some kind of assault taking place and things of that nature.

136
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.500
Yeah.

137
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:56.850
Magalie Marcellus: Now, um, I know you mentioned with the sleep. What else, um, are you having difficulty with any anxiety issue.

138
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.580
N817: Yeah, I've always had an aside,

139
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.480
N817: For the last 10 years at least maybe longer

140
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.850
Magalie Marcellus: I on any meds for that.

141
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.610
N817: The only thing right now the only man I'm getting

142
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.540
N817: A little bit of Raza pain from Doc, Dr. James

143
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.530
Magalie Marcellus: Jemison

144
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.670
N817: As I showed her the Bible's for my psychiatry.

145
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.920
N817: Yeah, I was there.

146
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:38.040
N817: For years, and I showed her. I said, look, this is why you take provide anxiety. I don't have

147
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:39.450
N817: To

148
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:45.630
N817: Go. She gave me like a real low dose, like a quarter or whatever was okay.

149
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.400
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

150
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.050
Magalie Marcellus: So you say, eventually, you want to go back to your primary doctor

151
00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.750
N817: Yeah, cuz I gotta go. I gotta start with primary doctor
