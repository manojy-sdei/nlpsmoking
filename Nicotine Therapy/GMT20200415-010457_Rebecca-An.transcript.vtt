Sandra's iPhone: No kidding. Well, we have a new class put on it. Yeah, it looks like the new glasses popping off.

161
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.260
It keeps. Wow.

162
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, that's no good.

163
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:43.830
So,

164
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you feel about the conversation you had with your son so good about it.

165
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:59.760
Sandra's iPhone: Um, yeah, but I can. I thought I was a little harsh, but maybe that's what he was looking for. Finally, out of me because I've never said anything.

166
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:00.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

167
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.860
You know,

168
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.240
Sandra's iPhone: Well, I haven't said anything for a long time.

169
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:15.150
Sandra's iPhone: Not since he is like 16 I used to like I I catch him lion to me.

170
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.810
Sandra's iPhone: And I'd be like, I go driving around I drive the streets until I found him.

171
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.220
Sandra's iPhone: And then I'd be like, Hey, you know, with my leather friends flopping it around.

172
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.370
Sandra's iPhone: Trying to act like I'm cool. And then they tell me where the party is and then that was the wrong thing.

173
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's funny.

174
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.360
Sandra's iPhone: Cuz I'd go to the party.

175
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:49.140
Sandra's iPhone: Just be horrible. Mom, I don't know, I tried to care.

176
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.470
Sandra's iPhone: I think we've all experienced that piece. You know what I mean.

177
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

178
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not alone, that is for sure.

179
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:01.800
You know,

180
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I tell my daughter, all the time. She's 38 I tell her that I am so grateful that she survived my parenting and I don't know how she did it, but

181
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.860
Sandra's iPhone: I know my daughter is

182
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.280
Sandra's iPhone: 38 too. And she's not real hip. I mean real

183
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:27.750
Sandra's iPhone: She's been the nicest to me, I guess, but she's now realizing how screwed up. I really was, I think,

184
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But she survived.

185
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

186
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.100
Yeah.

187
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.560
Sandra's iPhone: Yeah, we all did.

188
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

189
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've been. Okay, other than dealing with your physical stuff right now and

190
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay.

191
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you're going to rest for the next couple days. Is that what I heard you say

192
00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:57.960
Yeah.

193
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:08.880
Sandra's iPhone: Okay, well I'm going to go to work after somebody gets there like around 1130s when I'm like ready did leave because I've been there since 830

194
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.520
Sandra's iPhone: So if I go lay down for an hour, then I can go back for

195
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.190
Sandra's iPhone: A few hours come home.

196
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, okay. So you'll just go for a couple hours go back home and then go back for a couple hours later in the

197
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.440
Sandra's iPhone: Afternoon. Yeah.

198
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

199
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you have any more pain. Then what you know you're supposed to have. You're going to go get checked out again.

200
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.170
Sandra's iPhone: Right.

201
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.670
Sandra's iPhone: That the plan.

202
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:49.620
Sandra's iPhone: Is usually they give me like last time they put me and they gave me a shot Delano IV is for kidneys. That's what they usually give me

203
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you make sure that they know that you're on Suboxone right now.

204
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.800
Sandra's iPhone: Right.

205
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.820
Sandra's iPhone: You know, I know. And I told my doctor not yesterday, don't give me any pain pills, so

206
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:12.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, again, you know, they're going to come instances where you're, you're going to need them. And so just know that if you tell them, he'll be able to

207
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work it to where it knocks the Suboxone is off the receptors, you know, in the appropriate manner. You don't want to do it all of a sudden, because that will throw you right into to withdraw, but they can do it in a manner that you know is less harmful, you know,

208
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.980
Sandra's iPhone: Okay. All right. Alright.

209
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So just know that

210
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

211
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you want to be. We just want to tell them

212
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you need something

213
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

214
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, it

215
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is passing a kidney stone worse than having a baby.

216
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.470
Sandra's iPhone: Comparable

217
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.140
Sandra's iPhone: Shows like you're sitting watermelon kinda

218
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.660
Sandra's iPhone: Okay, you know,

219
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:04.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

220
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wonder.

221
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If it is comparable I

222
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: often wonder, you know, with guys and

223
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes

224
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know guys are babies.

225
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And so, in my mind, I'm like, oh my god, it's a kidney stone.

226
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not, maybe, you know, right.

227
00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.210
Sandra's iPhone: Exactly.

228
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But then I had to step back and say, I've never passed a kidney stone. So who am I to judge what the pain is like

229
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.460
Right.

230
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need to ask somebody, and

231
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

232
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.450
Sandra's iPhone: I don't have anything else to say. I'm good.

233
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just run right

234
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.510
Sandra's iPhone: I am. Alright, thanks.

235
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:52.560
Sandra's iPhone: Friday.

236
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.030
All right.
